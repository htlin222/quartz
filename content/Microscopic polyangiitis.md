# Microscopic polyangiitis

* Necrotizing vasculitis commonly involving 
* lung, kidneys, and skin 
* with pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and palpable purpura. 
* Presentation similar to granulomatosis with polyangiitis
* Similar to GPA, but w/o ENT/upper airway involvement & nongranulomatous
* Epidemiology: incidence 4/million/y. ♂ = ♀; avg onset 50–60 y

## Clinical manifestations
Constitutional, neuro sx similar to GPA
Renal (80–100%): glomerulonephritis
Skin lesions (eg, palpable purpura) in 30–60%
Pulmonary (25–50%): pulmonary capillary alveolitis, pulmonary fibrosis

## Dx studies: 
70% ⊕ ANCA (almost all anti-MPO)
Biopsy → necrotizing, nongranulomatous inflammation of small vessels, pauci-immune
Urine sediment and CXR findings similar to those seen in GPA
## Treatment
* as for [[Treatment of Granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] 
* ↓ relapse rate compared to GPA
