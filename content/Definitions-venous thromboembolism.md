# Definitions-venous thromboembolism

## Superficial thrombophlebitis:
	* pain, tenderness, erythema along superficial vein

## [[deep vein thrombosis]]
* Proximal =
	* thrombosis of iliac, femoral, or popliteal veins
	* (nb, “superficial” femoral vein part of deep venous system).
* Distal =
	* calf veins below knee
	* lower risk of PE/death than proximal (Thromb Haem 2009;102:493).

## [[pulmonary embolism]]
	* thrombosis originating in venous system and embolizing to pulmonary arterial circulation; 1 case/1000 person y; 250,000/y (Archives 2003;163:1711)
