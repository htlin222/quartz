### Sarcoma

**Soft tissue sarcoma**

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Rare, heterogeneous tumor of mesenchymal origin. <1% of adult tumors. Most common soft tissue sarcoma = GI stromal tumor (GIST).

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Presents as gradually enlarging, painless mass. May have neuropathy or pain due to local compression. Common locations thigh/buttock/groin (46%) > torso (18%) > upper extremity or retroperitoneum (13% each).

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Percutaneous core biopsy

â€¢Â Â Â Staging: CT chest

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Surgical excision if possible followed by radiation and chemotherapy (AIM = doxorubicin (Adriamycin), ifosfamide, mesna). Consider neoadjuvant therapy for large tumors to shrink tumor before surgery. For metastatic disease, give chemotherapy and consider resection of metastatic sites if limited (metastasectomy).

##### Osteosarcoma

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Rare bone tumor; many are secondary to other conditions in adults (e.g., Paget disease of bone)

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Localized bone pain; systemic symptoms are rare

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: MRI of suspected primary site, biopsy (open vs. core, coordinate location of biopsy with orthopedic surgeon)

â€¢Â Â Â Staging: CT chest

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (doxorubicin \+ cisplatin), surgical resection, and possibly radiation therapy. Chemotherapy for metastatic disease \+/â€“ metastasectomy.
