# Wolff-Chaikoff effect

Blue: WC effect

- Excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification (step 2)
- In individuals with a normal thyroid, the gland escapes from this inhibitory effect
- In individuals with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease), the suppressive effect may persist
