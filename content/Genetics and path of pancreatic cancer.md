# Genetics and path of pancreatic cancer

(Nat Rev Dis Primers 2016;2:16022)
â€¢ Histologic types: adenocarcinoma (~85%), acinar cell carcinoma, endocrine tumors, cystic neoplasms (<10%); rarely, mets to pancreas (eg, lung, breast, renal cell)
â€¢ Location: ~60% in head, 15% in body, 5% in tail; in 20% diffuse infiltration of pancreas
â€¢ Adeno. mut.: KRAS (>90%), p16 (80â€“95%), p53 (50â€“75%), SMAD4 ( 55%), BRCA (10%)

- Arises from:
  - Acinar epithelial cells after acinar to ductal metaplasia
- Most common histology:
  - Adenocarcinoma
  - 70% of tumor mass is nonneoplastic desmoplastic (stromal component) composed of numerous cell types
- Sequential progression:
  - Premalignant PanIN to invasive adenocarcinoma
- PanIN:
  - Increases in histologic grade (1A/B â†’ 2 â†’ 3)
  - Increases in genetic complexity (KRAS mutation/overexpression â†’ p16 loss â†’ p53 & BRCA2 loss)
- Likely slow evolution to invasive disease, over decades:
