# Modified Wells Pretest Probability Scoring for PE

compare: [[clinical prediction rules for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism]]

- **Wells**
  - Patient characteristic: Clinically suspected DVT
  - Unilateral leg swelling
  - Heart rate >**100**/min
  - Immobilization or surgery within the previous 4 wk
  - Previous DVT or PE
  - Hemoptysis
  - Cancer within 6 mo
  - Alternative diagnosis is less likely than pulmonary embolism

## Low or moderate clinical probability of PE
- Clinical gestalt probability of PE is low (<15%) and â‰¥1 items of the PERC score are positive;
- Or clinical gestalt probability of PE is moderate (15%-40%) and D-dimer testing is recommended
- Wells score â‰¤4 or YEARS criteria not present:
	- Use D-dimer threshold of 1000 ng/mL
- Wells score > 4 or YEARS criteria present:
	- Use age-adjusted D-dimer threshold

## High clinical probability of PE
  - Clinical gestalt probability of PE is high (>40%)
    - Or Wells score > 6 or Geneva score > 10
