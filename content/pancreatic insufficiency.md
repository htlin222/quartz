# pancreatic insufficiency

* Chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer - The most common causes of fatty diarrhea with increased fecal fat, increased osmotic gap, and decreased diarrhea with fasting.

* Diagnostic tests - The diagnosis can be made by evaluating stool elastase, chymotrypsin levels, fecal fat, or through an empiric pancreatic enzyme treatment, where the patient takes pancreatic enzymes to see if their symptoms improve. These tests can help determine the cause of the malabsorption and the extent of pancreatic damage.

* Treatment - Treatment for the underlying cause, such as chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, may be necessary to improve symptoms and prevent further damage. In some cases, taking pancreatic enzyme supplements can help improve digestion and reduce symptoms. In addition, a low-fat diet and other dietary changes may be recommended to reduce the strain on the pancreas and improve symptoms.
