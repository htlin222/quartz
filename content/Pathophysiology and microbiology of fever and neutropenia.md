# Pathophysiology and microbiology of fever and neutropenia

- Predisposing factors:
	- catheters,
	- skin breakdown,
	- GI mucositis,
	- obstruction (lymphatics, biliary tract, GI, urinary tract),
	- immune defect associated with malignancy
- Often thought due to seeding of bloodstream by GI flora,
	- eg, GNRs (esp. P. aeruginosa)
- Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis):
	- RLQ pain,
	- watery/bloody diarrhea,
	- cecal wall thickening
- Gram ⊕ infections
	- have recently become more common (60–70% of identified organisms)
- Fungal superinfection often results from
	- prolonged neutropenia & antibiotic use
