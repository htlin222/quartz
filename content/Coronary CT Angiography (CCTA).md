### Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA)

â€¢Â Â Â Indications: Direct anatomic assessment of the coronary anatomy (less sensitive than invasive coronary angiography); CT can increasingly provide physiologic assessment with FFR (fractional flow reserve, a measure of pressure/flow across a coronary lesion); CT-FFR allows clinicians to estimate the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions noninvasively.

â€¢Â Â Â Methods: Noninvasive ECG-gated CT during which contrast is timed to fill the coronary arteries. Heart rate must be low (e.g., <70 bpm) during testing.

â€¢Â Â Â Utility: CCTA is increasingly being used in place of stress testing. In patients with stable angina, CCTA allows clinicians to rule out significant left main CAD (which benefits from revascularization, see Coronary Artery Disease section later), and thus start empiric medical therapy without invasive testing.
