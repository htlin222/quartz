  - Avoid concomitant administration if possible.
- [[QTc-prolonging agents]] (e.g., fluoroquinolones, sotalol)
  - Increased risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias. Monitor QTc.
- Protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)
  - Can result in increased levels of both macrolides and protease inhibitors. Avoid concomitant use if possible.
- Cimetidine
  - Cimetidine can increase levels of macrolides.
