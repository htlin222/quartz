- [[Definition and epidemiology of gout]] ó°’—
- [[Etiologies of gout]] ó°’—

## Diagnosis

- â†‘ UrA is â†’ not diagnostic; 25% of measurements nl during flare; Â± â†‘ WBC & ESR
- Arthrocentesis is â†’ gold standard: intracellular negatively birefringent needle-shaped MSU crystal. U/S w/ double-contour sign or dual-energy CT can aid non-invasive dx.
- 2015 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria (Ann Rheum Dis 2015;74:1789) used 1Â° in research

## Acute treatment (Arthritis Care Res 2020;72:744)

- Colchinine, NSAIDs, & steroids all 1st-line; choice guided by side effect profile/comorbidities.
- IL-1i (J Rheum 2019;46:1345) or ACTH if these contraindicated.
- Start Rx ASAP;
  - continue until acute flare resolves;
  - consider combo Rx if severe;
  - rest/ice;
  - self-limited w/in 3-21+ d w/o Rx.
- Continue urate-lowering therapy during attack if already taking
- [[Table-Acute Treatment for Gout]]

## Chronic treatment

- Approach:
  - if â‰¥2 attacks/y, polyarticular attack, tophus, joint erosions, GFR <60, or urolithiasis
  - â†’ start urate-lowering therapy + pharmacologic Ppx
  - to â†“ risk of acute attacks
- [[Urate-Lowering Therapy]] (Chronic Treatment for Gout)
  - goal UrA _<6 mg/dL_;
  - when starting ULT, always give with pharm Ppx as below;
  - do NOT d/c during acute attack or due to AKI
- Pharmacologic prophylaxis: continue 6 mos w/ above Rx or longer if frequent attacks:
  - low-dose colchicine (~50% â†“ risk of acute flare; J Rheum 2004;31:2429),
  - NSAIDs (less evidence; Ann Rheum Dis 2006;65:1312),
  - low-dose steroids,
  - IL-1 inhibitors
- Lifestyle Î”s:
  - â†“ intake of meat,
  - EtOH,
  - & seafood,
  - â†‘ low-fat dairy,
  - wt loss,
  - avoid dehydration
