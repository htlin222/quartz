# nonstatin drugs

## Ezetimibe:
* Ezetimibe is a generic medication that lowers blood cholesterol level by inhibiting intestinal absorption and is FDA-approved for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and familial hypercholesterolemia.
* In the landmark **IMPROVE-IT** trial (view a NEJM Quick Take video summary and read the NEJM Journal Watch summary), patients who, after a hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, were randomized to combination **simvastatinâ€“ezetimibe** had fewer cardiovascular outcomes than those randomized to simvastatinâ€“placebo.
* The benefit of ezetimibe (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points in the primary outcome) was small, but ezetimibe is one of the few nonstatin agents to demonstrate a hard outcome benefit, and is the statin adjunct of choice for high-risk patients who do not achieve adequate LDL-C reduction.

## PCSK9 Inhibitors:
* In 2015, the FDA approved **aliROCumab** (Praluent) and **evoLOCumab** (Repatha), two drugs in this new class of lipid-lowering agents.
* These drugs augment the uptake of circulating LDL in the liver by inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisinâ€“kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which normally binds LDL receptors for degradation and leads to decreased cellular ability to clear circulating LDL-C.
* They are FDA-approved for adjunctive use in patients with clinical ASCVD or familial hypercholesterolemia who have had an inadequate response to maximal statin therapy.
* The available efficacy data for alirocumab and evolocumab show that PCSK9 inhibitors can significantly lower LDL-C (up to 60%) and evolocumab and alirocumab trials demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with ASCVD.
* Due to the results of the FOURIER trial (read the NEJM Journal Watch summary), evolocumab gained FDA indication to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with existing ASCVD.
* Ezetimibe should be added to maximal statin therapy prior to initiation of a PCSK9-inhibitor.
