### Stones and Obstructions

##### Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)

â€¢Â Â Â Types:

-Â Â Â **Calcium stones** (80%): Radiodense. Calcium oxalate (90%, envelope shape, malabsorption) or calcium phosphate (10%, hyperparathyroidism, RTA).

-Â Â Â **Uric acid stones** (10%): Radiolucent, flat square plates. Hyperuricemia due to gout, tumor lysis syndrome

-Â Â Â **Struvite stones** (5â€“10%): Radiodense; rectangular prisms, staghorn morphology. Recurrent UTIs by protease-producing organism (*Proteus, Klebsiella, Serratia, Enterobacter* convert urea to ammonia, which combines with magnesium or phosphorus to form struvite calculi).

-Â Â Â **Cystine stones** (1%): Poorly visualized by x-ray, hexagon-shaped crystals. Screen with urinary cyanide nitroprusside.

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Acute renal colic (sudden onset, canâ€™t sit still, cramping abdominal/flank pain in waves), nausea/vomiting, dysuria, \+/- fever/chills

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis:

-Â Â Â UA with microscopy (evaluate for microscopic/gross hematuria, crystals)

-Â Â Â Imaging (confirm diagnosis, stone size/location, assess for hydronephrosis): Noncontrast CT abd/pelvis if nephrolithiasis has not been previously established (superior sensitivity, specificity), ultrasound is useful to avoid radiation in patients who may be pregnant

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Acute treatment:

**â€¢**Â Â Â IVF, pain control (NSAIDs > morphine), medical expulsive therapy with an alpha blocker

**â€¢**Â Â Â Urgent stone removal required if:

-Â Â Â Stone unlikely to pass: Stone >10 mm, GU anatomical abnormality

-Â Â Â Infection: UTI, sepsis

-Â Â Â Severe symptoms: Intractable pain or nausea/vomiting

**â€¢**Â Â Â If stone not removed urgently, consider follow-up imaging in 14 days to monitor stone position

â€¢Â Â Â Prevention:

-Â Â Â Adequate fluid intake (goal >2 L urine output/24 hr)

-Â Â Â If high risk for stone recurrence (large stone burden, non-calcium stone, abnormal urological anatomy, history of GI disease or bariatric surgery, family history), then refer for metabolic assessment to tailor preventive measures

-Â Â Â Almost all patients with nephrolithiasis should adhere to a low-sodium diet, which reduces calcium excretion. Other dietary changes may be beneficial based on urine lab abnormalities.

-Â Â Â Pharmacologic treatments include thiazides for hypercalciuria, allopurinol for hyperuricemia, alkali supplementation for hypocitraturia

##### Urinary tract obstruction

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology:

-Â Â Â Lower tract: Neurogenic bladder (e.g., due to diabetes), bladder cancer, BPH, prostate cancer, urethral stricture, blood, stone, trauma

-Â Â Â Upper tract:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Intrinsic: Kidney stones, blood clots, sloughed papillary, tumor, ureteral stricture

**â€¢**Â Â Â Extrinsic: Pregnancy, tumor, abdominal aortic aneurysm, retroperitoneal fibrosis, endometriosis, hematomas, IBD, diverticulitis

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Renal colic and pain (especially if acute), oliguria, recurrent UTIs, hematuria/proteinuria, renal failure

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis:

-Â Â Â Renal ultrasound

-Â Â Â Advanced diagnostics: Intravenous pyelography (IVP) for ureteral obstruction, voiding cystourethrography for lower tract obstruction, cystoscopy for bladder

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Lower tract: Foley Catheter, BPH medications (e.g., alpha-blockers; 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor)

-Â Â Â Upper tract: Ureteral stent via cystoscopy if possible, otherwise percutaneous nephrostomy tube
