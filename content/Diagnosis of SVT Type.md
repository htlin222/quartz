# Diagnosis of SVT Type

(NEJM 2012;367:1438)

## Onset

- Abrupt on/off argues against sinus tachycardia

## Rate

- Not dx b/c most can range from 140-250 bpm, but: ST usually <150; AFL often conducts 2:1 → vent. rate 150; AVNRT & AVRT usually >150

## Rhythm

- Irregular → AF, AFL w/ variable block, or MAT

## P wave

- morphology
- Before QRS (ie, long RP) → ST, at ↣ (P ≠ sinus), MAT (≥3 morphologies)
- None (ie, buried in or deforming terminal QRS, eg, pseudo RSR′ in V1) → typical AVNRT, NPJT
- After QRS (ie, short RP) & inverted in inf. leads (ie, retrograde atrial) → AVNRT, AVRT (usually slightly after QRS; RP interval >100 ms favors AVRT vs. AVNRT), or NPJT
- Fibrillation or no P waves → AF
- Saw-toothed “F” waves (best seen in inferior leads & V1) → AFL

## Response to vagal stim. or adenosine

- Slowing of HR often seen with ST, AF, AFL, AT, whereas reentrant rhythms (AVNRT, AVRT) may abruptly terminate (classically w/ P wave after last QRS) or no response. Occ at ↣ may terminate.
- In AFL & AF, ↑ AV block may unmask “F” waves or fibrillation
