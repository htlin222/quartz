# Ultrasound findings of benign and malignant breast lesions

Ultrasound findings of benign and malignant breast lesions

- Appearance
  - Homogeneous texture or echo-free space
  - Heterogeneous texture, Hypoechoic
- Structure
  - Fluctuant
  - Firm, rigid
- Margins
  - Well-circumscribed lesion with smooth margins
  - Irregular mass with poorly defined, spiculated margins
- Further findings
  - Posterior enhancement (cyst) or thin echogenic rim with pseudocapsules (fibroadenoma)
  - Posterior shadowing
- Further management
  - Regular check-ups Possibly surgical excision
  - Fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy

- In postmenopausal women and women â‰¥ 30 years of age with a suspicious breast mass, mammography is preferred over ultrasound.
- In premenopausal women < 30 years of age, ultrasound is preferred, because the higher density of breast tissue decreases the diagnostic power of mammography.
