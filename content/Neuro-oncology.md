### Neuro-oncology

##### Metastatic brain tumors

â€¢Â Â Â Radiographic findings: Multifocal lesions at the gray-white junction, ring enhancement with contrast

â€¢Â Â Â Common malignancies that metastasize to the brain: Lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, GI malignancies, GU malignancies

##### Primary CNS tumors

â€¢Â Â Â See Hematology/Oncology Chapter 7

##### Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical presentation: Consider paraneoplastic (or autoimmune) encephalitis in patients with subacute onset neurologic symptoms including limbic encephalitis (memory loss, behavior changes, seizures), movement disorders, myelopathy, and/or neuropathy. Higher risk if the patient has a known history of malignancy. Typically, CSF is acellular (though often have abnormal IgG index and oligoclonal bands). MRI brain/spine may show abnormal findings in the limbic system, brainstem, or spinal cord.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: MRI, lumbar puncture with IgG index and oligoclonal bands, serum and CSF autoimmune encephalitis panel, CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, testicular/vaginal ultrasound and/or PET if unknown primary site of malignancy

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat underlying malignancy, may require immunosuppression
