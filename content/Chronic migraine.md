# Chronic migraine

Chronic migraine is defined as
≥15 headache days per month for >3 months
and fulfilment of ICHD-3 criteria for migraine
on ≥8 days per month.

Chronic migraine is not a static entity and reversion to episodic migraine is not unusual.
Similarly, retransformation to chronic migraine can subsequently occur
