# hla_matching

- Tissue-type matching between the donor & recipient at 3+ loci. Mismatch ↑ risk of rejection & GVHD
- HLA genes fall in two categories:
  - Type I = **HLA-A, -B, -C**;
  - Type II = **-DRB1, -DQB1,** -DPB1
- 6/6 = matched at A, B, DR; 8/8 = also C; **10/10 = also DQ**; 12/12 = also DP
- Donors may be related or unrelated; in general, gold standard = 8/8 related donor; direct prospective comparisons re: optimal “alternative” donor are lacking (see below)
