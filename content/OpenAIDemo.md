What are the treatment of lung cancer

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the United States. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer combined.

There are two main types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85 percent of all cases. SCLC is less common but more aggressive, and it accounts for the remaining 15 percent of lung cancers.

Lung cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. The type of treatment that is best for a particular person depends on the stage of the lung cancer (how far it has spread), the person’s overall health, and other factors.

There are many different treatments for lung cancer, depending on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as the person's overall health and preferences. Treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

What is EGFR mutation?

EGFR mutation is a type of genetic mutation that can occur in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor, which is found on the surface of cells. The EGFR protein is involved in signaling pathways that control cell growth and division. Mutations in the EGFR gene can cause abnormally high activity of the EGFR protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of cancer.
