# Locoregional disease-of-gastric cancer

Gastrectomy is potentially curative, >50% relapse; perioperative chemo if â‰¥T2 or N+
Resection: Goal R0 (Complete resection, clear margins [â‰¥4 cm]); âˆ¼50% achieve R0 R1: Microscopic residual dz (+margins); R2: Gross (macroscopic) residual dz
LN dissection: D2 (standard of care)-includes D1 & removal of celiac, gastrohepatic, & splenic LN (15-30 LN for adequate staging); lower locoregional recurrence (12% vs. 22%) & CA-related mortality (37% vs. 48%) compared to D1 (Lancet Oncol 2010;11:439)
D1: Gastrectomy w/ removal of greater & lesser omenta & associated LN
D0: Incomplete resection of greater & lesser curvature LN
dMMR/MSI-H: Always evaluate for mismatch repair deficiency prior to initiating periop Rx
