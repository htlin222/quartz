# 2023-09-28

The options `template_new_note`, `template_new_daily`, and
`template_new_weekly` are used to specify the paths to template text files

The following substitutions will be made during new note creation:

As an example, this is â†’ my template for new notes:
>
    ---
    title: {{title}}
    date:  {{date}}
    ---
<

I use this one for daily notes:
>
    ---
    title: {{hdate}}
    ---
<

And finally, what a template for weekly notes could look like:
>
    ---
    title: {{year}}-W{{week}}
    date:  {{hdate}}
    ---

    # Review Week {{week}} / {{year}}
<
