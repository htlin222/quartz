# Cancer stage

* Refers to tumor location, size, and extent in the body

* Informs the prognosis and treatment plan

* Commonly used staging system: the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification system

> Early stage (I and II): smaller tumors without prominent lymph node involvement or metastases

> Late stage (III and IV): locally advanced disease, invasion of surrounding structures, or an increased number of involved lymph nodes; distant metastatic spread also defines stage IV
