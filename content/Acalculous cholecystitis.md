>
> GB stasis & ischemia (w/o cholelithiasis) â†’ necroinflammation. Occurs in critically ill. A/w postop major surgery, TPN, sepsis, trauma, burns, opiates, immunosuppression, infxn (eg, CMV, Candida, Crypto, Campylobacter, typhoid fever).

Acalculous cholecystitis is a type of cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) that occurs without the presence of gallstones.
It results from stasis and ischemia (lack of blood flow) in the gallbladder, leading to necroinflammation (tissue death and inflammation).

## This condition commonly occurs in critically ill patients and is associated with various factors, such as:

* Postoperative major surgery
* Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* Sepsis
* Trauma
* Burns
* Opiates
* Immunosuppression
* Infections (e.g. CMV, Candida, Crypto, Campylobacter, typhoid fever)
