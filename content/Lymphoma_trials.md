### Lymphoma

- **Bendamustine plus rituximab versus CHOP plus rituximab as first-line treatment for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas: An open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 non-inferiority trial.** _The Lancet_ 2013;381(9873):1203-1210.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized phase 3 non-inferiority trial that randomized patients with previously untreated indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas to bendamustine plus rituximab versus R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). at â†£ median follow-up of 45 months, median progression free survival was significantly longer in the bendamustine plus rituximab group than the R-CHOP group (69.5 months vs. 31.5 months). Thus, bendamustine plus rituximab can be considered as a preferred first line treatment approach in patients with previously untreated indolent lymphomas.
