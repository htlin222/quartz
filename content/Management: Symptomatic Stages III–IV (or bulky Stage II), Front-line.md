# Management: Symptomatic Stages IIIâ€“IV (or bulky Stage II), Front-line
Enrollment in clinical trial should be encouraged
Commonly accepted indications for Rx include: Sx, any node >7 cm or 3 nodes >3 cm, cytopenias, fluid collections (ascites, pleural effusions), organ impairment & leukemic phase of disease (JCO 1998;16:2332)
Multiple front-line therapeutic options. Choice of Rx is based on pt & disease characteristics, including: volume & distribution of disease, age & functional status of the pt, potential need for rapid response, or concern for transformed disease (see below)
Rituximab is a monoclonal Ab directed at the B-cell Ag CD-20. Efficacy has been shown w/ both single-agent & combination Rx
Rituximab monotherapy (4 weekly doses) is used 1Â° in pts w/ low volume disease. ORR ~70â€“75%, CR ~40â€“45% in untreated pts (JCO 2005;23:1103)
Rituximab plus chemotherapy is more often used. Standard regimens include R-CHOP, R-Bendamustine, R-CVP. Addition of rituximab to chemotherapy improves RR, PFS, & OS over chemo alone. No single regimen is preferred, & individual pt factors guide choice
Obinutuzumab plus chemotherapy â†’ obinutuzumab maintenance should be given if maintenance anti-CD20 therapy is planned. Obinutuzumab-chemo â†’ obinutuzumab maintenance improves PFS compared to rituximab plus chemotherapy â†’ rituximab maintenance (GALLIUM Study, ASH 2016).
Maintenance and Consolidation Therapy
Maintenance dosing of rituximab after completing initial Rx improves PFS but not OS (JNCI 2011;103:1799)
No trials have directly evaluated the role of maintenance obinutuzumab. If maintenance therapy is recommended, obinutuzumab-chemo â†’ obinutuzumab maintenance is superior to R-chemo â†’ R maintenance (GALLIUM Study, ASH 2016).
RIT also improves PFS but not OS, converts some PRs to CRs (JCO 2008;26:5156)
