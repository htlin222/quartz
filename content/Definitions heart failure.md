# Definitions heart failure

> > 各種定義

- Failure of heart to pump blood forward at rate sufficient to meet metabolic demands of peripheral tissues, or ability to do so only at abnormally high cardiac filling pressures
- Low output (↓ cardiac output) vs. high output (↑ stroke volume ± ↑ cardiac output)
- Left-sided (pulmonary edema) vs. right-sided (↑ JVP, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema)
- Backward (↑ filling pressures, congestion) vs. forward (impaired systemic perfusion)
- Systolic (inability to expel sufficient blood) vs. diastolic (failure to relax and fill normally)
- Reduced (HFrEF, EF <40%), mildly reduced (HFmrEF, EF 40–49%), & preserved (HFpEF, EF >50%); combination of systolic and diastolic dysfxn may occur regardless of EF
