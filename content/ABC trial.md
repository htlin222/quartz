# ABC trial

Anthracyclines in Early Breast Cancer: The ABC Trials-USOR 06-090, NSABP B-46-I/USOR 07132, and NSABP B-49 (NRG Oncology)

## Comparison of Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (TC) with Taxane and Cyclophosphamide (TaxAC) Regimens in Early Breast Cancer: A Joint Efficacy Analysis of Three Randomized Trials

1. Design:
   - Phase: III
   - Multi-center, randomized trials
   - Women were randomly assigned to either TC or TaxAC regimens
   - Joint efficacy analysis of TC versus TaxAC regimens was planned before any analysis of individual trials
   - Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) was the primary end point
   - Prespecified interim monitoring plan was to report for futility if the HR was > 1.18 when 334 IDFS events were observed
   - Patients who received TC6 plus bevacizumab on NSABP B-46-I/USOR 07132 were not included
2. Number of patients:
   - 2,125 patients received TC6 regimens
   - 2,117 patients received TaxAC regimens
3. Patient characteristics:
   - Patients with high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer
4. Agent:
   - TC or TaxAC regimens
5. Treatment line: Adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer

| Endpoint                              | TC6   | TaxAC | P-value |
| ------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| Invasive Disease-Free Survival (IDFS) | 88.2% | 90.7% | 0.04    |

8. Other findings in this trial:
   - The HR for TC6 versus TaxAC was 1.202 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.49), which triggered early reporting for futility.
   - Tests for treatment interaction by protocol, hormone receptor status, and nodal status were negative.
9. Summary:
   The TaxAC regimens were found to be superior to the TC6 regimen in improving IDFS in patients with high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. The trial did not report any significant differences in PFS, OS, or RR between the two regimens.
