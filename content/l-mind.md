[[tafasitamab.md|Tafasitamab]] plus lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (L-MIND): a multicentre, prospective, single-arm, phase 2 study

- At a median follow-up of 13.2 months, the
  - objective response rate (ORR) was 60% (48/80 patients, efficacy set),
  - complete response (CR) rate was 43% (34/80 patients),
  - partial response (PR) rate was 18% (14/80 patients).

**Information**

- **Design**: Phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial
- **Number of patients**: 81
- **Patients characteristics**: Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation
- **Agent**: Tafasitamab (MOR208) plus lenalidomide
- **Treatment line**: Second-line therapy or later
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: L-MIND (NCT02399085)

**Results**

- **Primary endpoint**: Objective response rate (ORR)
- **Response rate**: 60% (95% CI, 48-71)
  - Complete response rate: 43% (95% CI, 32-54)
  - Partial response rate: 18% (95% CI, 10-28)

**Other findings**

- **Safety**: The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (48%), thrombocytopenia (17%), and febrile neutropenia (12%)
- **Serious adverse events**: 51% of patients experienced a serious adverse event, with the most frequent being pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, pulmonary embolism, bronchitis, atrial fibrillation, and congestive cardiac failure

**Summary**
The L-MIND trial demonstrates that tafasitamab plus lenalidomide is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation, with a high response rate and complete response rate.
