# sensible and insensible fluid losses

## Insensible losses (nonmeasurable)
* Lungs: 200 mL
* Skin: 600 mL
* Sweat: Variable

## Sensible losses (measurable)
* Fecal: 200 mL
* Urine: 800 to 1500 mL

These losses account for 2000 to 2500 mL/day, giving a 24-hour fluid requirement of 30 to 35 mL/kg to maintain normal fluid balance.
