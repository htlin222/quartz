# [[Nonscarring alopecia]]

## Telogen Effluvium

- Clinical Characteristics:
  - Diffuse shedding of normal hairs
- Pathogenesis:
  - Follows major stress (high fever, severe infection) or change in hormone levels (postpartum)
  - Stress causes more asynchronous growth cycles of individual hairs to become synchronous, leading to larger numbers of growing (anagen) hairs simultaneously entering the dying (telogen) phase
- Treatment:
  - Observation
  - Discontinue any drugs that have alopecia as a side effect
  - Must exclude underlying metabolic causes (e.g., hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism)

## Androgenetic Alopecia (Male Pattern; Female Pattern)

- Clinical Characteristics:
  - Miniaturization of hairs along the midline of the scalp
  - Recession of the anterior scalp line in men and some women
- Pathogenesis:
  - Increased sensitivity of affected hairs to the effects of androgens-most common cause
  - Increased levels of circulating androgens (ovarian or adrenal source in women)-less common cause
- Treatment:
  - Topical minoxidil
  - Finasteride (oral)
  - Spironolactone (women)
  - Hair transplant
  - Low-dose oral minoxidil

## Alopecia Areata

- Clinical Characteristics:
  - Well-circumscribed, circular areas of hair loss, 2-5 cm in diameter
  - In extensive cases, coalescence of lesions and/or involvement of other hair-bearing surfaces of the body
  - Pitting or sandpapered appearance of the nails
- Pathogenesis:
  - The germinative zones of the hair follicles are surrounded by T lymphocytes
  - Occasional associated diseases: hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, vitiligo, Down syndrome
- Treatment:
  - Topical anthralin or tazarotene
  - Intralesional glucocorticoids
  - Topical contact sensitizers
  - JAK inhibitors

## Tinea Capitis

- Clinical Characteristics:
  - Varies from scaling with minimal hair loss to discrete patches with "black dots" (sites of broken infected hairs) to boggy plaque with pustules (kerion)
- Pathogenesis:
  - Invasion of hairs by dermatophytes, most commonly Trichophyton tonsurans
- Treatment:
  - Oral griseofulvin or terbinafine plus 2.5% selenium sulfide or ketoconazole shampoo
  - Examine family members

## Traumatic Alopecia

- Clinical Characteristics:
  - Broken hairs, often of varying lengths
  - Irregular outline in trichotillomania and traction alopecia
  - Fringe sign in traction alopecia
- Pathogenesis:
  - Traction with curlers, rubber bands, tight braiding
  - Exposure to heat or chemicals (e.g., hair straighteners)
  - Mechanical pulling (trichotillomania)
- Treatment:
  - Discontinuation of offending hair style or chemical treatments
  - Diagnosis of trichotillomania may require observation of shaved hairs (for growth) or biopsy, possibly followed by psychotherapy
