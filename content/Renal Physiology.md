### Renal Physiology



**FIGURE 6.2: Diagram of the nephron**. The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney that uses four mechanisms to process the filtrate: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. First, blood flows through Bowmanâ€™s capsule, and fluid and solutes are filtered out to form a glomerular filtrate. The proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting ducts are sites for the reabsorption of water and ions. Shown are the sites at which ions are moved in each segment. The site where each diuretic functions along the nephron is also indicated.
