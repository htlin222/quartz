**FIGURE 5.3: Hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“thyroid axis.** Shown is the hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“thyroid axis, which regulates the production of thyroid hormones. The enzyme 5â€² iodinase converts the biologically inactive thyroxine (T4) to the active form of thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3). Conversion of T4 â†’ T3 can be inhibited by environmental conditions (illness, starvation) or medications (propylthiouracil \[PTU\], propranolol). T4 can also be converted to reverse T3 (rT3), which is a biologically inactive metabolite of thyroxine. Green arrows indicate stimulatory actions, and red lines indicate inhibitory actions. Abbreviations: TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; T4, thyroxine; T3, triiodothyronine; rT3, reverse triiodothyronine.
