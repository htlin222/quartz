### Thrombocytosis

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: High number of platelets (platelets >450K/Î¼l)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies:

-Â Â Â Reactive (most cases): Extrinsic to megakaryocyte

**â€¢**Â Â Â Differential diagnosis: Iron deficiency, blood loss, post-splenectomy, infection, rebound thrombocytosis, IBD, malignancy

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treatment: Treat underlying problem, do not give aspirin

-Â Â Â Autonomous: Clonal process involving megakaryocyte or precursor

**â€¢**Â Â Â Differential diagnosis: Myeloproliferative diseases â€“ polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), CML

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treatment: Treat by disease state. If thrombosis, hemorrhage (due to acquired vWD), or symptoms of stasis, consider aspirin, hydroxyurea, thrombocytopheresis/plateletpheresis.
