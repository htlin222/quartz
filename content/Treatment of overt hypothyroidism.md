# Treatment of overt hypothyroidism

- Levothyroxine (1.5–1.7 µg/kg/d), re ✓ TSH q5–6wk, titrate q8-12 wks if TSH not in range
- Lower starting dose (0.3–0.5 µg/kg/d) if at risk for ischemic heart disease or elderly
- ↑ dose typically needed if:
  poor GI absorption: meds that ↓ absorption (iron, calcium, cholestyramine, sucralfate, PPI), celiac disease, IBD
  [[meds that accelerate T4 catabolism]] (eg, phenytoin, phenobarbital)
  initiation of estrogen replacement; pregnancy (~30% ↑ by wk 8): TSH goals change by trimester: 1st = 0.1–4.0 mIU/L, 2nd & 3rd = gradual return of TSH to nonpregnant nl range (Thyroid 2017;3:315)
