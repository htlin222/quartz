# calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate - cppd - deposition disease

## Definition (NEJM 2016;374:2575)

- Deposition of CPPD crystals w/in tendons, ligaments, articular capsules, synovium, cartilage; frequently asymptomatic

## Etiologies (Nat Rev Rheumatol 2018;14:592)

- Most cases idiopathic; consider further metabolic eval in young (<50 y) and florid forms
- Metabolic (3 Hâ€™s):
  - hemochromatosis
  - hyperparathyroidism;
  - hypomagnesemia (esp. in Gitelmanâ€™s or Bartterâ€™s syndromes)
- Joint trauma (incl. previous surgery);
- intra-articular hyaluronate can precipitate attacks
- Familial chondrocalcinosis (autosomal dominant disorder); early-onset, polyarticular dis.

- [[Diagnostic studies of CPPD]]

## Treatment (NEJM 2016;374:2575)

- Asymptomatic chondrocalcinosis requires no treatment
- Acute therapy for pseudogout: no RCTs, extrapolated from practice in gout; âˆ´ same as for gout, though colchicine not as effective
- If associated metabolic disease, Rx of underlying disorder may improve arthritis sx
- Low-dose daily colchicine or NSAID may be effective for prophylaxis or chronic arthropathy
