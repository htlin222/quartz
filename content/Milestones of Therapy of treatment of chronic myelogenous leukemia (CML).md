## BCR-ABL1 ratio <10% IS = 1-log reduction by QT- PCR
* early molecular response
* 3 mo

## BCR-ABL1 ratio <1% IS = 2-log reduction by QT-PCR (CCyR)
* complete cytogenetic response
* 6 mo

## BCR-ABL1 ratio <0.1% IS = 3-log reduction by QT-PCR (MMR)
* major molecular response
* 12 mo

## BCR-ABL1 ratio

**BCR-ABL1 mRNA**:Â **ABLÂ mRNA** in peripheral blood.

International Scale (IS) standardizes across labs by normalizing toÂ BCR-ABL1:ABL1 ratio in a cohort of unRxâ€™d patients.
