### Regular Atrial Rhythms

##### Sinus tachycardia (ST)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies: Infection, hypovolemia/hemorrhage, hypoxia, anemia, anxiety, PE, alcohol withdrawal, hyperthyroidism. In the outpatient setting in a patient with chronic sinus tachycardia without an underlying cause consider: 1) Chronic inappropriate sinus tachycardia or 2) Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat underlying etiology

##### SA node reentrant tachycardia (SANRT)

â€¢Â Â Â Description: Reentrant loop in the SA node; hard to discern from sinus tachycardia except rapid on/off. Relatively rare rhythm.

##### AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)

â€¢Â Â Â Description: Reentrant circuit using fast and slow circuits within the AV node.

â€¢Â Â Â ECG: Regular, narrow QRS with rate usually 120â€“220 bpm, no P waves (buried, occasionally can see pseudo-Râ€™ in V1, pseudo-S in inferior leads; only recognizable when comparing to the patientâ€™s normal QRS), short RP interval.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Acute: 1) Vagal maneuvers and 2) IV adenosine (breaks) (Table 1.8). Chronic: Ablation vs. nodal blocking agents.

##### AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT)

â€¢Â Â Â Description: Reentrant circuit using the AV node and accessory pathway; frequently occurs in patients with Wolf-Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome (Table 1.9)


**TABLE 1.9 â€¢ Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) and WPW Syndrome**




â€¢Â Â Â Subtypes:

-Â Â Â Orthodromic (85%): Impulse travels down through the AV node and up through an accessory pathway. Narrow QRS, regular, rate often >200 bpm (Figure 1.14).

-Â Â Â Antidromic (15%): Impulse travels down through an accessory pathway and up through the AV node. Wide QRS, regular (can look like VT), rate often >200 bpm.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: 1) Vagal maneuvers, 2) IV adenosine (breaks), 3) Nodal agents

##### Atrial tachycardia (AT)

â€¢Â Â Â Description: Impulse generated at a focus of enhanced automaticity in the atria other than the SA node. Associated with CAD, COPD, alcohol use, digoxin use; can occur in the absence of heart disease.

â€¢Â Â Â ECG: P wave often looks different than a sinus P wave; atrial rate usually 110â€“250 bpm, ventricular rate can be regular or irregular (if variable block); narrow QRS, long RP interval; frequently occurs in recurrent self-terminating bouts.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Short-term use of BB or CCB. Long-term: BB, CCB, ablation.

##### Atrial flutter (Aflutter)

â€¢Â Â Â Description: Irritable focus in the atria with reentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus. Associated with mitral valve/tricuspid valve stenosis or regurgitation, or due to aging. Can occur in the absence of heart disease.

â€¢Â Â Â ECG: Saw-toothed flutter waves best seen in leads II, III, aVF, or V1; atrial rate typically ~300 bpm; ventricular rate slower and can be regular (most common) or irregular (if variable AV nodal block); atrial to ventricular conduction usually in even ratio (e.g., 2:1 = 150 bpm, 4:1 = 75 bpm) (Figure 1.14).

-Â Â Â Counterclockwise flutter (most common) = inverted flutter waves in the inferior leads

-Â Â Â Clockwise flutter = upright flutter waves in the inferior leads

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Similar to treatment of Afib.

-Â Â Â Acutely: Rate control with metoprolol, diltiazem, but note that flutter is usually more difficult to rate control than Afib. If unable to rate control, consider TEE/cardioversion.

-Â Â Â Chronically: Consider anticoagulation (by same criteria as Afib), ablation (success rate >90% in ablating flutter).
