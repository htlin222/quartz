# Initial Treatment: Transplant Ineligible Patients of mantle cell lymphoma

- No generally accepted standard of care, & pts will have a multiply relapsing course; clinical trial enrollment encouraged
- R-Bendamustine is a/w at least equivalent & possibly longer PFS w/ less tox c/w R-CHOP (BRIGHT Study, Blood 2014;123:2944 & STIL Study, Lancet 2013;381:1184)
Multiple active regimens include rituximab in combination w/ CHOP, bendamustine, CVP, & lenalidomide
- Maintenance rituximab improves OS after response to R-CHOP but not R-FC or BR (NEJM 2012;367:520, Rummel, ASCO, 2016). Thus, cannot be extrapolated to all regimens
