# bcl6

BCL6 functions as an oncogene and is located on chromosome 3q27. The BCL6 protein acts as a transcriptional repressor and aids in the control of a number of cellular processes, including activation, differentiation, and cellular apoptosis. In normal B cells, BCL6 is a key regulator of the germinal center reaction and modulates the apoptotic response in germinal center B cells (GCBs). Specifically, BCL6 suppresses the activity of P53, MYC, and the BCL2 family of proteins. Translocations involving BCL6 contribute to lymphoma by preventing normal BLC6 protein downregulation in postgerminal center B cells.31-33
