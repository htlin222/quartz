# Pulmonary embolism checklist

## Initial management

- perform ABCDE assessment.
- provide analgesia and oxygen therapy as needed.
- Unstable patients (i.e., massive PE): Stabilize, obtain ECG, and consider bedside echocardiogram and empiric therapy based on bleeding risk.
- assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation for VTE.
- consider empiric anticoagulation if the bleeding risk is low.
- evaluate RV function to determine the severity of PE.
- consult PERT.

## Nonmassive PE

- Low bleeding risk: Start anticoagulation with a DOAC or heparin.
- High bleeding risk: Consider IVC filter placement.
- Consider outpatient management; see ‚ÄúRisk stratification and disposition.‚Äù

## Submassive PE

- Low bleeding risk: Start anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH.
- High bleeding risk: Consider IVC filter placement.
- Consider thrombolysis for PE in select patients, e.g., those with continued clinical deterioration.
- admit to ICU or telemetry.

## Massive PE

- evaluate the need for mechanical ventilation.
- have a crash cart at the bedside.
- consider limited IV fluid therapy for hemodynamic support (e.g., 250-500 mL crystalloid fluid IV once).
- begin vasopressor infusion for hemodynamic support if needed.
- check for contraindications to thrombolysis for PE.
- no absolute contraindications: Initiate thrombolysis for PE.
- absolute contraindications: Consult interventional radiology and/or surgery to perform embolectomy for PE.
- continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry.
- transfer to ICU.
