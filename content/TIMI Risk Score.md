> TIMI Score

## Calculation of Risk Score

### Historical
    Age ≥65 y
    ≥3 Risk factors for CAD
    Known CAD (stenosis ≥50%)
    ASA use in past 7 d
### Presentation
    Severe angina (≥2 episodes w/in 24 h)
    ST deviation ≥0.5 mm
    ⊕ cardiac marker (troponin, CK-MB)

## Application of Risk Score
| Score | D/MI/UR by 14 d |
| 0–1   | 5%              |
| 2     | 8%              |
| 3     | 13%             |
| 4     | 20%             |
| 5     | 26%             |
| 6–7   | 41%             |

> Higher risk Pts (TRS ≥3) derive ↑ benefit from LMWH, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors and early angiography (JACC 2003;41:89S)
