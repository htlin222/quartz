# double-hit in DLBCL

- [[High-grade B-cell lymphoma]] w/ _MYC & BCL2_ &/or BCL6 translocations by FISH (formerly “[[double-hit in DLBCL]]”) represent ∼8% of all DLBCL & have poorer prog.
- IHC detected [[double_expressors.md|double expressors]] (MYC >40% BCL2 >70%) may be assoc w/ ↓ prog (JCO 2012;30:3460).

- 要明確排除 DHL，需要對所有侵襲性淋巴瘤檢體進行 FISH 檢測：但可以先看看是不是 GCB，再看一下 MYC/BCL2 Positive by IHC

BCL2 indicates B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2; BCL6, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6; DLBCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; GCB, germinal center B cell; HGBL, high-grade B-cell lymphoma; IHC, immunohistochemistry.
  - cf. [[double_expressors]]

## Treatment

- Identify DHL/THL (MYC-R/BCL2-R) (especially GCB)
- Identify DEL
- DHL/THL: intensive chemotherapy: lenalidomide (DA-EPOCH-R / R-CODOX-M/IVAC/ R-HyperCVAD)
- Non-GCB + DEL: smart start protocol, R-CHOP + BTKi
- Non-GCB, age less than 60-65 years: R-CHOP + BTKi
- ABC, age > 60 years, man, IPI of 3-5: Pola-R-CHP
- A subset of patients with ABC type: R-CHOP + Velcade
- IPI of 3-5 and fit: DA-EPOCH-R, frontline ASCT in IPI of 4-5 ?
- Future perspectives: molecular clustering, ctDNA, next generation immunotherapy (CAR T-cell therapy,...)
