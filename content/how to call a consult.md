## how to call a consult

•   Consult question: In general, consults should be structured around a *specific question* in regard to a patient’s care (e.g., Should this patient with melena undergo inpatient endoscopic evaluation? Should this patient with suspected DAH in the presence of rheumatologic disease receive high dose steroids?”)

•   1Consult timing: Practice patterns differ across institutions, however when possible non-urgent consults should generally be made early in the day to allow consulting teams to plan their day’s workflow.

•   Consult template: A template for paging a consultant is provided in Table A1.6.
