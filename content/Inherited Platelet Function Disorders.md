# Inherited Platelet Function Disorders

| Defect Type | Name              | Inheritance       | Characteristics                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Adhesion    | Bernard-Soulier   | AR                | Defective GPIb-IX-V complex                         |
|             | DiGeorge Syndrome | 22q11.2 deletion, | reduced and large platelets, multiple abnormalities |
| Aggregation | Glanzmann         | AR                | Reduced or qualitative defect in GPIIb/IIIA         |
| Granule     | Chediak-Higashi   | AR                | Reduced Œ¥-granules, immunodeficiency                |
|             | Hermansky-Pudlak  | AR                | Reduced Œ¥-granules, oculocutaneous albinism         |

Platelet disorders [9]
Platelet deficiency (see ‚ÄúEtiology‚Äù in ‚ÄúThrombocytopenia‚Äù)
Platelet dysfunction (thrombocytopathy): disorders that lead to dysfunctional adhesion or aggregation of platelets
Inherited
Von Willebrand disease
Bernard-Soulier syndrome
Glanzmann thrombasthenia
Acquired
Drug-induced: e.g., aspirin, NSAID, clopidogrel
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
Chronic kidney disease
Cardiopulmonary bypass [10]
See also ‚ÄùDifferential diagnosis of platelet disorders.‚Äù
Disorders affecting the vessel wall
Vascular hemorrhagic diathesis (e.g., IgA vasculitis, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia)
Thrombotic microangiopathy (e.g., HUS and TTP)
Conditions with impaired collagen synthesis (e.g., scurvy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)
Pathophysiology
Typical presentation
Peripheral smear
