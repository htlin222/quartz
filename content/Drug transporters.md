# Drug transporters

## P-gp (MDR-1)

- P-gp & its encoding gene MDR-1 (ABCB1) expressed in high levels in brain vessels, adrenal glands, kidney, liver, & GI tract
- P-gp is involved in the transport of hydrophobic drugs including doxorubicin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, hormones, & carcinogens
- Multidrug resistance proteins act as drug efflux pumps rendering cells resistant to cytostatic drugs
- Three most common SNPs are P-gp\*6 (22-56% in Caucasians), P-gp\*7, & P-gp\*8
