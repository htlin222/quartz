# Gastrointestinal bleeding checklist

## All inpatients

- NPO
- ABCDE survey
- Consider continuous cardiac monitoring.
- IV fluid resuscitation as needed
- Transfuse pRBCs if Hb ‚â§ 7-8 g/dL (‚â§ 9 g/dL for unstable or high-risk patients).
- Obtain routine laboratory studies (e.g., CBC, coagulation panel, blood type and crossmatch, liver chemistries).
- Conduct pre-endoscopy risk stratification to determine diagnostic and therapeutic approach.
- Consider withholding antithrombotic agents as needed.
- Consider anticoagulant reversal.
- Consult specialist(s) for source control: e.g., gastroenterology, general surgery, interventional radiology.
- Evaluate and treat the underlying condition.
- Clinical monitoring, serial CBC and coagulation panel
- Admit to ward or critical care unit based on pre- and post-endoscopy risk stratification (See ‚ÄúHigh-risk features of GI bleeding‚Äù)

## Suspected UGIB

- consider intubation if risk of airway compromise.
- start empiric pharmacological treatment if indicated.
- PPI infusion for suspected PUD
- octreotide for suspected esophageal variceal bleeding
- Refer for EGD and endoscopic hemostasis.
- Patient unstable despite resuscitation: Consider angioembolization or surgery.
- See ‚ÄúGlasgow-Blatchford score‚Äù to help guide disposition.

## Suspected LGIB

- Stable patients: Refer for colonoscopy
- Perform EGD first for unstable patients with hematochezia and any of the following:
- High PTP of UGIB
- Moderate PTP of UGIB with positive or inconclusive NG aspirate
- Consider colonoscopy first for unstable patients with hematochezia and all of the following:
- Moderate PTP of UGIB and negative NG aspirate
- Able to tolerate rapid bowel prep
- Consider angiography for patients with refractory hemodynamic instability
- Consider surgery if other options have failed
