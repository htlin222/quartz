## Normal

![V1,V6](https://i.imgur.com/93o0KE6.png)
Initial depol. left to right across septum (r in V1 & q in V6; nb, absent in LBBB) followed by LV & RV free wall, with LV dominating (nb, RV depol. later and visible in RBBB).

## RBBB

![RBBB EKG](https://i.imgur.com/K5yt4gf.png)

1. QRS ≥120 msec (110-119 msec = IVCD or “incomplete”)
2. rSR′ in R precordial leads (V1, V2)
3. Wide S wave in I and V6
4. ± ST↓ or TWI in R precordial leads

## LBBB

![LBBB EKG](https://i.imgur.com/ghxfU9G.png)

1. QRS ≥120 msec (110-119 msec = IVCD or “incomplete”)
2. Broad, slurred, monophasic R in I, aVL, V5-V6 (± RS in V5-V6 if cardiomegaly)
3. Absence of Q in I, V5, and V6 (may have narrow q in aVL)
4. Displacement of ST & Tw opposite major QRS deflection
5. ± PRWP, LAD, Qw’s in inferior leads
