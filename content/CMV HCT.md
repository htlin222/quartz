## Primary Regimens

### Preemptive Strategy

- Monitor weekly for CMV viremia by PCR (or antigenemia) for 3-6 months post transplant with consideration for more prolonged monitoring in patients at risk for late-onset CMV disease (chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) requiring systemic treatment, patients receiving high-dose steroids, T-cell depleted or cord blood transplant recipients, and CD4 < 100 cells/mL).
- Start treatment with identification of CMV viremia or antigenemia.

### Treatment

- Valganciclovir 900 mg po bid or
- Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q12h until clearance of viremia, but for not less than 2 weeks.
- At that point of viremia clearance, either switch to secondary prophylaxis (below) or resume preemptive approach.

### Prophylaxis

- Letermovir 480 mg IV or po q24h
- Valganciclovir 900 mg po q24h (beginning post-engraftment):
