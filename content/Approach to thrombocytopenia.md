- isolated thrombocytopnea otherwise normal complete ðŸ©¸ count and smear
  - autoimmune disease? meds? infection?
    - [[ITP]]
    - 2ndary immune, medications, infections
- abnromal complete ðŸ©¸ count and/or smear
  - spherocytes: Evan's synd.
  - schistocytes:
    - disseminated intravascular coagulation
    - hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
    - Mech. circulation support
  - pancytopenia and or blasts:
    - [[aplastic anemia]]
    - myelodysplastic syndrome [[MDS]]
    - [[leukemia]]
  - leukoerythroblastic: [[meylophthisis]] a.k.a fibrosis

- TLDR: 
- Step 1 if the count less than 150k, than check if anemia 
- if anemia, do bone marrow
- else check smear:
    - if Fragmented RBC: MAHA
    - else: survey for 2nd (Drug, Infection, and Congential)
    - then ITP
