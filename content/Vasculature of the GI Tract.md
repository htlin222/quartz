### Vasculature of the GI Tract


**FIGURE 4.3: [[Arterial supply to the upper GI tract]].** The celiac trunk gives rise to the common hepatic artery (supplies the region shaded in purple), the left gastric artery (supplies the region shaded in green), and the splenic artery (supplies the region shaded in blue). Additional arterial branches supply the proximal duodenum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen.
