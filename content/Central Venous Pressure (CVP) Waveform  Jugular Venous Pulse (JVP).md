# Central Venous Pressure (CVP) Waveform  Jugular Venous Pulse (JVP) #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Central Venous Pressure (CVP) Waveform / Jugular Venous Pulse (JVP)

â€¢Â Â Â **a** wave: **a**trial contraction

â€¢Â Â Â **c** wave: RV **c**ontraction (closed tricuspid valve bulging into the atrium)

â€¢Â Â Â **x** descent: Atrial rela**x**ation and downward displacement of the closed tricuspid valve during ventricular contraction

â€¢Â Â Â **v** wave: Increased RA pressure during systole because passive filling against a closed tricuspid **v**alve

â€¢Â Â Â **y** descent: Tricuspid valve opens and empt**y**ing blood from RA fills RV
