# Hormone-positive disease-neoadjuvant therapy-of-localized breast cancer

Chemo: Consider for downstaging breast &/or axillary nodes for BCS & to spare ALND in inoperable or cN1 pts. ddACT preferred in this instance. Chances of pCR âˆ¼20%, but pCR not strongly assoc w/ survival outcome
Neoadj endocrine therapy (NET): Preferred regimen: AI for at least 6 mos. NET may have equal BCS rates & clinical response as combination chemo (JAMA Oncol 2016;2:1477). pCR rate: NET < NAC
All AIs equal (JCO 2011;29:2342) & AI > tam (Lancet Oncol, 13:345-352)
Adding CDK4/6 not rec-no clear benefit in pCR rate vs. AI alone & vs. chemo. New biomarkers under investigation (Ann Oncol 2018;29:2334-2340: summarizes results of NeoPalAna, neoMONARCH, NeoPAL trials)
Premenopausal pts w/ cN1 â†’ Chemo preferred (RxPONDER: NEJM 2021;385:2336-2347)
Triple negative disease-of-localized breast cancer
Stage I: pT1aN0: No chemo; pT1b/c: Discuss w/ pt; pT2: Recommend chemo
Clinical Stage II-III: NAC rec for T â‰¥ 2 cm. Preferred regimens: ddACT, CMF or TC if anthracycline contraindicated
Adding carbo to NAC â†‘ pCR, independent of BRCA status, but conflicting data on DFS impact (â†‘ in GeparSixto, [Lancet Onc 2014;15:747]; no effect in CALGB 40603 [JCO 2014;33:13])
Addition of ICI: Remains under investigation
After NAC: If pCR â†’ observation. If nonpCR â†’ capecitabine (cape) for 6-8 cycles (recurrence & survival benefit) (CREATEX, NEJM 2017;376:2147-2159)
Pathologic stage II-III: Adj. chemo is rec (anthra & taxane-based regimens as above. CMF or TC if anthra contraindicated)
