# management of Pathologic stage I to IIIA NSCLC

- Surgery: VATS/ robotic-assisted surgery standard where possible, lobectomy w/ mediastinal node dissection preferred. If +margins, reresection preferred over RT
- RT: If medically inoperable: SBRT, standard RT (60 Gy), radiofrequency or cryoablation. Multidisciplinary discussion mandatory
- Adj. Chemo: Not recommended for stage IA, consider for stage IB (med onc consult mandatory). â†‘ OS for stage II-IIIA, CIS doublet for 4 cycles (LACE, JCO 2008;26:3552), most studies used CIS/vinorelbine (NEJM 2005;352:2589), CIS/peme, & CIS/docetaxel w/ similar efficacy & â†‘ tolerability
- Adj. Targeted Rx: EGFR TKIs have DFS benefit, OS benefit inconclusive; osimertinib x3y for EGFR Mt stage II-IIIA DFS benefit
- PORT: Potential benefit if N2 nodes, +margins. Rad onc consultation recommended for N2
- Multiple 1Â° Lung CAs: Different histologies or same histology w/o mediastinal LN involvement or extrathoracic mets-treat by stage as separate primaries (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1975;70:606)
