# Diagnosis-aseptic meningitis

- Obtain LP for CSF analysis: lymphocytic pleocytosis common in viral etiologies (see Typical CSF Findings in Meningitis table above)
- Consider CSF cytology and MRI brain/spine to evaluate for malignancy
- Consider serum autoimmune and serum viral testing in appropriate settings if CSF is unrevealing and there is no improvement with empiric treatment
