# cynosis

central cyanosis can be detected reliably when the SaO2 has fallen to 85%; in others, particularly in dark-skinned persons, it may not be detected until it has declined to 75%

In general, cyanosis becomes apparent when the concentration of [[reduced hemoglobin]] in capillary blood exceeds 40 g/L (4 g/dL).
當毛細血管血中還原血紅蛋白的濃度超過 40 g/L (4 g/dL) 時，紫紺就會變得明顯。

## Central Cyanosis
Decreased arterial oxygen saturation
 Decreased atmospheric pressure—high altitude
 Impaired pulmonary function
  Alveolar hypoventilation
  Inhomogeneity in pulmonary ventilation and perfusion (perfusion of hypoventilated alveoli)
  Impaired oxygen diffusion
 Anatomic shunts
  Certain types of congenital heart disease
  Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas
  Multiple small intrapulmonary shunts
 Hemoglobin with low affinity for oxygen
## Hemoglobin abnormalities
 Methemoglobinemia—hereditary, acquired
 Sulfhemoglobinemia—acquired
 Carboxyhemoglobinemia (not true cyanosis)
## Peripheral Cyanosis
## Reduced cardiac output
## Cold exposure
## Redistribution of blood flow from extremities
## Arterial obstruction
## Venous obstruction
