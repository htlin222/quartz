# Staging of breast cancer

- [[tldr-of-Staging of breast cancer]]
- [[Regional Lymph Nodes-of-Staging of breast cancer]]
- [[Breast carcinoma TNM staging AJCC UICC 2010]]

- Anatomic: tumor size, chest wall invasion, axillary LN mets (strongest prognostic factor)
- [[Primary tumor T of breast cancer]]
- Histopathologic: type (little prognostic relevance) & grade; lymphatic/vascular invasion
    In situ carcinoma: no invasion of surrounding stroma
    Ductal (DCIS): ↑ risk of invasive cancer in ipsilateral breast (~30%/10 y)
    Lobular (LCIS): benign entity; marker of ↑ risk of inv. cancer in either breast (~1%/y)
    Invasive carcinoma: infiltrating ductal (70–80%); invasive lobular (5–10%); tubular, medullary and mucinous (10%, better prognosis); papillary (1–2%); other (1–2%)
    Inflammatory breast cancer (see above): not a histologic type but a clinical reflection of tumor invasion of dermal lymphatics; very poor prognosis
    Paget disease (see above): ductal cancer invading nipple epidermis ± associated mass
- Tissue biomarkers: estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR), HER2
- Oncotype DX 21-gene expression recurrence score predicts which ER ⊕, HER2 ⊖ will have minimal benefit from adjuvant chemo in LN ⊖ (NEJM 2018;379:111) and LN ⊕ (1–3) disease (NEJM 2021;385:2336)

| Stage  | Characteristics                               | Description           | 5-y DSS |
|        |                                               |                       |         |
| I      | Tumor       ≤2 cm                             | Operable locoregional | 99%     |
| IIA    | Tumor >2 cm or mobile axillary nodes          | =                     | 98%     |
| IIB    | Tumor >5 cm or 2–5 cm w/ mobile nodes         | =                     | 96%     |
| IIIA   | Internal mammary or fixed axillary nodes      | Locally advanced      | 95%     |
| IIIB/C | Chest wall, skin, infra or supraclavic. nodes | Inoperable 80–85%     | 完了    |
| IV     | Distant metastases                            | Metastatic            | 27%     |
