# crs_and_icans_after_bsab

[[cytokine_release_syndrome.md|Cytokine Release Syndrome]] (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) are two of the most serious adverse events associated with bispecific antibody (BsAb) therapy:

- CRS is an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response triggered by the effects of T-cell engaging therapies like BsAbs, causing release of inflammatory cytokines. CRS symptoms range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe multi-organ failure[1].

- ICANS is neurologic toxicity caused by the inflammatory actions of cytokines released after BsAb therapy, disrupting the blood-brain barrier and causing accumulation of cytokines in the central nervous system. Symptoms include headache, confusion, hallucinations, tremors, ataxia, aphasia, seizures, and cerebral edema[1][2].

- ICANS typically develops within 2-3 days after onset of CRS, though it can occur concurrently or independently. CRS does not always precede ICANS[1][2][4].

- Rates of CRS and ICANS vary across BsAb trials, but are generally lower than with CAR-T cell therapies. In one study, the CRS rate was 17.5% (all grade 1-2) and ICANS rate was 8% (3% grade 3-4). Another reported 14.5% overall neurotoxicity, with 3% ICANS [all grade 1-2](3)[4].

- Prompt diagnosis and management is critical to prevent irreversible damage. Supportive care includes antipyretics, fluids, vasopressors, antibiotics, and respiratory support. Immunosuppression with steroids is the mainstay for moderate-severe CRS and ICANS. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, can be used for severe CRS but is less effective for established ICANS[2][4].

- Temporary or permanent BsAb discontinuation may be necessary for severe toxicity. Consultation with specialists is recommended for management[2].

In summary, CRS and ICANS are serious but manageable complications of BsAb therapy that require close monitoring and prompt treatment to optimize outcomes.
