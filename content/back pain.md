## initial [[evaluation of back and spinal cord disease]]

* [[differential diagnosis of back pain]]
* [[History taking of back and spinal cord disease]]
* [[general physical exam of back pain]]:
* [[signs of radiculopathy]] (sharp/lancinating pain radiating into limb):
* Neurogenic claudication in lumbar stenosis (see table on next page)
* [[Neuro exam of back and spinal cord disease]]
* [[Red flags of back and spinal cord disease]]:
* [[Laboratory of back and spinal cord disease]]
* Neuroimaging: low yield if nonradiating pain, high false âŠ• rate (incidental spondylosis); depending on suspicion: X-rays, CT or CT myelography, MRI, bone scan
* EMG/NCS: may be useful to distinguish root/plexopathies from peripheral neuropathies
