# Treatment-Vitamin B12 deficiency


* 1 mg B12 IM qd × 7 d → q wk × 4–8 wk → q month for life

* neurologic abnormalities are reversible if treated w/in 6 mos

* folate can reverse hematologic abnormalities of B12 deficiency but not neurologic changes (and can “steal” B12 stores → worsening of neuro complications)

* oral supplementation (2 mg qd) appears feasible as well (Cochrane Rev CD004655) even w/o IF
