# Background of vasculitis
* [Vasculitis Pathophysiology Overview - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9h6-LPySPI&ab channel=ArmandoHasudungan)
* [Vasculitis | Clinical Presentation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfdeBT7e-dc&ab channel=Medscape)
## Classified 
* by size of predominant vessel affected (Arthritis Rheum 2013;65:1); overlap of vessel size affected is common
	* 看一下這張圖：![Distribution of vessel involvement](https://i.imgur.com/dzJB1GR.png)
	* 有很多部分會重疊：注意是所有種的都會影響到大中小，所以不能排除
	 
## Clinical manifestations 
* based on size of vessels involved; specific symptom
* constitutional sx (low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, myalgias, anorexia) 
	* common to all from inflammatory response

## Vasculitis is typically divided into 2 main categories:
* primary (idiopathic)
* secondary, caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune process, infection, a neoplastic process, or certain medications

- Vasculitis can occur in any vessel type in any organ system of the body.
- It ranges in severity from a self-limiting, single-organ condition to a multiorgan disease that leads to end organ failure.
