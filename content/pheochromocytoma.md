# pheochromocytoma

## Clinical manifestations (NEJM 2019;381:552)

- Neuroendocrine neoplasm leads to inappropriate and paroxysmal release of adrenergic agents including epinephrine, norepinephrine, and rarely dopamine
- Classic triad: 頭痛、心悸、流汗
  - episodic headaches, palpitations and profuse sweating;
  - only 50% have paroxysmal hypertension and most Pts do not have three classic sx
- Paroxysms can be triggered by meds (eg, β-blockers 會引發), abdominal manipulation
- Up to 40% of pheos/paragangliomas thought to have underlying genetic etiology; genetic testing frequently recommended
- Associated with

  - MEN2A/2B MEN2
  - [[von Hippel-Lindau]]
  - NF1
  - familial paraganglioma (mutations in succinate dehydrogenase gene B, C and D),
  - MAX or TMEM127 mutations

- [[Diagnostic studies of pheochromocytoma]] 󰒗

- Treatment
  - α-blockade first (usually phenoxybenzamine) ± β-blockade (often propranolol) → surgery
  - _Preoperative volume expansion_ is → critical due to possible hypotension after tumor excision
