# pembro

In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients with previously untreated stage II or stage III triple-negative breast cancer to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 mg) every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (784 patients; the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (390 patients; the placebo-chemotherapy group); the two groups then received an additional four cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo, and both groups received doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or epirubicin-cyclophosphamide. After definitive surgery, the patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were a pathological complete response at the time of definitive surgery and event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.
