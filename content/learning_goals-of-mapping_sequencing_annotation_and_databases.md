# learning_goals-of-mapping_sequencing_annotation_and_databases

1. **[[historical_background_of_genetics.md|Historical Background of Genetics]]**  
   Understand the progression from Darwin and Mendel's foundational theories through the work of Morgan and Sturtevant, to the identification of DNA's double-helix structure and the inception of the Human Genome Project.

2. **[[understanding_genetic_maps.md|Understanding Genetic Maps]]**  
   Learn to distinguish among various types of genetic maps, including genetic linkage maps, chromosome banding patterns, restriction maps, and DNA sequences.

3. **[[linkage_and_genetic_association.md|Linkage and Genetic Association]]**  
   Comprehend the relationships between linkage, linkage disequilibrium, haplotypes, and the collection of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data.

4. **[[evolution_of_dna_sequencing.md|Evolution of DNA Sequencing]]**  
   Explore the development of DNA sequencing techniques from the early innovations to modern automated high-throughput systems.

5. **[[primer_extension_reaction.md|Primer Extension Reaction]]**  
   Understand the primer extension reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerase and its termination by dideoxynucleoside triphosphates.

6. **[[polymerase_chain_reaction.md|Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR)**  
   Appreciate the significance of PCR for amplifying specific DNA sequences from a mixture.

7. **[[sequencing_project_strategies.md|Sequencing Project Strategies]]**  
   Grasp the significance of reads, overlaps, contigs, and assemblies in organizing a sequencing project.

8. **[[sequencing_gels_and_autoradiography.md|Sequencing Gels and Autoradiography]]**  
   Familiarize with the use of sequencing gels and the benefits of fluorescent chain-terminating dideoxynucleoside triphosphates.

9. **[[advancements_in_high-throughput_sequencing.md|Advancements in High-Throughput Sequencing]]**  
   Understand recent developments in high-throughput sequencing and the future objectives for its advancement.

10. **[[whole-genome_sequencing_approaches.md|Whole-Genome Sequencing Approaches]]**  
    Contrast hierarchical whole-genome sequencing strategies using maps and BAC clones with the whole-genome shotgun approach.

11. **[[genetic_testing_techniques.md|Genetic Testing Techniques]]**  
    Learn about the methods used in genetic testing based on sequence determination.
