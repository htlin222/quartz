# ACLS Tachycardia Algorithm

* [[electrocardiography]]

* unstable = hypotension, change of MS, s/s shock, chest pain, heart failure

r/o sinus tach
Synch cardioversion (rarely needed for HR <150)

* [[narrow complex]] (QRS <120 msec)
* [[wide complex]] (QRS 2120 msec)
* [[cardioversion of ACLS Tachycardia Algorithm]]
