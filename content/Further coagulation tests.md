# Further coagulation tests

(JAMA 2016;316:2146)

## [[Mixing study]]
>> [[Mixing study]]

- useful if â†‘ PT or PTT;
- mix Ptâ€™s plasma 1:1 w/ normal plasma and retest
- PT/PTT normalizes
  â†’ factor deficiency; then âœ… Coagulation factor levels
- PT/PTT remains elevated
  â†’ factor inhibitor

## Coagulation factor levels

- useful if mixing study suggests factor deficiency
- DIC â†’ all factors consumed;
  âˆ´ â†“ factors V and VIII ðŸŽ±
- Liver disease
  â†’ â†“ all factors except VIII;
  âˆ´ â†“ factor V, normal factor VIII
- Vitamin K deficiency
  â†’ â†“ factors II, VII, IX, X (and protein C, S);
  âˆ´ normal V and VIII

## DIC screen

- â†“ fibrinogen
  (consumed)
- fibrin degradation products
  (FDPs, âŠ• from intense fibrinolysis),
- â†‘ D-dimer
  (more specific FDP test that detects degradation of X-linked fibrin)
