# Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes Including Aplastic Anemia and Myelodysplasia

* [[aplastic anemia]]
* [[myelodysplastic syndromes]] (MDS)
* [[pure red cell aplasia]] (PRCA)
* [[myelophthisis]]

---

**Hypoproliferative anemia** is a cardinal feature of these disorders,

---

[[differential diagnosis of pancytopenia]]

---

* frequent is pancytopenia: anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
* Low blood counts in marrow failure result from deficient hematopoiesis, as distinguished from blood count depression due to peripheral destruction of red cells (hemolytic anemias), platelets (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP] or due to splenomegaly), and granulocytes (as in the immune leukopenias).
* secondary: infection, inflammation, or cancer.

---

* Separation between aplastic anemia and hypocellular MDS can be particularly difficult.
* Mutations on genomic screens
