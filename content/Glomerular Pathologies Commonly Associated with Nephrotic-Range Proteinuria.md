### Glomerular Pathologies Commonly Associated with Nephrotic-Range Proteinuria

##### **Minimal change glomerulopathy (MCG, “minimal change disease”**)

•   Epidemiology: Most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, less common in adults

•   Pathophysiology:

-   Defined by nephrotic-range proteinuria and kidney biopsy with little or no change to the glomerular structure on light microscopy

-   Primary MCD is idiopathic

-   Secondary MCD may be associated with atopic disease, mononucleosis, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, medications (e.g., NSAIDS, interferon, lithium)

•   Treatment: Steroids 4–8 weeks, good prognosis

##### Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)

•   Epidemiology: Most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in black adults

•   Pathophysiology:

-   Defined by proteinuria and scarring in scattered glomeruli on biopsy

-   Primary FSGS may result from genetic mutations in podocyte proteins

-   Secondary FSGS is associated with HIV (“collapsing” type), obesity, heroin use

•   Treatment:

-   Steroids or calcineurin inhibitors: 40–60% achieve remission, others have refractory disease and often advance to ESRD.

-   Can recur in the transplanted kidney and is thought to be due to a soluble factor that has yet to be identified.

-   Plasmapheresis can be utilized to remove this soluble factor to help prevent recurrence.

##### Membranous glomerulopathy (MGN, “membranous nephropathy𔄦)

•   Epidemiology: Second most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in U.S. adults after diabetic nephropathy

•   Pathophysiology:

-   Primary MGN is associated with the anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (anti-PLA2R) antibody; majority of cases are primary

-   Causes of secondary MGN: SLE, hepatitis B, solid tumor malignancy (lung, breast, and GI carcinomas), medications (penicillamine, NSAIDs, mercury, captopril)

•   Diagnosis: Diagnosis requires a kidney biopsy, which shows deposits of IgG and C3

•   Clinical features: Higher propensity for thromboembolic events (particularly renal vein thrombosis)

•   Treatment: Up to one-third of patients will experience spontaneous remission; treatment with immunosuppression is considered for patients with a poor prognosis.

-   <4 g protein/day: Good prognosis for remission

-   4–8 g protein/day: Possible chance of remission

-   >8 g protein/day: Poor chance of remission, start treatment immediately
