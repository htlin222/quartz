### Endocarditis

â€¢Â Â Â **\[Guideline\] Infective endocarditis in adults: Diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: A scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American heart association.** *Circulation*. 2015;132(15):1435â€“1486.

-Â Â Â This clinical guideline update on infective endocarditis includes key changes to the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis, including the addition of specific criteria for *Coxiella burnetii* testing as a major criterion for diagnosis of infective endocarditis and the removal of minor echocardiographic criteria.

â€¢Â Â Â **Comprehensive diagnostic strategy for blood culture-negative endocarditis: A prospective study of 819 new cases**. *Clin Infect Dis.* 2010;51(2):131â€“140.

-Â Â Â This prospective, multimodal study incorporated serological, molecular, and histopathological assays to investigate 819 cases of culture-negative endocarditis (CNE). This study highlighted the major role of zoonotic agents in cases of CNE, including *Bartonella* and *Coxiella* spp., as well as the previously underappreciated prevalence of noninfectious diseases. This study contributed to the evidence that shifted the evaluation of CNE from HACEK organisms towards zoonotic organisms and noninfectious processes.
