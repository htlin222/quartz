### Diseases of the Pleura

â€¢Â Â Â Pleural Effusion:

-Â Â Â Thoracentesis should be performed for new effusion to calculate Lightâ€™s criteria

-Â Â Â Lightâ€™s criteria: Must have at least one to be considered exudative:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pleural **P**rotein/serum protein >0.5 (think **P** for **P**entagon \[five-sided\])

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pleural LD**H**/serum LDH >0.6 (think **H** for **H**exagon \[six-sided\])

**â€¢**Â Â Â LDH >2/3 upper limit of normal

â€¢Â Â Â Transudative: Increased hydrostatic pressure (CHF), decreased oncotic pressure (cirrhosis, nephrotic, other hypoalbuminemia). pH 7.4â€“7.55

â€¢Â Â Â Exudative: Increased permeability or decreased lymphatic drainage (infection, malignancy, connective tissue disease, CABG, PE). pH 7.3â€“7.45; <7.2 typical for empyema

-Â Â Â Other useful features: High amylase (pancreatitis, malignancy), milky fluid (chylothorax, lymphatic), bloody fluid (malignancy; may need multiple thoracenteses to increase yield of cytology if malignancy expected), lymphocytic predominance and/or ADA elevation (TB)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Transudative: Diuretics, sodium restriction

-Â Â Â Exudative: Treat underlying process. If complicated, involve pulmonology to discuss therapies like indwelling pleural catheters, chest tubes, etc. See Empyema in Infectious Diseases Chapter 8.

##### Pneumothorax

â€¢Â Â Â Spontaneous:

-Â Â Â Primary: Typically occurs in tall lean men when a dilated alveolar bleb ruptures.

-Â Â Â Secondary: Complication of lung disease, resulting in more severe symptoms

â€¢Â Â Â Traumatic: Iatrogenic (e.g., central line, thoracentesis â€“ always check post-procedure CXR). Mediastinum shifts TOWARD pneumothorax.

â€¢Â Â Â Tension: Accumulation of air with one-way valve collapses ipsilateral lung and mediastinum shifts AWAY from the pneumothorax. Causes: Mechanical ventilation, CPR, trauma. Medical emergency\! Perform immediate needle thoracostomy (large-bore needle; fifth intercostal space, mid-axillary), followed by chest tube placement.
