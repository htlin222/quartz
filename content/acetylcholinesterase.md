# acetylcholinesterase

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is â†’ a cholinergic enzyme primarily found at â†£ postsynaptic neuromuscular junctions, especially in muscles and nerves. It immediately breaks down or hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh), a naturally occurring neurotransmitter, into acetic acid and choline.
