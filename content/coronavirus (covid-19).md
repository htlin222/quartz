- Person-to-person transmission via respiratory particles; asx & pre-sx transmission can occur
- Incubation period: up to 14 days, median time of 4–5 days from exposure to sx onset

## Presentation

- Ranges from asx to severe illness. Of those with sx, 81% mild-to-moderate, 14% severe (hypoxia), 5% critical (ARDS, shock, multiorgan failure) (JAMA 2020:323;13)
- Common sx: fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, myalgias, HA, N/V, diarrhea, loss of smell/taste
- Risk factors for severe illness: age ≥65, CVD, DM, stroke, lung dx, CKD, obesity
  Diagnosis
- RT-PCR testing of nasopharynx, lower respiratory tract, or anterior nares
- Rapid antigen testing of anterior nares (less Se than PCR)
- CXR: typically bilateral opacities (esp peripheral), can be nl early; consider CT if dx ?
