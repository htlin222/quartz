- often administered prophylactically after chemotherapy regimens associated with high incidence of neutropenic fever (seeÂ Table 1. Risk of Febrile Neutropenia, According to the Type of Cancer and Chemotherapy Regimen)
- may be given prophylactically after low- or intermediate-risk chemotherapy regimens in older patients or patients with high-risk comorbidities
