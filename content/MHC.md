# MHC

Definitions

Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
主要組織相容性複合體 (MHC)

The group of genes on the short arm of chromosome 6 (p6) that encodes human leukocyte antigens (HLA) which are considered being highly polymorphic leading to a large difference in the resultant expressed proteins on human cells. They are divided into MHC I and MHC II
6 號染色體 (p6) 短臂上編碼人類白細胞抗原 (HLA) 的一組基因被認為具有高度多態性，導致人類細胞上表達的蛋白質產生巨大差異。它們分為MHC I和MHC II

Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) 人類白細胞抗原 (HLA)

These are the proteins expressed on the cellular surface and play an important role in alloimmunity.
這些是在細胞表面表達的蛋白質，在同種異體免疫中起著重要作用。

HLA can be divided into (HLA-A, B, and C) which are encoded by class I MHC and are expressed on all cell types and present peptides derived from the cytoplasm and are recognized by CD8+ T cells.
HLA 可分為（HLA-A、B 和 C），它們由 I 類 MHC 編碼，在所有細胞類型上表達，呈遞源自細胞質的肽，並被 CD8+ T 細胞識別。

The other HLA type is classified as (HLA- DP, DQ, and DR) which are encoded by MHC II and can be found on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and this class is recognized by CD4+ T cells.
另一種 HLA 類型被分類為（HLA-DP、DQ 和 DR），它們由 MHC II 編碼，可以在抗原呈遞細胞 (APC) 上找到，並且此類被 CD4+ T 細胞識別。
