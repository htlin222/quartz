### Peripheral Eosinophilia and Hypereosinophilia Syndromes

â€¢Â Â Â Definition

-Â Â Â Eosinophilia: Absolute eosinophil count >500/Î¼l (500â€“1500/Î¼l more likely due to atopic disease)

-Â Â Â Hypereosinophilia: Severe eosinophilia >1500/Î¼l; worry especially if >5000/Î¼l since risk of end organ damage increases (e.g., eosinophilic dermatitis, myocarditis, hepatitis)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies:

-Â Â Â Neoplasms:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Monoclonal: Primary hypereosinophilic syndrome (can check for mutations like PDGFRB, PDGFRA, FGFR-1, AEL, and CEL, which cause a monoclonal eosinophil proliferation)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Polyclonal: T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, some solid organ malignancies cause reactive eosinophilia (e.g., cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, SCC, gastric and colon cancer, urothelial cancer)

-Â Â Â Allergies, which includes asthma and drug-induced eosinophilia (including DRESS)

-Â Â Â Adrenal insufficiency

-Â Â Â Connective tissue diseases: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (eGPA) and rheumatoid arthritis

-Â Â Â Parasites

**â€¢**Â Â Â Lymphatic filiariasis, toxocara, trichinosis and strongyloides can all cause an eosinophil count >5000/Î¼l. Only multicellular parasites cause eosinophilia.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Other infections may also cause lower degrees of eosinophilia (e.g., ABPA, cocci, HIV)

-Â Â Â Organ-restricted hypereosinophilic conditions (e.g., eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic cellulitis, etc.) can cause peripheral eosinophilia
