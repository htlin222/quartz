* Long-acting inh antimuscarinics (LAMA; eg, tiotropium, umeclidinium): may consider if sx despite ICS+LABA (JAMA 2018;319:1473)

* Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA): some Pts very responsive, esp. ASA-sens and exercise-induced. Warning for serious neuropsychiatric effects, including suicide.
