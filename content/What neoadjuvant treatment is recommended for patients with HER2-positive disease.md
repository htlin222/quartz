# What neoadjuvant treatment is recommended for patients with HER2-positive disease

Recommendation 5.1.
Patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative, HER2-positive disease should be offered neoadjuvant therapy with an anthracycline and taxane or non-anthracycline-based regimen in combination with trastuzumab. Pertuzumab may be used with trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).

Recommendation 5.2.
Patients with T1a N0 and T1b N0, HER2-positive disease should not be routinely offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy or anti-HER2 agents outside of a clinical trial (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
