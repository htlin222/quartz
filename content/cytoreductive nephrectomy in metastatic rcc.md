# cytoreductive nephrectomy in metastatic rcc

- Benefit depends on pt selection. 2 phase III trials reported in 2001 showed â†‘ OS w/ nephrectomy + IFNÎ± vs. IFNÎ± alone (NEJM 2001;345:1655; Lancet 2001;358:9286).
- However, the [[carmena trial.md|CARMENA trial]] showed â†‘ OS w/ sunitinib alone vs. nephrectomy + sunitinib (NEJM 2018;379:417).
- Best candidates for nephrectomy are intermediate-risk pts w/ limited metastatic burden & low perioperative risk; avoid up-front surgery in pts w/ urgent need for systemic dz shrinkage or where operative complications could delay systemic therapy
