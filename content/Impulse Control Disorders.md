### Impulse Control Disorders

â€¢Â Â Â Intermittent explosive disorder: Recurrent aggressive outbursts, out of proportion with stressor, then remorse (unlike antisocial personality). Treatment: CBT, pharmacotherapy (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, anti-psychotics, beta-blockers, anxiolytics).

â€¢Â Â Â Kleptomania: Uncontrollable urge to steal objects not needed for money or use. Pleasure/relief when stealing, but shame/guilt afterward. Treatment: CBT or insight-oriented psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy (anti depressants, anticonvulsants, or anxiolytics).

â€¢Â Â Â Pyromania: Multiple episodes of deliberate fire setting; often tension/arousal before, then pleasure/relief afterward. Fascination with fires. Better prognosis in children. Treatment: CBT, pharmacotherapy (anti-depressants, anticonvulsants).
