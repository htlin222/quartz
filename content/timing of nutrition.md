# timing of nutrition #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

Timing of nutritional support is an important factor in ICU patients. Although data are inconclusive, early enteral feeding **(within 48 hours of ICU admission)** is thought to decrease the risk of infection. However, no evidence of benefit exists for starting parenteral nutrition early.

In one study, 90-day mortality in patients started on early (within 48 hours) or late (after day 7) parenteral nutrition was similar. However, early IV nutrition was associated with **increased risk of infection and a longer hospital stay**. In practice, when enteral feeding is not an option, most patients are not started on IV nutrition until day **7âˆ’10** in the ICU .

In a 2018 study, no differences in mortality or secondary infections were found between **early enteral versus early parenteral nutrition** in ventilated patients with shock. However, early enteral feeding was associated with **increased risk of bowel ischemia**. (Note that in this study, nutrition was initiated at target rate, which is not done in practice).
