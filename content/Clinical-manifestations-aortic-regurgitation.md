# Clinical-manifestations-aortic-regurgitation


* Acute: sudden ↓ forward SV and ↑ LVEDP (noncompliant ventricle) → pulmonary edema ± hypotension and cardiogenic shock
* Chronic: clinically silent while LV dilates (to ↑ compliance to keep LVEDP low) more than it hypertrophies → chronic volume overload → LV decompensation → CHF
* Natural hx: variable progression (unlike AS, can be fast or slow); once decompensation begins, prognosis poor w/o AVR (mortality ~10%/y)
