### Adrenal Masses

##### Incidentally discovered adrenal mass

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Common (at least 2% in the general population, more common with increasing age)

â€¢Â Â Â Differential diagnosis:

-Â Â Â Nonfunctioning mass: Benign adenoma (most common), hemorrhage, lipoma, cyst, malignancy (metastasis from another site more common than primary adrenal malignancy)

-Â Â Â Functioning mass: Pheochromocytoma, adenoma or carcinoma that produces catecholamine, aldosterone, or cortisol

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis:

-Â Â Â Consider need to screen for excess hormones (consider pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, and cortisol secretion)

-Â Â Â Identify patients who are at risk for malignancy (risk factors: >4 cm adrenal mass, patient with known malignancy)

-Â Â Â Imaging characteristics (density <10 Hounsfield units \[HU\] on CT suggests adrenal adenoma, and makes malignancy much less likely)

-Â Â Â Almost never biopsy an adrenal mass

##### Adrenocortical carcinoma

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Rare, associated with excessive production of adrenal hormones and local mass effect (abdominal fullness). Typically poor prognosis.
