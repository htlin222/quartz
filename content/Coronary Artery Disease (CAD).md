### Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

â€¢Â Â Â **FAME-2.** *N Engl J Med* 2012;367(11):991â€“1001.

-Â Â Â In this trial, 888 patients with stable CAD for whom PCI was being considered underwent, fractional flow reserve (FFR) testing to measure the percentage of functionally significant stenosis. Patients with at least one functionally significant lesion were randomly assigned to FFR-guided PCI plus best medical therapy vs. best medical therapy alone. This trial demonstrated that FFR-guided PCI reduced the composite endpoint of death, nonfatal MI, and urgent recatheterization in patients with stable CAD compared to best medical therapy alone.

â€¢Â Â Â **SYNTAX.** *N Engl J Med* 2009;360:961â€“972.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 1800 patients with previously untreated three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease (or both) to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) vs. PCI. In this trial, rates of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at 12 months were significantly higher in the PCI group (17.8%, vs. 12.4% for CABG; P = 0.002). Therefore, CABG remains the standard of care for patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease.

â€¢Â Â Â **ISCHEMIA.** *N Engl J Med* 2020;382:1395â€“1407.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 5179 patients with moderate to severe stable coronary disease to conservative strategy (medical management) vs. early interventional strategy (revascularization). There was no significant difference in ischemic cardiovascular events or death over a median of 3.2 yr.

â€¢Â Â Â **ORBITA.** *The Lancet* 2017;391:31â€“40.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 230 patients with stable coronary artery disease and ischemic symptoms to revascularization of flow-limiting lesions vs. a placebo procedure. There was no difference in exercise time or symptom scores at 6 weeks follow up.
