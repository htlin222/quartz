# Diagnostic studies of solitary pulmonary nodule

- PET: detects metab. activity of tumors, 97% Se & 78% Sp for malig (esp if >8 mm). Useful for deciding which lesions to bx vs. serial CT & for surgical staging b/c may detect mets.
- Transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB): if tech feasible, 97% will obtain definitive tissue dx
- Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): for percutaneously inaccessible lesions; highly sensitive and allows resection
- Transbronchial bx (TBB): most lesions too small to sample w/o endobronchial U/S; bronch w/ brushings low-yield unless invading bronchus; navigational bronch 70% yield
- PPD, fungal serologies, ANCA
- [[The National Lung Screening Trial]], NLST
