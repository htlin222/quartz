# Common biases in clinical reasoning

## Availability
下了自己熟的的診斷
Considering easily remembered diagnoses more likely irrespective of prevalence

## Base rate neglect
找了斑馬
Pursuing "zebras”

## Representativeness
忽略了怪怪的地方
Ignoring atypical features that are inconsistent with the favored diagnosis

## Confirmation bias
已經有了成見
Seeking data to confirm, rather than refute the initial hypothesis

## Premature
太早下了診斷
closure Stopping the diagnostic process too soon
