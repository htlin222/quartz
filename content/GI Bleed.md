### GI Bleed

> è©³è¦‹[Transfusion strategies for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23281973)
-Â Â Â Randomized controlled trial that randomized 921 patients with severe acute UGIB to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfuse for Hgb <7 g/dL) or a liberal transfusion strategy (transfuse for Hgb <9 g/dL). The restrictive strategy reduced further bleeding, and a subgroup analysis revealed improved survival with the restrictive strategy for patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh A or B disease (but not Class C). Of note, exclusion criteria included massive exsanguinating bleeding, ACS, CVA/TIA, recent trauma/surgery, or LGIB.

> è©³è¦‹[Clopidogrel with or without omeprazole in coronary artery disease.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20925534)

-Â Â Â Double-blind, randomized controlled trial that randomized patients on clopidogrel and aspirin to receive omeprazole vs. placebo. Prophylactic PPI reduced the rate of upper GI bleed.
