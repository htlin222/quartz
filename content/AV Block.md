# AV Block

(Circ 2019;140:e382)
Type Features

## 1°

- Prolonged PR (>200 ms), all atrial impulses conducted (1:1).

## 2° Mobitz I (Wenckebach)

- Progressive ↑ PR until impulse not conducted (→ "grouped beating").
- AV node pathology:
  - ischemia (IMI),
  - inflammation (myocarditis, endocarditis, MV surgery),
  - high vagal tone (athletes),
  - drug induced.
- Classically (~50%), absolute ↑ in PR decreases over time (→ ↓ RR intervals, duration of pause <2× preceding RR interval); nl QRS.
- AVB usually
  - worsens w/ carotid sinus massage,
  - improves w/ atropine.
- Often paroxysmal/nocturnal/asx, no Rx required.

## 2° Mobitz II

- Blocked impulses w/ consistent PR interval, often prolonged QRS
- His-Purkinje pathology:
  - ischemia (AMI),
  - degeneration of conduction system, infiltrative disease, inflammation.
- AVB may improve w/ carotid sinus massage, may worsen w/ atropine.
- May progress to 3° AVB. Pacing pads; transven. pacing often required.

## 3° (complete)

- No AV conduction. Escape, if present, narrow (jxnal) or wide (vent.)
- Nb, if 2:1 block, cannot distinguish type I vs. II 2° AVB (no chance to observe PR prolongation); usually categorize based on other ECG & clinical data. High-grade AVB usually refers to block of ≥2 successive impulses
