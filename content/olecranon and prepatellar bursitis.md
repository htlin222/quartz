# olecranon and prepatellar bursitis

## Epidemiology & risk factors (Joint Bone Spine 2019;86:583)

- > 150 bursae in the body; 2 most commonly infected are olecranon and prepatellar
- Most commonly (esp. superficial bursae) due to direct trauma, percutaneous inoculation, or contiguous spread from adjacent infection (eg, cellulitis)
- Other risk factors: recurrent noninfectious inflammation (eg, gout, RA), diabetes
- S. aureus (80%) most common, followed by streptococci

## Diagnosis

- Physical exam: discrete bursal swelling, erythema, maximal tenderness at â†£ center of bursa with preserved joint range of motion
- Aspirate bursa if concern for infxn, âœ“ cell count, Gram stain, bacterial cx, crystals
  WBC >20k w/ poly predominance suspicious for bacterial infection, but lower counts very common (crystals do not rule out septic bursitis!)
- Assess for adjacent joint effusion, which can also be septic
- Do not tap through infected skin to avoid introducing infxn into bursa

## Initial therapy

- Prompt empiric coverage for staphylococci and streptococci: PO abx acceptable for mild presentation; vancomycin if ill appearing; broaden spectrum based on risk factors
- Modify antibiotics based on Gram stain, culture results, & clinical course. Duration of Rx is â†’ 1-3 wks. Serial aspirations every 1-3 d until sterile or no reaccumulation of fluid.
- Surgery if unable to drain bursa through aspiration, evidence of foreign body or necrosis, recurrent/refractory bursitis w/ concern for infxn of adjacent structures
