* Females > 50 years old. 阿嫲
* Unilateral headache, possible temporal artery tenderness, jaw claudication.
* May lead to irreversible blindness due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. 
* Associated with [[Polymyalgia rheumatica]]

* Most commonly affects branches of carotid artery.
* Focal granulomatous inflammation A . elevated of ESR. IL-6 levels correlate with disease activity.

* Granulomatous arteritis typically involving aorta/branches; predilection for extracranial branches of carotid a., particularly temporal a. (thus also called temporal arteritis).
* Epidemiology: 90% >60 y, peak incidence at 70–80 y, extremely rare <50 y; ♀:♂ = 3:1. Prev 2/1000 of those age ≥50 (Semin Arthritis Rheum 2017;47:253).

* [[diagnosis of Giant cell arteritis]]: 
* Rx: steroids: do not await bx/path! Have >2 wks to bx w/o Δ. Pred 40–60 mg/d w/ slow taper; ASA if critical cerebral narrowing; consider IV steroids if vision threatened (Arthritis Rheumatol 2021;73:1349). Adding tocilizumab ↑ sustained remission (NEJM 2017;377:317).
[[Polymyalgia rheumatica]]
* Follow clinical status & ESR/CRP; ~⅓relapse over 2 y (J Rheum 2015;42:1213)
