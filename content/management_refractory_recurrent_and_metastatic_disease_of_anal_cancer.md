# management_refractory_recurrent_and_metastatic_disease_of_anal_cancer

- Confirm progression w/ bx & restaging CT or MRI, consider PET
- If locally progressive, proceed to salvage APR (removal of anus, rectum, partial sigmoid, regional nodes) w/ colostomy (Ann Surg Oncol 2007;14:478)
- For unresectable or metastatic, 1st-line standard Rx includes carbo/paclitaxel (preferred), FOLFCIS, FOLFOX, 5-FU + cis, modified DCF. 2nd line includes nivolumab & pembrolizumab. Modification to dose & schedule may be necessary
- No evidence exists to support metastasectomy in anal CA. Regional Rx in select pts w/ limited dz
- Clinical trial preferred
