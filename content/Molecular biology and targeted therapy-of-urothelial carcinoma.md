# Molecular biology and targeted therapy-of-urothelial carcinoma

FGFR2/3 alterations are only genomic markers currently targeted in clinical practice (NEJM 2019;381:338)
TCGA found frequent mut in potential therapeutic targets: 42% in PI3K/AKT/mTOR, 45% in RTK/MAPK pathway, incl. FGFR3 & ERBB2 (Nature 2014;507:315). RNA-seq can divide tumors into different subtypes based on expression: Luminal, luminal-papillary, luminal-infiltrated, basal-squamous, & neuronal (Cell 2017;171(3):540)
Potential predictive biomarkers: DNA-damage repair mts (eg, ERCC2) predict response to platinum (Cancer Discov 2014;4:1140; Eur Urol 2015;68:959; JCO 2018;36:1949) & to anti-PD-1/L1 (JCO 2018;36:1685). Luminal-infiltrated subtype appears more chemoresistant (Cancer Cell 2014;25:152) but sensitive to anti-PD-(L)1 (Lancet 2016;387:1909). TGFÎ² may mediate resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 (Nature 2018;554:544). Data on predictive value of PD-L1 expression are mixed
