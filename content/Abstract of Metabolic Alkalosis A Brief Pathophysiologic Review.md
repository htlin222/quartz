# Abstract of Metabolic Alkalosis A Brief Pathophysiologic Review

Metabolic alkalosis is a very commonly encountered acid-base disorder that may be generated by a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous, pathophysiologic mechanisms. Multiple mechanisms are also responsible for the persistence, or maintenance, of metabolic alkalosis. Understanding these generation and maintenance mechanisms helps direct appropriate intervention and correction of this disorder. The framework utilized in this review is based on the ECF volume-centered approach popularized by Donald Seldin and Floyd Rector in the 1970s.  Although many subsequent scientific discoveries have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis, that framework continues to be a valuable and relatively straightforward diagnostic and therapeutic model.

## Explain by ChatGPT



- **ECF volume:** Metabolic alkalosis is a very commonly encountered acid-base disorder that may be generated by a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous, pathophysiologic mechanisms. Multiple mechanisms are also responsible for the persistence, or maintenance, of metabolic alkalosis.
- **Pathophysiology:** The framework utilized in this review is based on the ECF volume-centered approach popularized by Donald Seldin and Floyd Rector in the 1970s. Although many subsequent scientific discoveries have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis, that framework continues to be a valuable and relatively straightforward diagnostic and therapeutic model.

- **ECF 卷：** 代謝性鹼中毒是一種非常常見的酸鹼失調，可能由多種外源性和/或內源性病理生理機制引起。多種機制也導致代謝性鹼中毒的持續或維持。
- **病理生理學：**本綜述中使用的框架基於 Donald Seldin 和 Floyd Rector 在 1970 年代推廣的以 ECF 容量為中心的方法。儘管隨後的許多科學發現提高了我們對代謝性鹼中毒病理生理學的理解，但該框架仍然是一種有價值且相對簡單的診斷和治療模型。
