# Hyponatremia checklist

- Repeat BMP to verify hyponatremia.
- Check serum glucose to exclude hyperglycemia.
- Calculate corrected sodium for hyperglycemia.
- Consider emergent treatment with 3% IV NaCl for:
  - Severely symptomatic hyponatremia
  - Symptomatic acute hyponatremia or acute sodium decrease of > 10mEq/L
  - Known or suspected intracranial pathology or â†‘ ICP
- Check serum osmolality.
- Check urine osmolality and electrolytes.
- Estimate volume status.
- Consider further diagnostics for hyponatremia based on serum osmolality.
- Stop administration of free water (IV or PO).
- Consider hypertonic saline and/or cause-specific treatment of hyponatremia.
- Check serum sodium frequently during correction with 3% NaCl.
- Monitor urine output for excessive diuresis.
- Begin management of sodium overcorrection if necessary.
