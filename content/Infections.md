### Infections

**Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI)**

â€¢Â Â Â Pathogens:

-Â Â Â Typically skin flora with coagulase-negative staph, *S. aureus*, enterococci. Infections with Gram-negative organisms (*E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Pseudomonas*) less common

-Â Â Â Often infection from skin colonization but can be from hematogenous spread from bloodstream infection occurring from another, distant focus

â€¢Â Â Â Risk factors: Duration of use, catheter material, insertion conditions, site care, placement site (subclavian < internal jugular â‰¤ femoral), host immunodeficiency

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical importance: Nosocomial infection associated with higher morbidity and mortality

â€¢Â Â Â Management: Empiric systemic antibiotics, catheter removal. May need ID consultation depending on the organism/clinical situation.

##### Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI)

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Culture growth of â‰¥1000 CFU/mL with symptoms compatible with UTI in a patient with an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter OR in a patient who had catheter (including condom catheters) removed within the past 48 hours

â€¢Â Â Â Risk factors: Duration of catheterization, female sex, older age, DM, factors related to catheter insertion and care

â€¢Â Â Â Pathogens: *E. coli, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Candida*

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Antibiotic selection based on risk factors for multi-drug resistant organisms and prior culture data. Obtain cultures prior to antibiotics if possible and narrow antibiotics based on sensitivities. Typical antibiotic duration 7â€“14 days. Replace or remove catheter.

##### ***Clostridium difficile***

â€¢Â Â Â Microbiology: Caused by spore-forming and toxin-producing Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium. Typically presents with diarrhea (â‰¥3 stools in 24 hours). Can also cause more severe, fulminant disease with shock and toxic megacolon

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis and Treatment: See Infectious Diseases Chapter 8

##### Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Pneumonia diagnosed >48 hours after intubation

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis and treatment: See Infectious Diseases Chapter 8
