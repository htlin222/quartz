# Biochemical recurrence of mPCa

## Definition

- Rising PSA after definitive RP: Undetectable PSA after RP w/ subsequent detectable PSA (‚â•0.2 ng/mL) that is ‚Üí confirmed on at ‚Ü£ least 2 subsequent determinations (J Urol 2007;177(2):540)
- Rising PSA after definitive RT: Rise of PSA by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2006;65(4):965). Usually confirmed to r/o ‚ÄúPSA Bounce.‚Äù Nadir may take up to 18 mos post RT to achieve

## Workup

- Evaluate risk of metastases or death: Higher risk for PSA doubling time (‚â§12 mos), Gleason score (‚â•8), time to biochemical failure ‚â§18 mos post RT (Eur Urol 2019;75(6):896). Consider age, life expectancy, comorbidities
- R/o local recurrence, regional (pelvic LNs most common) or distant metastases (bone most common). Bone scan, CT/MRI/TRUS, C11-Choline PET, prostate bx
- Local recurrence may be detected by MRI: Post RT-aim to bx, if possible. Post RP-role of bx controversial
- Difficult to detect distant dz w/ CT/Bone Scan at ‚Ü£ PSA <10 ng/mL. If high suspicion & pt a candidate for salvage therapy, consider 68Ga/18F-PSMA PET/CT or 18F-Fluciclovine from PSA ‚â•0.5 ng/mL, if available

## Management

- BCR post RP
- If no distant mets: Consider salvage RT to prostate bed ¬± pelvic LN radiation ¬± ADT
- If not fit for salvage RT: ADT or observation, consider intermittent ADT
- BCR post RT
- Local tx options: RP, cryosurgery, high-intensity focused U/S, brachytherapy ¬± ADT
- Candidate for salvage surgery if original T1-T2, NX or N0, life expectancy >10 y, current PSA <10 ng/mL
- If no distant mets identified, prostate bx neg, or not candidate for salvage: Observation vs. ADT, consider intermittent ADT
