## INTRODUCTION



This chapter will focus on general outpatient medicine, acknowledging that a whole textbook could be dedicated to this subject alone. We will focus on key symptoms and chief complaints encountered in the outpatient setting, as well as health care maintenance pearls. We have omitted the “Anatomy and Physiology” and “Diagnostics” sections because these concepts are covered in the organ system-based chapters and/or embedded throughout the topics in this chapter.
