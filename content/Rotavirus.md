# Rotavirus
Transmitted via fecal-oral route with an incubation period of <48 hours. Most commonly infects young children or those with a sick household contact. The virus activates the enteric nervous system, releases direct enterotoxin, and destroys patches of the brush border (resulting in osmotic diarrhea). Classically presents with diarrhea, vomiting. Treatment: Self limited, provide support/rehydration.
