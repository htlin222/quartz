# Infectious Diseases - Opportunistic Infections - Fast Facts | NEJM Resident 360
Opportunistic infection refers to illness caused by a microorganism that does not usually cause disease in immunocompetent individuals but is pathogenic in those with comprised immune systems.

A variety of immunocompromised patients are at risk for opportunistic infections (OIs), including patients with HIV/AIDS, patients who have undergone solid-organ or bone-marrow transplantation, and those taking high-dose glucocorticoids or immune modulators (e.g., for rheumatologic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and obstructive airway diseases). Recognizing opportunistic infections early and ensuring adequate prophylaxis are crucial for mitigating their complications. In this section, we will cover:

*   Common Opportunistic Infections
    
*   Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults
    
*   Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections after Solid-Organ Transplantation  
      
    

## Common Opportunistic Infections

Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for common infections in addition to the rarer pathogens. The specific organisms that a patient is susceptible to vary based on the patient’s underlying illness. Common opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients include:

*   *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PJP), formerly known as *Pneumocystis carinii* pneumonia (PCP)
    
*   toxoplasmosis
    
*   tuberculosis (TB)
    
*   *Mycobacterium avium*complex(MAC)
    
*   endemic mycoses: histoplasmosis, *Coccidioides*, *Blastomyces*, *Cryptococcus*, *Talaromyces marneffei*(endemic in Southeast Asia)
    
*   other fungal infections: yeast (e.g., *Candida*) and molds (e.g., *Aspergillus* or mucormycosis)
    
*   cytomegalovirus (CMV)
    
*   herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella–zoster virus (VZV)
    
*   Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)
    
*   BK virus
    
*   JC virus
    
*   hepatitis B reactivation  
      
    

## Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults

### Prophylactic Antibiotics

Antiretroviral agents and prophylactic antibiotics have significantly reduced the frequency of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDS. A patient’s CD4 cell count correlates with the likelihood of contracting an OI, and those with normal CD4 counts are not typically considered to be immunocompromised. The following table provides a simple guide for choosing prophylaxis in patient with HIV/AIDS:

**Vaccinations**

In addition to prophylaxis with drugs, vaccination is another vital component for keeping patients with HIV/AIDS healthy. The following table summarizes general immunization recommendations from the CDC for patients with HIV. Other vaccines may be indicated based on additional risk factors. The complete National Institutes of Health recommendations for prophylaxis, treatment, and vaccination of patients with HIV/AIDS can be found here.

| Recommended Vaccination for Patients with HIV |
| --- |
| Influenza | 1 dose annually (live attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV] not recommended) |
| Pneumococcal disease | Either 1 dose of PCV15 followed by a dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), OR a single dose of PCV20* |
| PPSV23 | 1, 2, or 3 doses depending on age and indication |
| Tdap | 1 dose Tdap, Td booster every 10 years |
| MMR | Not recommended if CD4 count <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> | 1 or 2 doses if CD4 count ≥200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> |
| Varicella | Not recommended if if CD4 count <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> | 2 doses if CD4 count ≥200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> |
| HPV | 3 doses through age 26 years |
| Hepatitis B  
Hepatitis A | 2 or 3 doses depending on vaccine |
| MenACWY | 1 or 2 doses depending on indication |
| COVID-19 | May receive 1 dose of J&J/Janssen vaccine or 2 doses of mRNA-based vaccines  
  
If poorly controlled HIV (CD4 cell count <200, CD4% <14) or untreated HIV who received 2 doses of mRNA-based vaccines previously should receive a 3<sup>rd</sup> dose of vaccine at least 28 days after their 2nd dose.  
  
Individuals with well-controlled HIV may receive a booster 6 months after completion of the initial series of COVID vaccination |

## Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections after Solid-Organ Transplantation

The following table summarizes recommendations for prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected solid-organ transplant recipients.

  
**(Source: Infections in Solid Organ Transplant HIV-Infected Patients. Clin Microbiol Infect 2014.)**

Initial considerations for infection and prophylaxis should be started at time of transplantation. The following are prophylaxis recommendations for solid-organ transplant recipients from the American Society of Transplantation infectious diseases guidelines.

*   **Valganciclovir** is recommended for CMV prophylaxis in the following patients (“D” denotes donor serologic status and “R” denotes recipient serologic status): D+/R−, D+/R+, and D−/R+. Duration of prophylaxis varies by organ transplantation center and risk of developing CMV infection and is usually a minimum of 3 months (but often closer to 6 or 12 months) after transplantation and restarted for a few months after postrejection treatment with antithymocyte globulin.
    
*   **TMP-SMX** is typically administered for 6 to 12 months after transplantation, to prevent PJP pneumonia as well toxoplasmosis. Alternative PJP prophylaxis agents include dapsone, atovaquone, or inhaled pentamidine.
    
*   **Oral clotrimazole lozenges, nystatin, or fluconazole** are given as needed after transplantation or a month after antithymocyte globulin.
