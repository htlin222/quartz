# Diagnostic studies-constrictive pericarditis

- ECG: nonspecific, AF common (up to 33%) in advanced cases
- ECG findings Of PERICARDITIS
  1. Widespread concave ST elevation
     - No convex or horizontal ST elevation
     - ST elevation in II > III
  2. Widespread PR depression
  3. STdepression and PR elevation in aVR + V1
     - No ST depression in any lead other than avR or v1
  4. Spodick's sign positive
     - downsloping of TP segment

- CXR: calcification (MTb most common), espec in lateral view (although not specific)
- Echocardiogram: ± thickened pericardium, “septal bounce” = abrupt displacement of septum during rapid filling in early diastole
- Cardiac catheterization:
  - atria w/ Ms or Ws (prominent x and y descents)
  - ventricles: dip-and-plateau or square-root sign (rapid ↓ pressure at onset of diastole, rapid ↑ to early plateau)
    discordance between LV & RV pressure peaks during respiratory cycle (Circ 1996;93:2007)
- 心導管的壓力評估非常關鍵！
  - RA and LA filling pressures ↑
  - Atrial pressure (想像一下頸靜脈波形)：M or W waveform（就是很明顯 的 x & y descents).
  - Ventricle pressure: Dip-and-plateau sign or NB:square root pattern.
- CT or MRI: thickened pericardium (>4 mm; Se ~80%) w/ tethering (Circ 2011;123:e418)
