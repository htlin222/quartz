### Hemoglobin Targets in Patients with CKD

â€¢Â Â Â **TREAT.** *N Eng J Med* 2009;361(21):2019â€“2032.

-Â Â Â Multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that randomized patients with CKD, DM2, and anemia to receive darbepoetin or placebo. The darbepoetin group received therapy to maintain a Hg >13 g/dL, while the placebo group received rescue darbepoetin if hemoglobin fell below 9 g/dL. Targeting a hemoglobin of >13 g/dL with the use of erythrocyte-stimulating agents did not confer a survival benefit, but was associated with increased risk of stroke.
