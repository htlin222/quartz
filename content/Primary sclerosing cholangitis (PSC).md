# Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)

(NEJM 2016;375:1161; Clin Liver Dis 2020;15:125)

- Diffuse inflammation of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts leading to fibrosis & stricturing of biliary system. A/w HLA-B8 and -DR3 or -DR4, frequent ⊕ autoantibodies.

- Epi:

  - ♂ >♀ (20-50 y) ~70% Pts w/ PSC have IBD (usually UC);
  - only 1-4% w/ UC have PSC. ⊕ prognostic factors: ♂, absence of IBD, small duct PSC (Gastro 2017;152:1829).

- Symptoms:

  - fatigue,
  - pruritus,
  - [[jaundice]],
  - fevers,
  - RUQ pain,
  - Diarrhea → ❓ [[IBD]]: 🔎 Diagnosis: check colonoscope
  - 50% of Pts asymptomatic

- Ddx:

  - 👉 [[Extrahepatic cholestasis]]
  - [[PBC]]
  - overlap w/ [[AIH]],
  - IgG4 autoimmune cholangitis,

- Dx:

  - cholangiography (MRCP ± ERCP) → multifocal beaded bile duct strictures
  - exclude 2° cause
  - 一種自身抗體，即核週抗中性粒細胞胞漿抗體 (pANCA)，在約 65% 的 PSC 患者中呈陽性。
  - 60% 至 80% 的 PSC 有潰瘍性結腸炎 (UC)；因此，建議在診斷時進行結腸鏡檢查。
  - may miss dx if confined to small intrahepatic ducts (“small duct PSC”).
  - Liver bx if unclear: [[onion-skin fibrosis]] around bile ducts + some findings similar to PBC.
