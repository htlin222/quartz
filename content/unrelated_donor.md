# unrelated_donor

- BM or PBSC from URDs identified through NMDP

## Advantages

- W/ improved HLA typing, outcomes w/ 8/8-matched URD have become closer to those w/ MRD (eg, Leukemia 2010;24:1276)

## Disadvantages

- Higher GVHD vs. related, especially if mismatch
- Longer process of procuring graft
- Likelihood of matched URD highly dependent on race (NEJM 2014;371:339)
