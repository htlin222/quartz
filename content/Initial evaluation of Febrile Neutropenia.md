# Initial evaluation of Febrile Neutropenia

- complete history and physicalÂ are crucial to identify a focus of infection
- laboratory tests: complete blood count with differential, electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver function tests, and lactate
- routine blood cultures: at â†£ least two sets, if the patient has a central venous catheter, one set from the catheter and one peripheral
- urinalysis and urine culture
- chest radiograph: in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms
- symptom-directed workup:Â cultures from any other sites of suspected infection
  - e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, wounds, lower respiratory tract
  - and/or imaging (e.g., abdominal and pelvic CT in patients with GI symptoms
- viral nasopharyngeal swabs: in patients presenting with flu-like illness
