# Diagnostic studies-diabetic ketoacidosis

*   ↑ Anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH <7.3 & HCO3 <18): can later develop nonanion gap acidosis due to urinary loss of ketones (HCO3 equiv.) & fluid resuscitation w/ chloride
*   Ketosis: ⊕ urine and serum ketones (predominant ketone is β-OH-butyrate, but acetoacetate measured by assay; urine ketones may be ⊕ in fasting normal Pts)
*   ↑ Serum glc usually >250 mg/dL (but can be euglycemic if on SGLT-2i);↑ BUN & Cr
*   Hyponatremia: corrected Na = measured Na + [2.4 × (measured glc – 100)/100]
*   ↓ or ↑ K (but even if serum K is elevated, usually total body K depleted); ↓ total body phos
*   Leukocytosis & ↑ **amylase** (even if no pancreatitis)

[Nonspecific hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: incidence and correlation with biochemical abnormalities - PubMed][1]

> Conclusions: In DKA nonspecific elevations of amylase and lipase occur in 16-25% of cases. Amylase elevation is **correlated with pH and serum osmolality**, but lipase elevation is correlated with serum osmolality alone. Diagnosis of AP based soley on elevated amylase or lipase, even > 3 times normal, is not justifiable.

## Explain by ChatGPT

*   Anion gap metabolic acidosis is when the pH is less than 7.3 and the HCO3 is **less than 18**. This can **later develop into nonanion gap acidosis** due to **urinary loss of ketones** and **fluid resuscitation with chloride**.
*   Ketosis is when there are ketones in the urine and serum. The predominant ketone is **β-OH-butyrate**, but **acetoacetate** is measured by assay. Urine ketones may be positive in fasting normal patients.
*   The serum glucose is usually increased. [[hyponatremia]] is when the corrected Na is measured **Na + [2.4 x (measured glucose - 100)/100]** 每一百上升2.4

> 200(+100) --> +2.4
> 500(+400) --> +9.6

*   Potassium may be decreased or increased (but even if the serum potassium is elevated, usually the total body potassium is depleted). Phosphorus is decreased.
*   Leukocytosis and amylase are increased (even if there is no pancreatitis).

## 窩的英文不太好

*   陰離子間隙代謝性酸中毒是指 pH 值低於 7.3 且 HCO3 低於 18。由於尿中酮體丟失和氯離子液體復甦，這會在以後發展為非陰離子間隙酸中毒。
*   酮症是指尿液和血清中含有酮體。主要的酮是 β-OH-丁酸，但乙酰乙酸是通過測定法測量的。空腹正常患者尿酮體可能呈陽性。
*   血糖通常會升高。低鈉血症是當校正的 Na 測量為 Na + [2.4 x（測量的葡萄糖 - 100）/100] 時。
*   鉀可能會減少或增加（但即使血清鉀升高，通常全身鉀也會耗盡）。磷減少。
*   白細胞增多和澱粉酶升高（即使沒有胰腺炎）。
