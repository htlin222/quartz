**Title**

### Daratumumab Plus VRd in Transplantation-Eligible Patients with Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma

**Information**

- **Design**: Phase 3, randomized, controlled, multi-center
- **Number of patients**: 709
- **Patients characteristics**: Transplantation-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
- **Agent**: Subcutaneous daratumumab combined with [[bortezomib.md|bortezomib]], lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (D-VRd) vs VRd alone
- **Treatment line**: First-line therapy
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: PERSEUS (NCT03710603, EudraCT 2018-002992-16)

**Comparison of two groups**

| Endpoint                                       | D-VRd                                | VRd            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Progression-Free Survival at 48 months         | 84.3%                                | 67.7%          |
| Hazard Ratio for Disease Progression or Death  | 0.42 (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.59); P<0.001 | -              |
| Complete Response or Better                    | 87.9%                                | 70.1%; P<0.001 |
| Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)–Negative Status | 75.2%                                | 47.5%; P<0.001 |

**Other findings**

- Death occurred in 34 patients in the D-VRd group and 44 patients in the VRd group
- Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in most patients in both groups, with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia being the most common
- Serious adverse events occurred in 57.0% of patients in the D-VRd group and 49.3% of those in the VRd group

**Summary**
In this phase 3 trial, the addition of subcutaneous daratumumab to VRd induction and consolidation therapy and to lenalidomide maintenance therapy significantly improved progression-free survival among transplantation-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The D-VRd group also had higher rates of complete response or better and MRD-negative status compared to the VRd group.
