# inflammatory breast cancer

[[peau d orange]]

Definition: a rare form  of advanced, aggressive invasive carcinoma characterized by dermal lymphatic invasion of tumor cells

## Clinical features

- Peau d'orange
- Erythematous, warm, and edematous skin plaques with prominent hair follicles that resemble orange peel
- Caused by obstruction of the lymphatic channels due to tumor growth
- Tenderness, burning sensation
- Blood-tinged nipple discharge
- Signs of metastatic disease (e.g., axillary lymphadenopathy)  [16]
- Usually no palpable mass

## Diagnostics: based on clinical features and biopsy [17]

- Diagnostic criteria (all must be met)
  - Rapid onset of breast erythema, edema, warmth, and peau d'orange, with or without palpable mass on breast examination
  - Erythema involving at least one-third of the breast
  - Symptoms have been present for < 6 months
  - Core needle biopsy confirming the presence of invasive carcinoma
  - Skin punch biopsy: patients who meet the diagnostic criteria should undergo at least two full-thickness skin punch biopsies
- Further testing
  - Imaging: bilateral mammogram and ultrasound of regional lymph node
  - Receptor and HER2 gene testing

## Differential diagnosis

- Mastitis
- Paget disease of the breast
- Breast abscess

## Treatment

- chemotherapy (possibly in combination with targeted therapy) PLUS radiation PLUS modified radical mastectomy
- Prognosis: 5-year survival rate is âˆ¼ 40%.
