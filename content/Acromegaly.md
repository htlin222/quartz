# Acromegaly

(↑ GH; 10% of adenomas; Nat Rev Dis Primer 2019;5:1)

- Physiology:
  - stimulates secretion of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1)
- [[Clinical manifestations of Acromegaly]] 󰒗
- Diagnostic studies:
  - low utility in checking random GH levels because of pulsatile secretion
  - ↑ IGF-1 (somatomedin C); ± ↑ PRL; OGTT → GH not suppressed to <1 (<0.3 if newer assay) ng/mL; pituitary MRI to evaluate for tumor
- Treatment:
- [[Management of acromegaly]]
  - [[surgery of acromegaly]]
  - **octreotide** (long- and short-acting preparations),
  - dopamine agonists (if PRL cosecretion),
  - pegvisomant (GH receptor antagonist),
  - radiation
- Prognosis:
  - w/ and w/o Rx ↑ mortality, risk of
    - pituitary insufficiency,
    - [[colorectal cancer]]
