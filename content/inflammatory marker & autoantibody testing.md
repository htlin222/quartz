# inflammatory marker & autoantibody testing

Inflammatory markers (Mod Rheumatol 2009;19:469; NEJM 1999;340:448)

- ESR:
  - indirect measure of inflammation [‚Üë RBC aggregation due to acute-phase proteins (fibrinogen, Ig)];
  - slow to rise;
  - may ‚Üë w/ age, preg., anemia, obesity, ESRD. Ddx for >100: malig. esp. MM, lymphoma;
  - GCA or other vasculitis;
  - endocarditis, TB, osteomyelitis.
- CRP: direct measure of inflammation (protein produced by liver, part of innate immune system); typically rises and falls before the ESR w/ treatment/resolution of process

## Autoantibody testing (Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol 2014;28:907)

- ANA (anti-nuclear Ab): screening
  - test for Ab directed against nuclear proteins.
- Order ANA only when clinical suspicion for CTD b/c nonspecific:
  - 1:40 (very low ‚äï, 25-30% of healthy Pts);
  - 1:80 (low ‚äï, 10-15% of healthy Pts);
  - ‚â•1:160 (‚äï, 5% of healthy Pts). May be ‚äï in Pts prior to clin manifest (NEJM 2003;349:1526;
  - Arthritis Res Ther 2011;13:1).
- If ANA ‚äï and high clinical suspicion for CTD, consider testing for Ab against dsDNA, Smith, Ro/La, RNP, Scl-70 and myositis-specific Abs (highly specific for various CTD)
- ANA does _not_ correlate well w/ disease activity, ‚à¥ no clinical value in serial testing
- ANA also ‚äï in:
  - AIH,
  - PBC,
  - thyroid disease,
  - certain infxns and malignancies,
  - IBD,
  - IPF
- RF and anti-CCP (see ‚ÄúRheumatoid Arthritis‚Äù)
