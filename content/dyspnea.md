Pleural disease: large effusion, fibrosis, pneumothorax
Chest wall/diaphragm: kyphoscoliosis, ↑ abd girth
Neuromuscular disorders (ALS, GBS, MG)
Hyperinflation (COPD, asthma)

## Stimulation of receptors

Chemoreceptors: hypoxemia, metabolic acidosis
Mechanoreceptors: ILD, pulmonary edema, PHT, PE

## ↓ O2 carrying cap. (but nl PaO2)
