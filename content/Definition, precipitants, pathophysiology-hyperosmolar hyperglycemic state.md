# Definition, precipitants, pathophysiology-hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state


(Med Clin North Am 2017;101:587)
* Extreme hyperglycemia (w/o ketoacidosis) + hyperosm. + Δ MS in T2D (typically elderly)
* Precip same as for DKA, but also include dehydration and renal failure
* Hyperglycemia → osmotic diuresis → vol depletion → prerenal azotemia → ↑ glc, etc.
