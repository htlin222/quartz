# Metabolic Alkalosis—Source of Excess HCO3−

Usually metabolic alkalosis indicates an accumulation of “excess” HCO3−. The source of excess HCO3− can be exogenous, endogenous, or both. Exogenous sources are Na+ or K+ HCO3− salts or salts of precursors (organic anions such as lactate, acetate or citrate, which generate HCO3− when completely oxidized). These salts can be ingested/absorbed or infused (Table 1).

The two potential endogenous sources of large amounts of HCO3− are (*1*) the stomach and (*2*) the kidneys. Net endogenous HCO3− generation requires H+ removal from the body. HCO3− is generated when HCl is secreted into gastric lumen, but net HCO3− accumulation in the ECF requires the HCl to be lost externally, usually as a result of vomiting and/or suction (see section on gastric alkalosis).

Normally, kidney H+ excretion into the urine (as NH4+ and/or titratable acid) generates HCO3− to replace the quantity decomposed by nonvolatile H+ derived from dietary intake and metabolism and any HCO3− lost in alkaline stool. To the extent kidney HCO3− generation exceeds this requirement, “excess” HCO3−is generated. This generally occurs when the following conditions coexist: (*1*) the kidney tubules/ducts beyond the early distal tubule are avidly reabsorbing Na+ (for example, aldosterone activity is high), and (*2*) the delivery of salt and volume to these sites is relatively large.

Clinical examples of kidney bicarbonate overproduction are:

1.  Primary hyperaldosteronism (especially when a high-salt diet is ingested) and other mimics of primary hyperaldosteronism (Table 2).

2.  Loop and/or thiazide diuretics and several inherited syndromes that have diuretic like manifestations (*i.e.*, Bartter and Gitelman syndromes).

3.  The infusion of Na+ salts of poorly absorbed anions (PO4, SO4, penicillin, *etc.*) if distal tubule Na+ reabsorption is stimulated by mineralocorticoids and/or volume contraction (19,20).


Another endogenous source of HCO3− is the movement of K+ from within cells into the ECF. In response to hypokalemia, K+  exit is partially balanced by movement of H+ into cells and this generates ECF HCO3− (21,22). ECF [HCO3−] can also increase when the ECF volume contracts around a fixed quantity of HCO3− (23) (see section on gastric alkalosis).



## Explain by ChatGPT

- **Exogenous sources of metabolic alkalosis** : (sodium and potassium bicarbonate salts, or organic anion precursors);
- **Endogenous sources of metabolic alkalosis** : (stomach and kidneys);
- **Primary hyperaldosteronism** : (a condition where aldosterone activity is high, leading to increased sodium reabsorption in the kidney tubules);
- **Loop and thiazide diuretics** : (drugs that increase urine output and can lead to metabolic alkalosis);
- **Hypokalemia** : (low potassium levels in the blood, which can lead to HCO3- accumulation in the ECF)
