# Stepwise Evaluation of a Patient with Delirium

from Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 21e

## Initial Evaluation
- History with special attention to medications (including over-the-counter and herbals)
- General physical examination and neurologic examination
- Complete blood count
- Electrolyte panel including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus
- Liver function tests, including albumin
- Renal function tests
 
## First-Tier Further Evaluation Guided by Initial Evaluation
Systemic infection screen
	- Urinalysis and culture
	- Chest radiograph
	- Blood cultures
Electrocardiogram
Arterial blood gas
Serum and/or urine toxicology screen (perform earlier in young persons)
Brain imaging with MRI with diffusion and gadolinium (preferred) or CT
Suspected CNS infection or other inflammatory disorder: [[lumbar puncture after brain imaging]]
Suspected seizure-related etiology: electroencephalogram (EEG) (if high suspicion, should be performed immediately)

## Second-Tier Further Evaluation
- Vitamin levels: B12, folate, thiamine
- thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4; cortisol
- Serum ammonia
- Sedimentation rate
- antinuclear antibodies (ANA), complement levels; p-ANCA, c-ANCA, consider paraneoplastic/autoimmune encephalitis serologies
- rapid plasmin reagin (RPR); fungal and viral serologies if high suspicion; HIV antibody

Lumbar puncture (if not already performed)
Brain MRI with and without gadolinium (if not already performed)
