# transplantation procedure (for Allo HSCT)

## Pre-Tx conditioning regimen goal:
immunosuppression to allow donor cell engraftment & anti-tumor efficacy to ↓ relapse risk. Type and dose of agents determine this balance.

## Myeloablative conditioning:

### high-dose chemo and/or total body irradiation.
* Low relapse rates,
* high immunosuppression,
* higher transplant-related morbidity.

### Reduced-intensity conditioning (“RIC”):

* lower dose of chemo →
	* ↓ transplant-related morbidity/mortality,
	* but ↑ relapse b/c it relies more on GVT effect
	* (Blood 2015;126:23).
* Allows allo HSCT
	* for older adults (>60) or
	* Pts w/ comorbidities.

## Sources of hematopoietic stem cells (NEJM 2012;367:1487)

### Bone marrow (BM):
* original source
* preferred in non-malignant disease,
* ↓ GVHD rates

### Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC):
* easier to collect
* more commonly used
* BM vs. PBSC ≈ survival
* BM ↓ chronic GVHD, PBSC ↓ graft failure
* faster engraftment

### Umbilical cord blood stem cells (UCB): see above in Types of Allo HSCT

## Engraftment:
* (ANC) recovers to 500/µL w/in
	* 2 wk w/ PBSC
	* 2.5 wk w/ BM
	* 4 wk w/ UCB
* G-CSF accelerates recovery by 3–5 d in all scenarios.
