### Cholestatic Liver Diseases

##### Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)

•   Etiology: Immune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, most common in females 40–50 yr

•   Clinical features: Fatigue, pruritus, jaundice

•   Diagnosis: At least two of following: AlkP >1.5× ULN, \+anti-mitochondrial antibody, liver biopsy with destruction of interlobular bile ducts and destructive cholangitis

•   Treatment: First line: ursodiol slows progression. Second line: obeticholic acid in compensated cirrhosis. For advanced disease, liver transplantation.

##### Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)

•   Etiology: Fibroinflammatory disorder of bile ducts, most common in men 20–30 yr. 80% patients have IBD (UC)

•   Clinical features: Patients are usually asymptomatic or may develop pruritus, abdominal pain, cholangitis

•   Diagnosis: MRCP or ERCP: “Beads on a string” of intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts. Liver biopsy: Fibrous obliteration of the small bile ducts with an “onion skin” appearance on pathology

•   Treatment: No effective treatment. Progressive disease that requires liver transplantation. High association with cholangiocarcinoma: Screen with q6–12mo LFTs, Ca19-9, MRCP
