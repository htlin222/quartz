### Cellulitis and Cellulitis Mimickers

â€¢Â Â Â **Effect of dermatology consultation on outcomes for patients with presumed cellulitis.** *JAMA Dermatol* 2018;154(5):529â€“536.

-Â Â Â Randomized clinical trial of 175 hospitalized adults where patients were randomized to intervention (dermatology consult) vs. control (no dermatology consult, standard of care). The length of intravenous antibiotic use was significantly shorter, and the 2-week improvement rate was significantly higher in patients in the intervention group (dermatology consult), suggesting that inpatient dermatology consult may enhance patient outcomes by improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating antibiotic stewardship in hospitalized patients with suspected cellulitis.
