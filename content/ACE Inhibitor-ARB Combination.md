### ACE Inhibitor-ARB Combination

â€¢Â Â Â **VA-NEPHRON D.** *N Eng J Med* 2013;369(20):1892â€“1903.

-Â Â Â Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized patients with diabetes with proteinuria to receive losartan 100 mg PO daily plus either lisinopril 10â€“40 mg PO daily or placebo. The addition of lisinopril to losartan did not prevent kidney function decline but did increase risk of hyperkalemia and AKI compared to losartan plus placebo. The trial was stopped early due to safety concerns.
