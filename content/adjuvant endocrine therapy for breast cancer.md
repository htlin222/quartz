# adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer

[[definition of menopause]]

## Stage I

- T1ab (a.k.a. < 1cm)
  - Premenopause [[Tamoxifen]] x 5 years
  - Postmenopause  AI x 5 years
- T1c (a.k.a. > 1cm)
  - Premenopause Tamoxifen x 5 years ± OFS
    - 如果年紀小於35，則考慮OFS plus AI, Why?
    - [[Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial]] (SOFT) 9成15 對 9成35的 → 歐斯
    - [[Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial]] (TEXT) 歐斯 💥 沒有差
    - 可顯著降低 ↓ 復發風險，但會增加 ↑ 毒性。
  - Considered in high risk group, particularly those warranting chemotherapy
  - Postmenopause  AI x 5 years

## Stage II

- N(-) (a.k.a. > 2cm)
  - Premenopause OFS and AI/tamoxifen
  - Postmenopause  AI x 5 years

- N(+) (a.k.a. N1)
  - Premenopause Extended therapy, [[OFS]] and AI/tamoxifen
  - Postmenopause  Extended therapy

## Stage III

- Extended therapy, OFS and AI/tamoxifen in premonopause
  - 10 years  or 7~8 years

## HIGHER-RISK, HORMONE RECEPTOR-POSITIVE, HER2-NEGATIVE CANCERS

Breast Identification of higher-risk patients and approach
Ovarian suppression plus endocrine therapy
Methods of suppression
Efficacy in high-risk disease
Rationale for OFS
Rationale for AI over tamoxifen, in combination with OFS
Toxicity
Sequencing ovarian suppression with other systemic therapies
Addition of targeted therapies for select, high-risk cancers
Addition of CDK 4/6 inhibitor to adjuvant endocrine therapy in high-risk disease
Olaparib for select high risk, BRCA-mutated cancers
LOW- TO AVERAGE-RISK, HORMONE RECEPTOR-POSITIVE, HER2-NEGATIVE CANCERS
Preference for tamoxifen
Tamoxifen versus OFS plus endocrine therapy
Tamoxifen versus placebo
Transitioning from tamoxifen to an AI after menopause
Risk of ovarian function reactivation on an AI
HORMONE RECEPTOR-POSITIVE, HER2-POSITIVE CANCERS
DURATION OF ENDOCRINE THERAPY
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients who became amenorrheic during chemotherapy
Importance of contraception
[[Fertility preservation]]
