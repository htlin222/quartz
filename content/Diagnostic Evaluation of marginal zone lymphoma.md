# Diagnostic Evaluation of marginal zone lymphoma

## Bx required

Either excisional/incisional or core plus FNA w/ flow cytometry, splenic MZL often diagnosed on splenectomy specimen

## Histology

Polymorphous infiltrate of small lymphocytes, centrocyte-like B cells, & plasma cells; reactive follicles; lymphoepithelial lesions (epithelial tissues)
‚Üí Splenic MZL w/ characteristic villous lymphocytes on peripheral smear

- [[Immunophenotype of marginal zone lymphoma]]
- [[Cytogenetics_FISH of marginal zone lymphoma]]

## Molecular diagnostics for clonal IgH rearrangement (proves malignancy)

- [[Lab evaluation of marginal zone lymphoma]]
- BM aspirate & core bx: Send for flow cytometry, splenic MZL classically shows ‚Äúintrasinusoidal‚Äù lymphocytic infiltrations
- Imaging: CT C/A/P w/ contrast; may need MRI orbits (ocular) or neck (salivary); FDG PET not routinely required
- Special considerations for gastric ENMZL:
  - ‚Üí Endoscopy ¬± EUS w/ core bx required, stain specimen for H. pylori
  - ‚Üí if H. pylori negative by histopath, then perform H. pylori stool Ag test, urea breath test, or H. pylori blood Ab test
