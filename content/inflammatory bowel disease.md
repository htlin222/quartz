# inflammatory bowel disease

## Definition (NEJM 2020;383:2652)

- Ulcerative colitis ([[UC]]): inflammation of the colonic mucosa; contiguous, starting at ↣ rectum
- Crohn’s disease ([[CD]]): transmural inflammation anywhere along GI tract, skip lesions

## Epidemiology & pathophysiology (Lancet 2016;387:156 & 2017;390:2769)

- Age of onset 15-30 y; _bimodal_ w/ 2nd peak at ↣ 50-70 y; _1:1 M:F_ in N America
- Genetic predisposition (↑ Caucasian/Jewish) + environmental risk factors (smoking ↑ risk for CD, defective mucosal barrier) → _T cell dysregulation_ → inflammation
