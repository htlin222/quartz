# Workup-acid-base disturbances

## Traditional or physiologic approach (Brønsted-Lowry definition of acids & bases)

- Determine primary disorder: _✓ pH, PaCO2, HCO3_
- Determine if degree of compensation is appropriate

> Strong ion difference or “Stewart Method” (NEJM 2014;371:1821)

## [[Mixed-disorders]] (more than one primary disorder at the same time)
