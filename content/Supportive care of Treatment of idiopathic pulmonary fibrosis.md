# Supportive care of Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
We offer supportive care (eg, supplemental oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation, and COVID-19, pneumococcal, and seasonal influenza vaccination) and provide information about end-of-life issues and advanced directives to all patients. (See 'General approach' above and 'Supportive care' above.)

We use several preventive measures to reduce the risk of lung injury and consequent acute exacerbations of IPF. These include vaccination against respiratory viruses and infections, early treatment of bacterial or viral pulmonary infection, screening for and treatment of dysphagia and reflux aspiration, and avoidance of mechanical ventilation in elective procedures. (See 'Prevention of pulmonary infections and acute exacerbations' above.)

Palliative measures (eg, facial cooling with a fan, opioids, anxiolytics) may be helpful for patients with refractory dyspnea or cough. Patients with advanced IPF may benefit from palliative care (table 3 and table 4). (See 'Palliative care' above.)
