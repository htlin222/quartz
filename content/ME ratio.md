# ME ratio

- The normal M:E ratio in adults varies from 1.2:1 to 5:1 myeloid cells to nucleated erythroid cells.
- An increased M:E ratio (6:1) may be seen in infection, chronic myelogenous leukemia or erythroid hypoplasia.
- A decreased M:E ratio (<1.2-1) may mean a decrease in granulocytes or an increase in erythroid cells.
