- Consider PAC if not resp to Rx, unsure re:
  - vol status,
  - HoTN,
  - hypoperfusion,
  - need inotropes
- Tailored Rx w/ PAC (qv);
  - goals of MAP >60,
  - CI >2.2 (MVO2 >60%),
  - SVR <800,
  - PCWP <18
- IV vasodilators:
  - NTG,
  - nitroprusside (risk of coronary steal if CAD)
- [[Inotropes]] (properties in addition to ↑ inotropy listed below)
- [[mechanical circulatory support]] (also see “Tailored Therapy;” JACC 2015;65:e7 & 2542)
- Cardiac transplantation:
  - ~2200/yr in U.S. <10% mort. in 1st y,
