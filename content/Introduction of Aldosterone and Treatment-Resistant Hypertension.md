# Introduction of Aldosterone and Treatment-Resistant Hypertension

Aldosterone has long been a pharmacologic target for the treatment of hypertension. Thus, an article by Freeman et al. and an accompanying editorial by Azizi in this issue of the *Journal* are of keen interest. Freeman et al. describe a trial of a new drug called baxdrostat that inhibits aldosterone synthase in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension.
