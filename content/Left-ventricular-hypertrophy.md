> 參考➡️ [AHA/ACCF/HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part V: electrocardiogram changes associated with cardiac …](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circulationaha.108.191097)

* Etiologies: HTN, AS/AI, HCM, coarctation of aorta

* Criteria (all w/ Se <50%, Sp >85%; accuracy affected by age, sex, race, BMI)

Sokolow-Lyon: S in V1 + R in V5 or V6 ≥35 mm or R in aVL ≥11 mm (↓ Se w/ ↑ BMI)

Cornell: R in aVL + S in V3 >28 mm in men or >20 mm in women

Romhilt-Estes point-score system (4 points = probable; 5 points = diagnostic): ↑ volt: limb lead R or S ≥20 mm or S in V1 or V2 ≥30 mm or R in V5 or V6 ≥30 mm (3 pts)

ST displacement opposite to QRS deflection: w/o dig (3 pts); w/ dig (1 pt)

LAA (3 pts); LAD (2 pts); QRS duration ≥90 msec (1 pt)

Intrinsicoid deflection (QRS onset to peak of R) in V5 or V6 ≥50 msec (1 pt)

If LAFB present: S in III + max (R+S) in any lead ≥30 mm in men or ≥28 mm in women
