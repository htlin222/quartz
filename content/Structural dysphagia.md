# Structural dysphagia

(solids >liquids; JAMA 2015;313:18; Gastro 2018;155:1022)

## Oropharyngeal

- [[Zenker’s divertic]].
- Malignancy; proximal strictures/rings/webs; infection; radiation injury; goiter; osteophytes

## Esophageal

- Rings:
  - (intermittent dysphagia, concentric obstructing tissue, _Schatzki ring_): 
  - near GE jxn, a/w food impaction, linked to GERD; 
  - Rx w/ PPI, dilation
- Webs:
  - thin, partially occlusive structure, 
  - proximal, 
  - a/w Fe defic. ([[Plummer-Vinson synd]].)
- Peptic or XRT strictures, foreign body, tumor, vascular rings (dysphagia lusoria), compression from dilated left atrium compression
- Infxn esophagitis: odynophagia > dysphagia; often immunosupp w/ Candida, HSV, CMV
- Pill esophagitis: odynophagia > dysphagia; NSAID, KCl, bisphosp., doxy & tetracycline
- [[Eosinophilic esophagitis]]
- **Esophageal Dysphagia:** The causes of esophageal dysphagia can be categorized as structural disorders or motility disorders.

- **Structural disorders** include the following:
  - intrinsic esophageal obstruction
    - strictures related to esophagitis or malignancy
  - extrinsic esophageal stricture
    - vascular anomaly
    - malignancy/mass in chest or mediastinum
  - esophageal rings and webs
    - Plummer–Vinson syndrome (esophageal ring)
    - Schatzki ring
  - food impaction
- **Motility disorders** can be categorized as primary and secondary esophageal motility disorders as defined in the following table.
