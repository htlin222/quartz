# hepatitis C virus Treatment indications

(<www.hcvguidelines.org>) (Lancet 2019;393:1453; Hepatology 2020;71:686)

## Acute: if no spont. clearance at ↣ 12-16 wk, can Rx w/ same regimens for chronic HCV

Chronic: ↓ HCC & mortality. Recommended for all except if ↓ life expectancy.
Here is the information as a Markdown outline:

- **Potency**

  - Protease inhibitors: High (varies by HCV genotype)
  - Nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors: Moderate-to-high (consistent across HCV genotypes and subtypes)
  - Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors: Varies by HCV genotype
  - NS5A inhibitors: High (against multiple HCV genotypes)

- **Barrier to resistance**

  - Protease inhibitors: Low (1a <1b)
  - Nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors: High (1a = 1b)
  - Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors: Very low (1a <1b)
  - NS5A inhibitors: Low (1a <1b)

- **Potential for drug interactions**

  - Protease inhibitors: High
  - Nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors: Low
  - Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors: Variable
  - NS5A inhibitors: Low-to-moderate

- **Toxicity**

  - Protease inhibitors: Rash, anemia, ↑ bilirubin
  - Nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors: Mitochondrial toxicity, interactions with HIV antiretrovirals (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and ribavirin\*
  - Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors: Variable
  - NS5A inhibitors: Variable

- **Dosing**

  - Protease inhibitors: daily to three times daily
  - Nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors: daily to twice daily
  - Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors: daily to three times daily
  - NS5A inhibitors: daily

- **Comments**
  - Protease inhibitors: Later generation protease inhibitors are expected to have higher barriers to resistance and be pan-genotype
  - Nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors: Single target for binding at the active site
  - Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors: Many targets for binding at allosteric sites
