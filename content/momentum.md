MOMENTUM: Phase 3 randomized study of momelotinib (MMB) versus danazol (DAN) in symptomatic and anemic myelofibrosis (MF) patients previously treated with a JAK inhibitor.

- TLDR: MMB good for thrombocytopenia 20k is ok, and is good for anemia

- Design: Phase 3 randomized multi-center trial
- Number of patients: 195 patients received MMB and 65 patients received DAN
- Patients characteristics: Primary or post-ET/PV MF; DIPSS high risk, Int-2, or Int-1; MF Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score (MFSAF TSS) â‰¥10; Hgb <10 g/dL; prior JAKi for â‰¥90 days, or â‰¥28 days if RBC transfusions â‰¥4 units in 8 wks or Gr 3/4 thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hematoma; palpable spleen â‰¥5 cm
- Agent: MMB (200 mg QD) vs DAN (600 mg QD)
- Treatment line: Previously treated with a JAK inhibitor
- Trial Acronym or NCTId Number: NCT04173494
- Compare efficacy:

| Parameter                         | Result             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| TSS response rate at 24 weeks     | MMB: 72% DAN: 58%  |
| RBC transfusion independence rate | MMB: 13% DAN: 15%  |
| Splenic response rate             | MMB: 22% DAN: 12%  |
| HR for OS at 24 weeks             | HR=0.506, p=0.0719 |

- Highlight of toxicity: Most common Grade â‰¥3 adverse events were thrombocytopenia and anemia, with similar rates between MMB and DAN. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in a small percentage of patients with MMB.
- One line summary: MMB showed superior efficacy in symptom responses, transfusion requirements, and spleen responses compared to DAN with comparable safety, offering a potential treatment option for MF patients with anemia.
