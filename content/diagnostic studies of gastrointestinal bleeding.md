## UGIB:
* EGD w/in 24 h (NEJM 2020;382:1299).
* If severe bleed, ‚Üë dx/Rx yield if **erythro 250 mg IV** given **30 min** prior to endoscopy to **clear stomach contents**.

## LGIB:
* colonoscopy (identifies cause in >70%); early colo (w/in 24 h) unlikely to improve outcome vs. late (24-96 h) (Gastroenterology 2020;158:168).
* If [[hematochezia]] a/w orthostasis, concern for [[brisk UGIB]] ‚Üí exclude UGIB w/ EGD first.
* Push enteroscopy, anoscopy, capsule endoscopy in combo w/ urgent colo results in dx >95% of cases (GI Endo 2015;81:889).

## Imaging
* if too unstable for endo or recurrent bleeding, consider **IR embolization** or surgery
* [[tagged RBC scan]]: can identify general luminal location if bleeding **rate ‚â•0.04 mL/min** --> ÊúâÂ§†Ê∫ñÁöÑ
* CT angiography: faster to obtain than RBC scan, **detects bleeding ‚â•0.3 mL/min**
* arteriography: can localize exact vessel if bleeding **rates ‚â•0.5 mL/min**, allows for IR Rx
* Emergent exploratory laparotomy (last resort) if no localization and life-threatening bleed

* For [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding]] (UGIB), perform an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within 24 hours, as per the NEJM 2020 guidelines. If the bleeding is severe, administering [[erythromycin 250 mg]] intravenously 30 minutes prior to the endoscopy can increase the diagnostic and treatment yield.

* For [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding]] (LGIB), perform a colonoscopy, as it can identify the cause in more than 70% of cases. Early colonoscopy within 24 hours is unlikely to improve outcomes compared to a later colonoscopy within 24-96 hours, as per Gastro 2020. If there is hematochezia associated with orthostasis, there is a concern for brisk UGIB and exclude UGIB with EGD first. Combining push enteroscopy, anoscopy, and [[capsule endoscopy]] with an urgent colonoscopy results in a diagnosis in more than 95% of cases, as per GI Endo 2015.

* Imaging options can be used if a patient is too unstable for endoscopy or if there is recurrent bleeding. Interventional radiology (IR) embolization or surgery can be considered. A tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan can identify the general luminal location if the bleeding rate is ‚â•0.04 mL/min. A CT angiography is faster to obtain than an RBC scan and detects bleeding ‚â•0.3 mL/min. Arteriography can localize the exact vessel if the bleeding rate is ‚â•0.5 mL/min, and allows for IR treatment.

* An emergent exploratory laparotomy is a last resort option if no localization can be made and the bleeding is life-threatening.
