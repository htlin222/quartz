- GnRH antagonist:
  - Eg, degarelix. Pure GnRH antagonist-does not cause LH/FSH release. Testosterone suppressed w/in 3 d
- Bilateral orchiectomy:
  - Uncommon in the United States
- Can normalize PSA in >90% & cause tumor response in >80%, palliate bone pain & reduce complications 2Â° to prostate CA. Duration of response is â†’ variable
