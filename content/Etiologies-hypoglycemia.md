# Etiologies-hypoglycemia

* Pts w/ diabetes: excess insulin, oral hypoglycemics, missed meals, renal failure (↓ insulin & SU clearance); β-blockers can mask adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia
* Pt without diabetes: low fasting glucose w/o sx can be normal
* ↑ insulin: exogenous insulin, sulfonylureas, insulinoma, anti-insulin antibodies
* ↓ glucose production: hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, glucagon deficiency, hepatic failure, renal failure, CHF, alcoholism, sepsis, severe malnutrition
Postprandial, esp. postgastrectomy or gastric bypass: excessive response to glc load
↑ IGF-II: non-islet tumor (rare)
