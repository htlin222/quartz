# Brain abscess #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Brain abscess

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Complication of otitis media, sinusitis, odontogenic infection, post-surgical infection

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Often non-specific features, including fever, headache, and/or focal neurologic deficits. Classic triad of all three is present in only ~20% of cases.

â€¢Â Â Â Pathogens: *Streptococcus* spp. and *Staphylococcus* spp. are the most frequent organisms. Often polymicrobial infections (~40%) that contain both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Brain MRI. Needle aspiration and surgical excision are possible options for making a microbiologic diagnosis of the causative organism(s).

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Empiric antibiotics: vancomycin \+ ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12 hrs \+ metronidazole 500 mg IV/PO q8 hr

-Â Â Â Immediate neurosurgical evaluation for consideration of neurosurgical excision or drainage

-Â Â Â Consider adjunctive glucocorticoids if mass effect seen on imaging, but neurosurgical consultation should be used to make this decision

##### Spinal epidural abscess

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Bacteria can spread from infected vertebrae or nearby soft tissues, or via hematogenous spread

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features:

-Â Â Â Presentation is often slow and insidious with symptoms lasting weeks to months, but can be more acute with aggressive organisms like *S. aureus*

-Â Â Â Back pain is the most common symptom. Fever is variably present. ~50% of patients have a neurologic symptom (e.g., radiculopathy, motor or sensory dysfunction), which often develop later in the disease course.

â€¢Â Â Â Pathogens: *Streptococcus* spp. and *Staphylococcus* spp.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Spinal MRI

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Empiric antibiotics with vancomycin IV \+ ceftriaxone IV 2 g q12 hr. Ceftriaxone can be substituted for an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam, such as cefepime 2 g IV q8 hr.

-Â Â Â Immediate neurosurgical evaluation and consideration of surgical drainage
