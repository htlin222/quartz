* Blood cultures (before abx): **3 sets** (aerobic & anaerobic bottles) from different sites, ideally spaced ≥1 h apart.
	✓ BCx (at least 2 sets) after appropriate abx have been initiated to document clearance; repeat q24–48h until ⊖.

* Serial ECGs to assess for conduction disease and ↑ PR interval (c/f perivalvular abscess)

* [[echocardiogram as diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis]]
* [[transthoracic echo vs transesophageal echo in-Diagnosis-bacterial endocarditis]]

* Gated cardiac CT useful if TTE/TEE equivocal or suspected paravalvular abscess
* PET/CT using FDG useful for suspected PVE or CIED infxn if TTE/TEE equivocal
* Brain/spine imaging if concern for CNS spread (mycotic aneurysms, embolic stroke) or spinal involvement (vertebral osteo, epidural abscess)
* Cx ⊖ endocarditis: may be due to abx prior to BCx. PCR, bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA, serol. may be helpful. Detailed hx: animal exposure, travel, unpast. dairy, etc. ID eval. Consider organisms listed in Cx ⊖ footnote in microbiology table (vide supra).
