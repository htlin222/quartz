### Antipsychotic Medications

•   **CATIE Study (Phase 1).** *N Engl J Med* 2005;353:1209–1223.

-   Double-blind, randomized clinical trial that compared the use of a first-generation antipsychotic (perphenazine) with several newer drugs (“atypical” or “second-generation” antipsychotics) in patients with schitzophrenia. The efficacy of perphenazine was similar to that of quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone; however, the majority of patients in each group discontinued treatment due to inefficacy or side effects.
