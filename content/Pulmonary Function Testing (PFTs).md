# Pulmonary Function Testing (PFTs) #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Pulmonary Function Testing (PFTs)

â€¢Â Â Â Approach to interpreting PFTs:

-Â Â Â Key questions:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Is there obstruction?

**â€¢**Â Â Â Is there restriction?

**â€¢**Â Â Â Is there pathology disruptive to the alveolarâ€“capillary membrane?

-Â Â Â Approach: See Figures 2.8 and 2.9



**FIGURE 2.8: PFT Flowâ€“volume loops in health and disease.** In obstructive disease, the flowâ€“volume loop becomes curvilinear, whereas in restrictive disease the flowâ€“volume loop becomes steep/vertical.



**FIGURE 2.9: An approach to PFT interpretation.** Abbreviations: PFT = Pulmonary function test; FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in one second; FVC = forced vital capacity; DLCO = diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide; Wnl = within normal limits; ILD = interstitial lung disease; NM = neuromuscular disorder; Hct = hematocrit

**â€¢**Â Â Â **Assess flowâ€“volume loop**, if available (curvilinear = obstructive; steep/vertical = restrictive)

**â€¢**Â Â Â **Evaluate FEV1/FVC** (<0.7 = obstructive)

-Â Â Â If obstructive, assess reversibility and DLCO to determine etiology

**â€¢**Â Â Â **Evaluate TLC** (<80% predicted = restrictive)

-Â Â Â If restrictive, assess DLCO to determine etiology

**â€¢**Â Â Â **Evaluate DLCO**

-Â Â Â Consider methacholine challenge, as asthma may have baseline normal FEV1/FVC, TLC, DLCO
