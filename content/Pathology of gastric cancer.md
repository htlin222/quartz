# Pathology of gastric cancer

## Lauren histologic classification

- Intestinal:
  - Tumor cells arranged in tubular or glandular formations,
  - spreads through gastric wall as part of a tumor mass
- Diffuse:
  - Defective intercellular adhesion molecules allow tumor cells to invade w/o formation of tubules or glands;
  - spreads as discohesive cells throughout stomach wall;
  - highly metastatic;
  - signet-ring histology is â†’ a poor prognostic factor

## WHO classification: Tubular, papillary, mucinous, poorly cohesive incl. signet ring, adenosquamous, small cell, undifferentiated, squamous cell

- The CA genome atlas 4 subtypes:
  - EBV-positive (w/ recurrent PIK3CA muts,
  - higher prevalence of DNA hypermethylation),
  - microsatellite instability (MSI),
  - chromosomal instability (CIN) (â†‘ receptor tyrosine kinases incl. VEGFR2),
  - genomically stable (GS)

## Biomarkers w/ clinical implications

- HER2 overexpression:
  - Determined by HER2 IHC (3+), IHC equivocal (2+), & FISH amp, or HER2 gene amplification;
  - 10-20% of gastric adenoCAs MMR:
    - Determined by IHC for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 proteins PD-L1: Positive if combined positive score (CPS) â‰¥1;
  - unclear utility as responses seen w/ checkpoint inhibition in PD-L1 (-) tumors & significant interobserver variability EBV:
    - Gold standard is â†’ EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) NGS: Tumor sequencing for other targets (eg, NTRK)
