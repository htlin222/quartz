## HIDA scan:

> most Se test (80–90%) for acute cholecystitis.

* HIDA scan stands for **hepatobiliary [[iminodiacetic]] acid scan**.
* It is a diagnostic test used to assess the function of the gallbladder and bile ducts.
* It is considered the most sensitive (80-90%) test for acute cholecystitis, which is an inflammation of the gallbladder.
* During the test, a radioactive material and a chemical that helps highlight the bile ducts are injected into the patient's body.
* Images are then taken using a special camera to detect the movement of the material and the flow of bile, allowing doctors to diagnose any issues with the gallbladder or bile ducts.


* IV inj of HIDA (selectively secreted into bile).
* ⊕ if HIDA enters BD but not GB.
* 10–20% false ⊕ (cystic duct obstructed 2/2 chronic cholecystitis, lengthy fasting, liver disease).
