# Primary hyperparathyroidism

The serum level of parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be measured.
Patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism usually have low-normal calcium and elevated parathyroid hormone.
The serum phosphorus level may vary based on the etiology, trending towards higher values with reduced kidney function and lower values with vitamin D deficiency.
