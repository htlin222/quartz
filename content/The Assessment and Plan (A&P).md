### The Assessment and Plan (A&P)

The assessment and plan (A&P) is the most important part of the H&P (and the oral presentation). It shows that you can put the pieces of your history and physical exam together and form a problem representation, discuss a differential diagnosis, and come up with a plan for how to care for the patient.
