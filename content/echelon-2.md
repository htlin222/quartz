# echelon-2

- Design: Phase 3, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator
- Number of patients: 452
- Patients characteristics: Adults with previously untreated CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas
- Agent: Brentuximab vedotin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone for A+CHP group; cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone for CHOP group
- Treatment line: First-line
- Trial Acronym or NCTId Number: NCT01777152

| Parameter           | Result       |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| Median PFS (months) | 48.2 (A+CHP) |
|                     | 20.8 (CHOP)  |
| Hazard Ratio        | 0.71         |
| p-value             | 0.0110       |

- Highlight of toxicity: Similar incidence and severity of febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy between groups.
- One-line summarise: Front-line treatment with A+CHP showed superior progression-free survival and overall survival compared to CHOP in CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas with a manageable safety profile.
