# Gilteritinib or Chemotherapy For Relapsed Or Refractory FLT3-Mutated AML

**Information**

- **Design**: Phase 3, randomized, controlled, multi-center
- **Number of patients**: 371
- **Patients characteristics**: Adults with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
- **Agent**: Gilteritinib (120 mg per day) vs salvage chemotherapy
- **Treatment line**: Salvage therapy
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: ADMIRAL (NCT02421939)

**Comparison of two groups**

| Endpoint                                                     | Gilteritinib     | Salvage Chemotherapy |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Median Overall Survival                                      | 9.3 months       | 5.6 months           |
| Hazard Ratio for Death                                       | 0.64 (0.49-0.83) | -                    |
| Median Event-Free Survival                                   | 2.8 months       | 0.7 months           |
| Hazard Ratio for Treatment Failure or Death                  | 0.79 (0.58-1.09) | -                    |
| Complete Remission with Full or Partial Hematologic Recovery | 34.0%            | 15.3%                |
| Complete Remission                                           | 21.1%            | 10.5%                |

**Other findings**

- Adverse events of grade 3 or higher and serious adverse events occurred less frequently in the gilteritinib group than in the chemotherapy group
- The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher in the gilteritinib group were febrile neutropenia (45.9%), anemia (40.7%), and thrombocytopenia (22.8%)

**Summary**
In this phase 3 trial, gilteritinib, an oral, potent, selective FLT3 inhibitor, showed significant improvement in overall survival, event-free survival, and remission rates compared to salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia. Gilteritinib was also associated with fewer adverse events than chemotherapy.
