# Diagnostic studies-acute mesenteric ischemia

* Dx relies on high level of suspicion; rapid dx essential to avoid infarction (occurs w/in hrs)

* Mortality 20 to >70% if bowel infarcted; dx prior to infarction strongest predictor of survival

* Laboratory: often nl; ~75% ↑ WBC; ↑ amylase, LDH, PO4, D-dimer; ~50% ↑ lactate (late)

* KUB: nl early before infarct; “thumbprinting,” ileus, pneumatosis in later stages

* CT angiography (arterial phase): noninvasive test of choice; venous phase for dx MVT

* Angiography: gold standard; potentially therapeutic; indicated if vasc occlusion suspected
