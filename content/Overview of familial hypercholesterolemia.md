# Overview of familial hypercholesterolemia

Familial hypercholesterolemia affects the way the body processes cholesterol. As a result, people with familial hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of heart disease and a greater risk of early heart attack.

The genetic changes that cause familial hypercholesterolemia are inherited. The condition is present from birth, but symptoms may not appear until adulthood.

People who inherit the condition from both parents **usually develop symptoms in childhood**. If this rare and more severe variety is left untreated, **death often occurs before age 20**.

Treatments for both types of familial hypercholesterolemia include a variety of medications and healthy-lifestyle behaviors.
