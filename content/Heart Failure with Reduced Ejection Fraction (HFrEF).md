### Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)

â€¢Â Â Â **PARADIGM-HF.** *N Engl J Med* 2014;371(11):993-1004.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 8399 patients with HFrEF (LVEF â‰¤40%) and NYHA class IIâ€“IV symptoms to an angiotensin receptorâ€“neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril \+ valsartan combination (Entresto) 200 mg PO BID vs. enalapril 10 mg PO BID. Treatment with Entresto reduced CV mortality and HF hospitalizations compared to enalapril and was also associated with reduced all-cause mortality.

â€¢Â Â Â **DAPA-HF.** *N Engl J Med* 2019;381(21):1995â€“2008.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 4744 patients with HFrEF (EF â‰¤40%) and NYHA II-IV symptoms, with or without diabetes, to receive the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin or placebo. The addition of dapagliflozin decreased rates of CV death or worsening HF and all-cause mortality.
