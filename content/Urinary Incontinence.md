### Urinary Incontinence

**â€¢Physical exam:** Abdominal exam, rectal exam, pelvic exam in females, consider post-void residual

**â€¢Differential diagnosis:**

-Â Â Â **Urge incontinence**

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Sudden urge to urinate such that the patient may not make it to the bathroom, nocturnal bed-wetting. More common in elderly patients.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Urodynamics (incontinence is due to an overactive detrusor muscle)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Bladder training, anticholinergic (oxybutynin), TCA (imipramine)

-Â Â Â **Stress incontinence**

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Spurts of urine loss during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure (coughing, laughing, sneezing, exercising). More common in multiparous women.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Positive cough test, weakness of pelvic floor/sphincter leads to loss of bladder support

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises, pessary placement, surgery (urethropexy)

-Â Â Â **Overflow incontinence**

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Bladder does not empty completely, overdistension may lead to dribbling of urine. The patient may have a history of spinal cord injury or bladder outlet obstruction

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Elevated post void residual (PVR) due to obstruction

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Bethanechol, alpha-blockers (tamsulosin), surgical intervention to relieve obstruction

â€¢Â Â Â **Diagnosis:** In addition to the tests above, exclude causes of secondary urinary incontinence:

-Â Â Â Infection: UA to assess for urinary tract infection

-Â Â Â Constipation: Rectal exam to assess for stool impaction

-Â Â Â Functional status: Low mobility may be contributing to physical ability to reach the toilet

-Â Â Â Mental status: Delirium or dementia may be contributing to cognitive ability to reach the toilet

-Â Â Â Lifestyle: Assess for alcohol use, uncontrolled diabetes

-Â Â Â Medications: Diuretics, sedating medications, opioids
