# Approach to previously established HIV positive Pt
* H&P (mucocutaneous, neurocognitive, OIs, malignancies, STDs); meds and adherence
* Review ARVs (past and current); if hospitalized typically continue ARVs, if any must be held, stop all to ↓ risk of resistance
* Regimen failure: cannot achieve undetectable VL after months on ARVs, viral rebound (VL >200 copies/mL ×2 after prior suppression), ↓ CD4 count or clinical worsening
