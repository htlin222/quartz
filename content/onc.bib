CALGB 40603 (Alliance), a 2 � 2 factorial, open-label, randomized phase II trial, evaluated the impact of adding carboplatin and/or bevacizumab. Patients and Methods Patients (N = 443) with stage II to III TNBC received paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 once per week (wP) for 12 weeks, followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide once every 2 weeks (ddAC) for four cycles, and were randomly assigned to concurrent carboplatin (area under curve 6) once every 3 weeks for four cycles and/or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for nine cycles. Effects of adding these agents on pCR breast (ypT0/is), pCR breast/axilla (ypT0/isN0), treatment delivery, and toxicities were analyzed.

In cohort B of the phase II KEYNOTE-086 study, we evaluated pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for patients with PD-L1-positive mTNBC. Patients and methods Eligible patients had centrally confirmed mTNBC, no prior systemic anticancer therapy for metastatic disease, measurable disease at baseline per RECIST v1.1 by central review, no radiographic evidence of central nervous system metastases, and a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score ≥1. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included objective response rate, disease control rate (percentage of patients with complete or partial response or stable disease for ≥24 weeks), duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Results All 84 patients enrolled were women, and 73 (86.9\%) received prior (neo)adjuvant therapy. Fifty-three (63.1\%) patients had treatment-related adverse events (AEs), including 8 patients (9.5\%) with grade 3 severity; no patients experienced grade 4 AEs or died because of treatment-related AEs. Four patients had a complete response and 14 had a partial response, for an objective response rate of 21.4\% (95\% CI 13.9–31.4). Of the 13 patients with stable disease, 2 had stable disease lasting ≥24 weeks, for a disease control rate of 23.8\% (95\% CI 15.9–34.0). At data cut-off, 8 of 18 (44.4\%) responses were ongoing, and median duration of response was 10.4 months (range 4.2 to 19.2+). Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months (95\% CI 2.0–2.2), and median overall survival was 18.0 months (95\% CI 12.9–23.0). Conclusions Pembrolizumab monotherapy had a manageable safety profile and showed durable antitumor activity as first-line therapy for patients with PD-L1-positive mTNBC.

A good summary should be detailed and entity-centric without being overly dense and hard to follow. To better understand this tradeoff, we solicit increasingly dense GPT-4 summaries with what we refer to as a “Chain of Density” (CoD) prompt. Specifically, GPT-4 generates an initial entitysparse summary before iteratively incorporating missing salient entities without increasing the length. Summaries generated by CoD are more abstractive, exhibit more fusion, and have less of a lead bias than GPT-4 summaries generated by a vanilla prompt. We conduct a human preference study on 100 CNN DailyMail articles and find that that humans prefer GPT-4 summaries that are more dense than those generated by a vanilla prompt and almost as dense as human written summaries. Qualitative analysis supports the notion that there exists a tradeoff between informativeness and readability. 500 annotated CoD summaries, as well as an extra 5,000 unannotated summaries, are freely available on HuggingFace1.},

  abstract = {Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is a common condition that frequently results in reduced chemotherapy dosages, postponed treatment, bleeding, and unfavorable oncological outcomes. At present, there is no clear suggestions for preventing or treating CIT. Thrombopoietin (TPO) replacement therapy has been invented and used to treat CIT to promote the production of megakaryocytes and stimulate the formation of platelets. However, this treatment is limited to the risk of immunogenicity and cancer progression. Therefore, an unmet need exists for exploring alternatives to TPO to address the clinical issue of CIT. Application of appropriate therapeutic drugs may be due to understanding the potential mechanisms of CIT. Studies have shown that chemotherapy significantly affects various cells in bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, reduces their ability to support normal hematopoiesis, and may lead to BM damage, including CIT in cancer patients. This review focuses on the epidemiology and treatment of cancer patients with CIT. We also introduce some recent progress to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy inhibiting normal hematopoiesis and causing thrombocytopenia.}

A significant interleukin-4 response to the ALK peptides was detected in only one ALK-positive patient. CD4+ Th cell lines lysed ALK-positive ALCL cell lines in a MHC class II�𩂈estricted manner. This first report of a CD4+ Th response to ALK provides valuable information for developing future immunotherapeutic options for ALK-positive ALCL patients who fail to respond well to conventional therapies.

  abstract = {Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) has a good prognosis compared to ALK-negative ALCL, possibly as a result of the immune recognition of the ALK proteins. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence of both a B and cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response to ALK in ALK-positive ALCL. We confirmed the presence of an antibody response to ALK in all 9 ALK-positive ALCL patients investigated. An ELISpot assay was used to detect a gamma-interferon (IFN) T cell response after short term culture of mononuclear blood cells with 2 ALK-derived HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides: ALKa and ALKb. A significant gamma-IFN response was identified in all 7 HLA-A*0201-positive ALK-positive ALCL patients but not in ALK-negative ALCL patients (n = 2) or normal subjects (n = 6). CTL lines ({$>$}95\% CD8-positive) raised from 2 ALK-positive ALCL patients lysed ALK-positive ALCL derived cell lines in a MHC-Class I restricted manner. This is the first report of both a B cell and CTL response to ALK in patients with ALK-positive ALCL. This response persisted during long-term remission. The use of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) to express ALK is also described. Our findings are of potential prognostic value and open up therapeutic options for those ALK-positive patients who do not respond to conventional treatment.}

  abstract = {Importance Although treatment with first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)�懀yrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) plus antiangiogenic inhibitor has shown promising efficacies in patients withEGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma, recent single-arm studies have suggested that osimertinib plus antiangiogenic inhibitor might not work synergistically. Objective To explore the efficacy and safety of osimertinib plus bevacizumab compared with osimertinib alone in patients with lung adenocarcinoma withEGFRT790M mutation. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma that progressed with prior EGFR-TKI treatment (other than third-generation TKI) and acquiredEGFR T790M mutation were enrolled. This study comprises a lead-in part with 6 patients and a subsequent phase 2 part. In phase 2, patients were randomized to osimertinib plus bevacizumab or osimertinib alone in a 1:1 ratio. Interventions The combination arm received oral osimertinib (80 mg, every day) plus intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The control arm received osimertinib monotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by investigators. Secondary end points consisted of overall response rate, time to treatment failure, overall survival, and safety. Results From August 2017 through September 2018, a total of 87 patients were registered (6 in the lead-in part and 81 in the phase 2 part [intention-to-treat population]). Among those randomized, the median (range) age was 68 (41-82) years; 33 (41\%) were male; 37 (46\%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0; and 21 (26\%) had brain metastasis. Although the overall response rate was better with osimertinib plus bevacizumab than osimertinib alone (68\% vs 54\%), median PFS was not longer with osimertinib plus bevacizumab (9.4 months vs 13.5 months; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.44; 80\% CI, 1.00 to 2.08;P = .20). Median time to treatment failure was also shorter in the combination arm vs the osimertinib arm (8.4 months vs 11.2 months;P = .12). Median overall survival was not different in the combination arm vs osimertinib arm (not reached vs 22.1 months;P = .96). In the combination arm, common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were proteinuria (n = 9; 23\%), hypertension (n = 8; 20\%). Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial comparing osimertinib plus bevacizumab vs osimertinib alone, the combination arm failed to show prolongation of PFS in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma withEGFR T790M mutation.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying cetuximab and/or bevacizumab when given together with combination chemotherapy to compare how well they work in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving monoclonal antibodies together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with cetuximab and/or bevacizumab in treating patients with colorectal cancer.}

We performed a network meta-analysis comparing six treatment arms (lorlatinib, brigatinib, alectinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and platinum-based chemotherapy) in overall participants and in Asian and non-Asian subgroups. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and grade 3 or higher adverse events (G3-AEs). There were no significant differences between lorlatinib and alectinib in overall participants for both PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.742; 95\% credible interval [CrI], 0.466–1.180) and OS (HR, 1.180; 95\% CrI, 0.590–2.354). In the Asian subgroup, there were no significant differences in PFS between lorlatinib and alectinib (HR, 1.423; 95\% CrI, 0.748–2.708); however, in the non-Asian subgroup, PFS was significantly better with lorlatinib than with alectinib (HR, 0.388; 95\% CrI, 0.195–0.769). The incidence of G3-AEs in overall participants was significantly higher with lorlatinib than with alectinib (risk ratio, 1.918; 95\% CrI, 1.486–2.475).

The efficacy of PD-1 blockade as compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for MSI-H–dMMR advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown. METHODS In this phase 3, open-label trial, 307 patients with metastatic MSI-H–dMMR colorectal cancer who had not previously received treatment were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil–based therapy with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) every 2 weeks. Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab therapy after disease progression. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS At the second interim analysis, after a median follow-up (from randomization to data cutoff) of 32.4 months (range, 24.0 to 48.3), pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.80; P\,=\,0.0002). The estimated restricted mean survival after 24 months of follow-up was 13.7 months (range, 12.0 to 15.4) as compared with 10.8 months (range, 9.4 to 12.2). As of the data cutoff date, 56 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 69 in the chemotherapy group had died. Data on overall survival were still evolving (66\% of required events had occurred) and remain blinded until the final analysis. An overall response (complete or partial response), as evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was observed in 43.8\% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1\% in the chemotherapy group. Among patients with an overall response, 83\% in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 35\% of patients in the chemotherapy group, had ongoing responses at 24 months. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 22\% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 66\% (including one patient who died) in the chemotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS Pembrolizumab led to significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy when received as first-line therapy for MSI-H–dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

Their molecular spectrum, clinicopathologic characteristics, and prevalence are not well established. Tumors harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions were identified through an algorithmic screen of 1,500 lung adenocarcinomas. Cases were first tested for common mutations in EGFR (exons 19 and 21) and KRAS (exon 2) and, if negative, further analyzed for EGFR exon 20 insertions. All samples underwent extended genotyping for other driver mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2/HER2, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, and AKT by mass spectrometry; a subset was evaluated for ALK rearrangements. We identified 33 EGFR exon 20 insertion cases [2.2\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-3.1], all mutually exclusive with mutations in the other genes tested (except PIK3CA). They were more common among never-smokers (P {$<$} 0.0001). There was no association with age, sex, race, or stage. Morphologically, tumors were similar to those with common EGFR mutations but with frequent solid histology. Insertions were highly variable in position and size, ranging from 3 to 12 bp, resulting in 13 different insertions, which, by molecular modeling, are predicted to have potentially different effects on erlotinib binding. EGFR exon 20 insertion testing identifies a distinct subset of lung adenocarcinomas, accounting for at least 9\% of all EGFR-mutated cases, representing the third most common type of EGFR mutation after exon 19 deletions and L858R. Insertions are structurally heterogeneous with potential implications for response to EGFR inhibitors.}

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor has demonstrated efficacy in tumors harboring the EGFR T790M resistance mutation. Inevitably, resistance to third-generation inhibitors results in disease progression, with the EGFR C797S mutation being one of several resistance pathways identified to date. On the basis of preclinical data, we report what is the first known case of a patient harboring the T790M and C797S mutations in trans treated with combination gefitinib and osimertinib. Methods On development of progressive disease after multiple therapies, the patient's plasma was sequenced using the Oncomine Lung cfDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Subsequent monitoring of circulating tumor DNA in plasma was performed by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Results Sequencing showed that the T790M and C797S mutations were in trans. Within 2 weeks of commencement of combination therapy, rapid clinical improvement occurred. Accompanying this, a rapid decline in the C797S mutation subclone in plasma was detected. However, the levels of the EGFR exon 19 deletion driver mutation and the T790M resistance mutation in the circulating tumor DNA continued to rise and the patient died from progressive disease 6 weeks after commencement of combination therapy. There were no adverse events seen with the combination therapy. Conclusion This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of combination EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy tailored to the allelic conformation of T790M and C797S mutation that resulted in brief clinical improvement without toxicity.}

Patients with stage IIIB or IV chemotherapy-naive NSCLC with EGFR mutation were treated with 250 mg gefitinib daily. For mutational analysis, DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues and EGFR mutations were analysed by direct sequence of PCR products. Twenty (24\%) of the 82 patients analysed had EGFR mutations (deletions in or near E746-A750, n=16; L858R, n=4). Sixteen patients were enrolled and treated with gefitinib. Twelve patients had objective response and response rate was 75\% (95\% CI, 48��93\%). After a median follow-up of 12.7 months (range, 3.1��16.8 months), 10 patients demonstrated disease progression, with median progression-free survival of 8.9 months (95\% CI, 6.7��11.1 months). The median overall survival time has not yet been reached. Most of the toxicities were mild. This study showed that gefitinib is very active and well tolerated as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations.}

  abstract = {Purpose: Approximately one-third of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-sensitizing mutations (EGFRm) experience disease progression during treatment due to brain metastases. Despite anecdotal reports of EGFR-TKIs providing benefit in some patients with EGFRm NSCLC brain metastases, there is a clinical need for novel EGFR-TKIs with improved efficacy against brain lesions. Experimental design: We performed preclinical assessments of brain penetration and activity of osimertinib (AZD9291), an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR-TKI selective for EGFRm and T790M resistance mutations, and other EGFR-TKIs in various animal models of EGFR-mutant NSCLC brain metastases. We also present case reports of previously treated patients with EGFRm advanced NSCLC and brain metastases who received osimertinib in the phase I/II AURA study (NCT01802632). Results: Osimertinib demonstrated greater penetration of the mouse blood-brain barrier than gefitinib, rociletinib (CO-1686), or afatinib, and at clinically relevant doses induced sustained tumor regression in an EGFRm PC9 mouse brain metastases model; rociletinib did not achieve tumor regression. Under positron emission tomography micro-dosing conditions, [11C]osimertinib showed markedly greater exposure in the cynomolgus monkey brain than [11C]rociletinib and [11C]gefitinib. Early clinical evidence of osimertinib activity in previously treated patients with EGFRm advanced NSCLC and brain metastases is also reported. Conclusions: Osimertinib may represent a clinically significant treatment option for patients with EGFRm NSCLC and brain metastases. Further investigation of osimertinib in this patient population is ongoing.}

  abstract = {Background: In the metastatic setting, cancer patients may not benefit from standard care regimes and their diseases undergo drug resistance due to tumour cell heterogeneity and genomic landscape complexity. In recent years, there have been several attempts to personalise the diagnostic-therapeutic path and to propose novel strategies based on not only histological test results but also on each patient’s clinical history and molecular biology. Profiling molecular tests allows physicians to investigate the single tumour genomic landscape and to promote targeted approaches. The Molecular Tumour Board (MTB) is a multidisciplinary committee dedicated to selecting individualised and targeted therapeutic strategies appropriate for patients suffering from diseases that present resistance to standard care. Materials and Methods: Our MTB settled in “Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria delle Marche”, Ancona (AN), Italy, and includes oncologists, molecular biologists, geneticists, and other specialists. Clinical cases are referred by physicians to the MTB, through the Cancer and Research Centre of the Marche Region (CORM), through a telemedicine platform. Four possible molecular profiles are available: FoundationOne® CDx e FoundationOne®Liquid CDx and two local Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels, with 16 DNA genes and 10 RNA genes respectively. The resulting genetic mutations and their analyses are evaluated by all the members of the Board and a report for each patient is provided with medical recommendations. Results: from June 2021 to May 2023, we collected data from 97 referral patients (M: 49, F: 48). The mean age was 60.6 years (range 22–83 years). 90 cases were approved for testing. Only seven patients were not eligible for genomic profiling. In two patients who were eligible, molecular profiling was not performed because a tissue sample was not available. Off-label therapy was recommended for three patients. 5\% of cases (5/88) showed addressable driver mutations associated with an existing targeted therapy and were immediately enrolled. Conclusions: MTB presents a powerful tool for offering precise medical goals. Our Department of Clinical Oncology also takes advantage of the important role of multidisciplinary teams, through the establishment of CORM and MTB meetings, within which there is the chance to perform NGS-based analyses. It will be important in the future to implement the use of genomic profiling to improve personalised care and to guide the choice of suitable therapies and more appropriate management of patients.},

Unfortunately, about a quarter of patients receiving neoadjuvant trastuzumab experience disease recurrence, revealing the unquestionable need for further improvement of treatment outcomes. SUMMARY: Adding HER2 blockade to adjuvant trastuzumab with pertuzumab and neratinib improves invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), particularly for those at highest risk of recurrence. A shift toward a neoadjuvant strategy for patients with a higher risk of recurrence could result in further treatment optimization. For patients without a pathological complete response (pCR) after the neoadjuvant part of the therapy, a switch to adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine significantly improves IDFS and distant recurrence-free survival and shows a trend towards improved overall survival (OS). On the other hand, for low-risk patients, chemotherapy deescalation should be strongly considered with the use of trastuzumab monotherapy as an anti-HER2 backbone. KEY MESSAGES: Neoadjuvant therapy should be offered for a significant proportion of HER2-positive early breast cancer patients with a higher risk of recurrence. Postneoadjuvant treatment should be tailored according to the initial stage of disease and the response to neoadjuvant treatment.},

Before systemic treatment initiation, determination of tumour genomic status for KRAS and NRAS, BRAFV600E mutations, ERBB2, and microsatellite instability and/or mismatch repair (MMR) status is recommended. In patients with deficient MMR and BRAFV600E mCRC, randomized phase III trials have established the efficacy of pembrolizumab as first-line therapy and the combination of encorafenib and cetuximab as second-line or third-line therapy. In addition, new agents have been actively developed in other rare molecular fractions such as ERBB2 alterations and KRASG12C mutations. In March 2022, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for ERBB2-positive mCRC was approved in Japan, thereby combining real-world evidence from the SCRUM-Japan Registry. As the populations are highly fragmented owing to rare genomic alterations, various strategies in clinical development are expected. Clinical development of a tumour-agnostic approach, such as NTRK fusion and tumour mutational burden, has successfully introduced corresponding drugs to clinical practice. Considering the difficulty of randomized trials owing to cost–benefit and rarity, a promising solution could be real-world evidence utilized as an external control from the molecular-based disease registry.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent efforts of gene expression profiling analyses recognized at least four different triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) molecular subtypes. However, little is known regarding their tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity. Methods: Here, we investigated TME heterogeneity within each TNBC molecular subtype, including immune infiltrate localization and composition together with expression of targetable immune pathways, using publicly available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from a large TNBC series totaling 1512 samples. Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features were assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma, and metabolism biological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, luminal androgen receptor, and mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and metabolism TME signatures and enriched in marginrestricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in the chromosome 5q and 15q regions, including genomic loss of major histocompatibility complex related genes, showed reduced cytotoxic activity as a plausible immune escape mechanism. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of immunotherapy in TNBC patients.},

In this Review, we describe vascular, stromal and immunological changes induced in the tumour microenvironment by irradiation and discuss how they may promote radioresistance and tumour recurrence. Subsequently, we highlight how this knowledge is guiding the development of new treatment paradigms in which biologically targeted agents will be combined with radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {Background: The molecular profiling of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for known oncogenic drivers is recommended during routine care. Nationally, however, the feasibility and effects on outcomes of this policy are unknown. We aimed to assess the characteristics, molecular profiles, and clinical outcomes of patients who were screened during a 1-year period by a nationwide programme funded by the French National Cancer Institute. Methods This study included patients with advanced NSCLC, who were routinely screened for EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, as well as HER2 (ERBB2), KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations by 28 certified regional genetics centres in France. Patients were assessed consecutively during a 1-year period from April, 2012, to April, 2013. We measured the frequency of molecular alterations in the six routinely screened genes, the turnaround time in obtaining molecular results, and patients' clinical outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01700582. Findings 18 679 molecular analyses of 17 664 patients with NSCLC were done (of patients with known data, median age was 64繚5 years [range 18��98], 65\% were men, 81\% were smokers or former smokers, and 76\% had adenocarcinoma). The median interval between the initiation of analysis and provision of the written report was 11 days (IQR 7��16). A genetic alteration was recorded in about 50\% of the analyses; EGFR mutations were reported in 1947 (11\%) of 17 706 analyses for which data were available, HER2 mutations in 98 (1\%) of 11 723, KRAS mutations in 4894 (29\%) of 17 001, BRAF mutations in 262 (2\%) of 13 906, and PIK3CA mutations in 252 (2\%) of 10 678; ALK rearrangements were reported in 388 (5\%) of 8134 analyses. The median duration of follow-up at the time of analysis was 24繚9 months (95\% CI 24繚8��25繚0). The presence of a genetic alteration affected first-line treatment for 4176 (51\%) of 8147 patients and was associated with a significant improvement in the proportion of patients achieving an overall response in first-line treatment (37\% [95\% CI 34繚7��38繚2] for presence of a genetic alteration vs 33\% [29繚5��35繚6] for absence of a genetic alteration; p=0繚03) and in second-line treatment (17\% [15繚0��18繚8] vs 9\% [6繚7��11繚9]; p{$<$}0繚0001). Presence of a genetic alteration was also associated with improved first-line progression-free survival (10繚0 months [95\% CI 9繚2��10繚7] vs 7繚1 months [6繚1��7繚9]; p{$<$}0繚0001) and overall survival (16繚5 months [15繚0��18繚3] vs 11繚8 months [10繚1��13繚5]; p{$<$}0繚0001) compared with absence of a genetic alteration. Interpretation Routine nationwide molecular profiling of patients with advanced NSCLC is feasible. The frequency of genetic alterations, acceptable turnaround times in obtaining analysis results, and the clinical advantage provided by detection of a genetic alteration suggest that this policy provides a clinical benefit.}

The timing and grade of CIN may play prognostic and predictive roles in cancer therapy. CIN is associated with older age, poor functional and nutritional status, the presence of significant comorbidities, the type of cancer, previous chemotherapy cycles, the stage of the disease, specific chemotherapy regimens, and combined therapies. There are many key points and new challenges in the management of CIN in adults including: (1) Genetic risk factors to evaluate the patient's risk for CIN remain unclear. However, these risk factors urgently need to be identified. (2) Febrile neutropenia (FN) remains one of the most common reasons for oncological emergency. No consensus nomogram for FN risk assessment has been established. (3) Different assessment tools [e.g., Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC), the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia (CISNE) score model, and other tools] have been suggested to help stratify the risk of complications in patients with FN. However, current tools have limitations. The CISNE score model is useful to support decision-making, especially for patients with stable FN. (4) There are still some challenges, including the benefits of granulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment and the optimal antibiotic regimen in emergency management of FN. In view of the current reports, our group discusses the key points, new challenges, and management of CIN.}

  abstract = {535 Background: Prior ARIES analyses showed that BV-treated mCRC patients (pts) receiving chemotherapy (CT)/biologics + BV within 2 months (mo) after 1st progressive disease (PD) had longer post-progression survival (PPS) than pts receiving only CT/biologics. 背景：先前的ARIES分析顯示，在1個 st 進展性疾病（PD）後2個月內接受化療（CT）/生物製劑+ BV的BV治療的轉移性結直腸癌患者（pts）比僅接受CT/生物製劑的PTS具有更長的進展後存留期（PPS）。 The present analysis evaluated whether this effect of BV was consistent when used with common 2L CT regimens— irinotecan- (iri-) and oxaliplatin- (ox-) based—in mCRC pts exposed to 1L BV in ARIES. 本分析評估了BV的這種效果在與常見的2L CT方案（伊立替康（iri-）和奧沙利鉑（ox-））一起使用時是否一致，用於暴露於ARIES中暴露於1L BV的mCRC pts。 Methods: ARIES enrolled mCRC pts receiving 1L CT + BV. No tx regimens or assessments were protocol specified. 方法：ARIES招募接受1L CT + BV的mCRC pts。沒有具體的TX治療方案或評估方案。 This analysis evaluated 1L BV-treated mCRC pts who had PD, survived ≥2 mo after PD, and received 2L iri- or ox-based tx. PPS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. 該分析評估了1L BV處理的mCRC pts，他們患有PD，PD後存活≥2 mo，並接受2L虹膜或基於牛的TX。PPS是通過Kaplan-Meier方法估計的。 Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs), while adjusting for covariates (eg, 1L time to progression). Cox回歸用於估計風險比（HRs），同時調整協變數（例如，1L進展時間）。 Results: Of 1550 1L pts in ARIES, 1074 had 1st PD and survived ≥2 mo after PD. Of these 1074, 390 and 114 received 2L iri- and ox-based tx, respectively, ± BV (table). Baseline characteristics were generally similar between groups. The incidence of targeted adverse events (TAEs) was as expected and similar between the BV and No BV groups over time. In pts receiving 2L iri- or ox-based CT tx, PPS in BV-treated pts was longer compared to those not on BV. Analyses may be limited by small pt numbers in some groups. Conclusions: Consistent with prior ARIES analyses, the continued use of BV after 1st PD was associated with prolonged PPS regardless of the 2L CT backbone used. 	2L iri-based tx 	2L ox-based tx 	No BV (n = 190)	BV (n = 200)	No BV (n = 29)	BV (n = 85) Median PPS, mo (95\% CI)	6.8 (5.3-8.0)	13.4 (11.7-15.1)	4.1 (2.9-8.9)	12.5 (8.2-14.2) HR (95\% CI)	1.0	0.52 (0.40-0.67)	1.0	0.51 (0.23-1.14) TAEs by interval, \%				 {$\quad\quad\quad\quad$}Any time	17	24	38	34 {$\quad\quad\quad\quad$} Mo 0–{$<$}6	14	16	31	22 {$\quad\quad\quad\quad$} Mo 6–{$<$}12	5	4	11	8 {$\quad\quad\quad\quad$}Mo ≥12	4	7	0	10 PPS = time from 2 mo after 1st PD to death from any cause; TAEs include worsening hypertension, GI perforations, arterial and venous thromboembolic events, bleeding events, postoperative wound healing complications, congestive heart failure, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab plus fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is standard treatment for first-line and bevacizumab-naive second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We assessed continued use of bevacizumab plus standard second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer progressing after standard first-line bevacizumab-based treatment. METHODS: In an open-label, phase 3 study in 220 centres in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, patients (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable, histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer progressing up to 3 months after discontinuing first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to second-line chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab 2·5 mg/kg per week equivalent (either 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 7·5 mg/kg every 3 weeks, intravenously). The choice between oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based second-line chemotherapy depended on the first-line regimen (switch of chemotherapy). A combination of a permuted block design and the Pocock and Simon minimisation algorithm was used for the randomisation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00700102. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2006, and June 9, 2010, 409 (50\%) patients were assigned to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 411 (50\%) to chemotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 11·1 months (IQR 6·4-15·6) in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group and 9·6 months (5·4-13·9) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 11·2 months (95\% CI 10·4-12·2) for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 9·8 months (8·9-10·7) for chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0·81, 95\% CI 0·69-0·94; unstratified log-rank test p=0·0062). Grade 3-5 bleeding or haemorrhage (eight [2\%] vs one [{$<$}1\%]), gastrointestinal perforation (seven [2\%] vs three [{$<$}1\%]), and venous thromboembolisms (19 [5\%] vs 12 [3\%]) were more common in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group. The most frequently reported grade 3-5 adverse events were neutropenia (65 [16\%] in the bevacizumab and chemotherapy group vs 52 [13\%] in the chemotherapy alone group), diarrhoea (40 [10\%] vs 34 [8\%], respectively), and asthenia (23 [6\%] vs 17 [4\%], respectively). Treatment-related deaths were reported for four patients in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group and three in the chemotherapy alone group. INTERPRETATION: Maintenance of VEGF inhibition with bevacizumab plus standard second-line chemotherapy beyond disease progression has clinical benefits in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. This approach is also being investigated in other tumour types, including metastatic breast and non-small cell lung cancers. FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.},

In the past few years, advances in omics technologies have shed light on the relevance of the TNBC microenvironment heterogeneity, unveiling a close dynamic relationship with cancer cell features. An improved understanding of tumour–immune system co-evolution supports the need to adopt a more comprehensive view of TNBC as an ecosystem that encompasses the intrinsic and extrinsic features of cancer cells. This new appreciation of the biology of TNBC has already led to the development of novel targeted agents, including PARP inhibitors, antibody–drug conjugates and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, which are revolutionizing the therapeutic landscape and providing new opportunities both for patients with early-stage TNBC and for those with advanced-stage disease. The current therapeutic scenario is only the tip of the iceberg, as hundreds of new compounds and combinations are in development. The translation of these experimental therapies into clinical benefit is a welcome and ongoing challenge. In this Review, we describe the current and upcoming therapeutic landscape of TNBC and discuss how an integrated view of the TNBC ecosystem can define different levels of risk and provide improved opportunities for tailoring treatment.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Patients with pretreated estrogen receptor (ER)–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative advanced breast cancer have poor prognosis. Elacestrant is a novel, oral selective ER degrader that demonstrated activity in early studies. METHODS This randomized, open-label, phase III trial enrolled patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had one-two lines of endocrine therapy, required pretreatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and ≤ 1 chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to elacestrant 400 mg orally once daily or standard-of-care (SOC) endocrine monotherapy. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review in all patients and patients with detectable ESR1 mutations. RESULTS Patients were randomly assigned to elacestrant (n = 239) or SOC (n = 238). ESR1 mutation was detected in 47.8\% of patients, and 43.4\% received two prior endocrine therapies. PFS was prolonged in all patients (hazard ratio = 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; P = .002) and patients with ESR1 mutation (hazard ratio = 0.55; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.77; P = .0005). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 7.2\% receiving elacestrant and 3.1\% receiving SOC. Treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations were 3.4\% in the elacestrant arm versus 0.9\% in SOC. Nausea of any grade occurred in 35.0\% receiving elacestrant and 18.8\% receiving SOC (grade 3/4, 2.5\% and 0.9\%, respectively). CONCLUSION Elacestrant is the first oral selective ER degrader demonstrating a significant PFS improvement versus SOC both in the overall population and in patients with ESR1 mutations with manageable safety in a phase III trial for patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Human lung adenocarcinomas with activating mutations in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) often respond to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the magnitude of tumour regression is variable and transient. This heterogeneity in treatment response could result from genetic modifiers that regulate the degree to which tumour cells are dependent on mutant EGFR. Through a pooled RNA interference screen, we show that knockdown of FAS and several components of the NF-庥B pathway specifically enhanced cell death induced by the EGFR TKI erlotinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. Activation of NF-庥B through overexpression of c-FLIP or IKK (also known as CFLAR and IKBKB, respectively), or silencing of I庥B (also known as NFKBIA), rescued EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells from EGFR TKI treatment. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-庥B enhanced erlotinib-induced apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer models. Increased expression of the NF-庥B inhibitor I庥B predicted for improved response and survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients treated with EGFR TKI. These data identify NF-庥B as a potential companion drug target, together with EGFR, in EGFR-mutant lung cancers and provide insight into the mechanisms by which tumour cells escape from oncogene dependence.}

  abstract = {Purpose               The antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1) combines the biologic activity of trastuzumab with targeted delivery of a potent antimicrotubule agent, DM1, to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) –overexpressing cancer cells. Based on results from a phase I study that showed T-DM1 was well tolerated at the maximum-tolerated dose of 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, with evidence of efficacy, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who were previously treated with trastuzumab, we conducted a phase II study to further define the safety and efficacy of T-DM1 in this patient population.                                         Patients and Methods               This report describes a single-arm phase II study (TDM4258g) that assessed efficacy and safety of intravenous T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in patients with HER2-positive MBC who had tumor progression after prior treatment with HER2-directed therapy and who had received prior chemotherapy.                                         Results               With a follow-up of ≥ 12 months among 112 treated patients, the objective response rate by independent assessment was 25.9\% (95\% CI, 18.4\% to 34.4\%). Median duration of response was not reached as a result of insufficient events (lower limit of 95\% CI, 6.2 months), and median progression-free survival time was 4.6 months (95\% CI, 3.9 to 8.6 months). The response rates were higher among patients with confirmed HER2-positive tumors (immunohistochemistry 3+ or fluorescent in situ hybridization positive) by retrospective central testing (n = 74). Higher response rates were also observed in patients whose tumors expressed ≥ median HER2 levels by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for HER2 expression, compared with patients who had less than median HER2 levels. T-DM1 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting cardiotoxicity. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2; the most frequent grade ≥ 3 AEs were hypokalemia (8.9\%), thrombocytopenia (8.0\%), and fatigue (4.5\%).                                         Conclusion               T-DM1 has robust single-agent activity in patients with heavily pretreated, HER2-positive MBC and is well tolerated at the recommended phase II dose.},

METHODS An Expert Panel conducted a systematic review to identify new, potentially practice-changing data. RESULTS Fifty-one articles met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the recommendations. RECOMMENDATIONS Alpelisib in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) should be offered to postmenopausal patients, and to male patients, with HR-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA-mutated, ABC, or MBC following prior endocrine therapy with or without a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor. Clinicians should use next-generation sequencing in tumor tissue or cell-free DNA in plasma to detect PIK3CA mutations. If no mutation is found in cell-free DNA, testing in tumor tissue, if available, should be used as this will detect a small number of additional patients with PIK3CA mutations. There are insufficient data at present to recommend routine testing for ESR1 mutations to guide therapy for HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC. For BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer, olaparib or talazoparib should be offered in the 1st-line through 3rd-line setting. A nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) and a CDK4/6 inhibitor should be offered to postmenopausal women with treatment-naïve HR-positive MBC. Fulvestrant and a CDK4/6 inhibitor should be offered to patients with progressive disease during treatment with AIs (or who develop a recurrence within 1 year of adjuvant AI therapy) with or without one line of prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, or as first-line therapy. Treatment should be limited to those without prior exposure to CDK4/6 inhibitors in the metastatic setting. Additional information can be found at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background The 16th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference 2019 in Vienna, Austria reviewed substantial new evidence on loco-regional and systemic therapies for early breast cancer. Design Treatments were assessed in light of their intensity, duration and side-effects, estimating the magnitude of clinical benefit according to stage and biology of the disease. The Panel acknowledged that for many patients, the impact of adjuvant therapy or the adherence to specific guidelines may have modest impact on the risk of breast cancer recurrence or overall survival. For that reason, the Panel explicitly encouraged clinicians and patients to routinely discuss the magnitude of benefit for interventions as part of the development of the treatment plan. Results The guidelines focus on common ductal and lobular breast cancer histologies arising in generally healthy women. Special breast cancer histologies may need different considerations, as do individual patients with other substantial health considerations. The panelists' opinions reflect different interpretation of available data and expert opinion where is lack of evidence and sociocultural factors in their environment such as availability of and access to medical service, economic resources and reimbursement issues. Panelists encourage patient participation in well-designed clinical studies whenever available. Conclusions With these caveats in mind, the St. Gallen Consensus Conference seeks to provide guidance to clinicians on appropriate treatments for early-stage breast cancer and guidance for weighing the realistic tradeoffs between treatment and toxicity so that patients and clinical teams can make well-informed decisions on the basis of an honest reckoning of the magnitude of clinical benefit.}

This study was undertaken to determine ICI efficacy against epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)/c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1)-mutated NSCLC patients in the real-world setting.In this retrospective, multicenter study on adults with ICI-treated EGFR-mutated or ALK- or ROS1-translated NSCLCs, we analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes: ICI-treatment duration, and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, duration of response, and overall survival (OS) from immunotherapy initiation.Fifty-one NSCLC patients (mean age, 58.0 years) were included from 20 French centers: 61\% were never-smokers and 59\% were women. Among them, 82\% had EGFR-activating mutations, 16\% ALK translocations, or 2\% ROS1 translocations. Before ICI therapy, patients had received a median of 3 treatment lines (including tyrosine-kinase inhibitor). The median PFS was 2.1 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-3.2) months for the entire cohort, 2.2 (95\% CI, 1.4-3.2) for EGFR-mutated patients, and 2.4 (95\% CI, 2.1-not reached) months for ALK-translocated patients.

Amivantamab, a fully human bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET, is approved in the United States and other countries for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, for whom disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Preliminary efficacy and safety have also been demonstrated in patients with common EGFR- or MET-mutated NSCLC. Amivantamab employs 3 distinct potential mechanisms of action (MOAs) including ligand blocking, receptor degradation, and immune cell-directing activity, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and trogocytosis. Notably, efficacy with amivantamab does not require all 3 MOAs to occur simultaneously, broadening applicability by using diverse antitumor mechanisms. This review focuses on the molecular characteristics of amivantamab and its unique MOAs leading to in vitro and in vivo efficacy and safety in preclinical and clinical studies.}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The initial design of this trial was a randomized, two-arm, noninferiority, phase III comparison of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4. After patient accrual had begun, the trial design was amended in 2003 after bevacizumab phase III data became available. The resulting 2 x 2 factorial design randomly assigned patients to XELOX versus FOLFOX-4, and then to also receive either bevacizumab or placebo. We report here the results of the analysis of the XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 arms. The analysis of bevacizumab versus placebo with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is reported separately. The prespecified primary end point for the noninferiority analysis was progression-free survival. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population comprised 634 patients from the original two-arm portion of the study, plus an additional 1,400 patients after the start of the amended 2 x 2 design, for a total of 2,034 patients. The median PFS was 8.0 months in the pooled XELOX-containing arms versus 8.5 months in the FOLFOX-4-containing arms (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 97.5\% CI, 0.93 to 1.16). The median overall survival was 19.8 months with XELOX versus 19.6 months with FOLFOX-4 (HR, 0.99; 97.5\% CI, 0.88 to 1.12). FOLFOX-4 was associated with more grade 3/4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia and febrile neutropenia than XELOX, and XELOX with more grade 3 diarrhea and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome than FOLFOX-4. CONCLUSION: XELOX is noninferior to FOLFOX-4 as a first-line treatment for MCRC, and may be considered as a routine treatment option for appropriate patients.},

  abstract = {Drug resistance is perhaps the greatest challenge in improving outcomes for cancer patients undergoing treatment with targeted therapies. It is becoming clear that "persisters," a subpopulation of drug-tolerant cells found in cancer populations, play a critical role in the development of drug resistance. Persisters are able to maintain viability under therapy but are typically slow cycling or dormant. These cells do not harbor classic drug resistance driver alterations, and their partial resistance phenotype is transient and reversible upon removal of the drug. In the clinic, the persister state most closely corresponds to minimal residual disease from which relapse can occur if treatment is discontinued or if acquired drug resistance develops in response to continuous therapy. Thus, eliminating persister cells will be crucial to improve outcomes for cancer patients. Using lung cancer targeted therapies as a primary paradigm, this review will give an overview of the characteristics of drug-tolerant persister cells, mechanisms associated with drug tolerance, and potential therapeutic opportunities to target this persister cell population in tumors.}

  abstract = {Simple Summary Lung cancer is still one of the most commonly diagnosed and deadliest cancers in the world. Its diagnosis at an early stage is highly necessary and will improve the standard of care of this disease. The aim of this article is to review the importance and applications of next generation sequencing in lung cancer diagnosis. As observed in many studies, next generation sequencing has been proven as a very helpful tool in the early detection of different types of cancers, including lung cancer, and has been used in the clinic, mainly due to its many advantages, such as low cost, speed, efficacy, low quantity usage of biological samples, and diversity. Abstract Lung cancer is still one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and one of the deadliest. The high death rate is mainly due to the late stage of diagnosis and low response rate to therapy. Previous and ongoing research studies have tried to discover new reliable and useful cbiomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer. Next generation sequencing has become an essential tool in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of the treatment response. This article aims to review the leading research and clinical applications in lung cancer diagnosis using next generation sequencing. In this scope, we identified the most relevant articles that present the successful use of next generation sequencing in identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis correlated to lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. This technique can be used to evaluate a high number of biomarkers in a short period of time and from small biological samples, which makes NGS the preferred technique to develop clinical tests for personalized medicine using liquid biopsy, the new trend in oncology.},

  abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade with PD-(L)1 antibodies has revolutionized the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Similarly, the identification and targeting of oncogene drivers in metastatic NSCLC has dramatically improved patient outcomes with an expanding list of potentially actionable alterations and targeted therapies. Many of these molecular aberrations are more common in patients with little or no smoking history and adenocarcinoma histology. Certain molecular subsets of NSCLC, though gaining greatly from targeted therapy approaches, may derive less benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. The optimal identification, targeting, and sequencing of targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy are essential to continue to improve patient outcomes in advanced NSCLC. Herein, we review the role of immunotherapy in locally advanced and metastatic disease for patients with actionable driver alterations. Never-smoking patients have a high probability of having lung cancer that harbors one of these molecular aberrations that can be matched to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with greatly improved clinical outcomes. Some of these patients with driver mutations may derive less benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor approaches (either alone or combined with chemotherapy), especially compared with smoking-associated NSCLC. Given that PD-1 blockade alone or with platinum-based chemotherapy is the de facto first-line therapy (depending on level of PD-L1 expression) for nontargetable metastatic NSCLC, we also review treatment in never-smoking patients for whom molecular testing results are pending and the likelihood of identifying a driver mutation is high.}

  abstract = {Targeted treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutation         ,            Background         , The most common type of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 5\% of NSCLC will be driven by a gene mutation known as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Targeted treatments for those with advanced (not curable) ALK‐mutated NSCLC cancer have been developed and found to be more effective than chemotherapy. The first ALK inhibitor to be developed was crizotinib. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs have also been developed and include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib.~In this review we looked at treatments that target ALK‐mutated NSCLC to find out how well they work.,            Objectives~         , The primary objective of this review was to find out whether people with ALK‐mutated NSCLC~given treatments targeted towards ALK live longer without recurrence and have fewer side effects than those treated~with chemotherapy. We also planned~to evaluate whether newer ALK‐targeted drugs achieve~this~better~than crizotinib.~,            Study characteristics         , We searched the main medical databases and records of conferences up to~7~January 2021. We found 11 studies~(2874 participants): six studies~compared an ALK‐targeted drug to chemotherapy, and five studies~compared a newer~ALK‐targeted drug to crizotinib. The studies were conducted~in people with advanced ALK‐mutated NSCLC using these drugs as their first or later treatment. A total of five different ALK inhibitors were used across studies: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib.,            Results         , People treated with ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those on chemotherapy. These improvements were also seen in people with cancer that had spread to the brain. People receiving ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer overall, even when some had received chemotherapy first. ALK‐targeted drugs cause a similar number of side effects as chemotherapy.~ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size and resulted in a longer time until worsening of symptoms when compared to chemotherapy.~, People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those receiving crizotinib, including in people with cancer involving the brain. People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs as first treatment were likely to live longer overall with a similar number of overall side effects. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size when compared to crizotinib., The evidence for most reported measures was of moderate or high certainty.,            Conclusions         , The best first treatment for people with incurable ALK‐mutated lung cancer is a newer ALK inhibitor such as alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. More studies are needed to determine which of these options is best and what treatment should be used when the cancer grows after these medicines have been given.},

The efficacy of brigatinib, as compared with crizotinib, in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who have not previously received an ALK inhibitor is unclear. Methods In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had not previously received ALK inhibitors to receive brigatinib at a dose of 180 mg once daily (with a 7-day lead-in period at 90 mg) or crizotinib at a dose of 250 mg twice daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary end points included the objective response rate and intracranial response.

  abstract = {Summary Background ALK fusion genes occur in a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). We assessed the tolerability and activity of crizotinib in patients with NSCLC who were prospectively identified to have an ALK fusion within the first-in-man phase 1 crizotinib study. Methods In this phase 1 study, patients with ALK -positive stage III or IV NSCLC received oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Endpoints included tumour responses, duration of response, time to tumour response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival at 6 and 12 months, and determination of the safety and tolerability and characterisation of the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of crizotinib after oral administration. Responses were analysed in evaluable patients and PFS and safety were analysed in all patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00585195. Findings Between Aug 27, 2008, and June 1, 2011, 149 ALK -positive patients were enrolled, 143 of whom were included in the response-evaluable population. 87 of 143 patients had an objective response (60繚8\%, 95\% CI 52繚3��68繚9), including three complete responses and 84 partial responses. Median time to first documented objective response was 7繚9 weeks (range 2繚1��39繚6) and median duration of response was 49繚1 weeks (95\% CI 39繚3��75繚4). The response rate seemed to be largely independent of age, sex, performance status, or line of treatment. Median PFS was 9繚7 months (95\% CI 7繚7��12繚8). Median overall survival data are not yet mature, but estimated overall survival at 6 and 12 months was 87繚9\% (95\% CI 81繚3��92繚3) and 74繚8\% (66繚4��81繚5), respectively. 39 patients continued to receive crizotinib for more than 2 weeks after progression because of perceived ongoing clinical benefit from the drug (12 for at least 6 months from the time of their initial investigator-defined disease progression). Overall, 144 (97\%) of 149 patients experienced treatment-related adverse events, which were mostly grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events were visual effects, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, and peripheral oedema. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (n=9), raised alanine aminotransferase (n=6), hypophosphataemia (n=6), and lymphopenia (n=6). Interpretation Crizotinib is well tolerated with rapid, durable responses in patients with ALK -positive NSCLC. There seems to be potential for ongoing benefit after initial disease progression in this population, but a more formal definition of ongoing benefit in this context is needed. Funding Pfizer.}

  abstract = {UNLABELLED : Genotype-based selection of patients for targeted therapies has had a substantial impact on the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed at cancers driven by oncogenes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements, often achieve dramatic responses and result in prolonged survival compared with chemotherapy. However, TKI resistance invariably develops. Disease progression can be limited to only one or a few sites and might not be symptomatic, raising the important question of whether this type of oligoprogression warrants a change in systemic therapy or consideration of local treatment. Recent clinical observations suggest a growing role for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of oligoprogressive and perhaps even oligopersistent disease (primary and/or metastases) in oncogene-driven NSCLC. SBRT might allow patients to continue with existing TKI treatments longer and delay the need to switch to other systemic options. We review the current data with regard to the use of SBRT for metastatic NSCLC and particularly oncogene-driven disease. Although there is great promise in the marriage of targeted therapies with SBRT, prospective data are urgently needed. In the meantime, such strategies are being used in carefully selected patients, with risk-adapted SBRT dose-fractionation regimens used to optimize the therapeutic index. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or SBRT-like treatments are increasingly being used for oligoprogression in patients with oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer. This approach allows patients to extend the duration of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and has the potential to prolong survival times. Careful patient selection and risk-adapted radiation dosing is of critical importance to minimize toxicity and preserve patient quality of life.}

METHODS: NO16966 was a randomised, two-arm, non-inferiority, phase III comparison of XELOX vs FOLFOX4, which was subsequently amended to a 2 × 2 factorial design with further randomisation to bevacizumab or placebo. A planned follow-up exploratory analysis of OS was performed. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised 2034 patients (two-arm portion, n=634; 2 × 2 factorial portion, n=1400). For the whole NO16966 study population, median OS was 19.8 months in the pooled XELOX/XELOX-placebo/XELOX-bevacizumab arms vs 19.5 months in the pooled FOLFOX4/FOLFOX4-placebo/FOLFOX4-bevacizumab arms (hazard ratio 0.95 (97.5\% CI 0.85-1.06)). In the pooled XELOX/XELOX-placebo arms, median OS was 19.0 vs 18.9 months in the pooled FOLFOX4/FOLFOX4-placebo arms (hazard ratio 0.95 (97.5\% CI 0.83-1.09)). FOLFOX4 was associated with more grade 3/4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia and febrile neutropenia than XELOX, and XELOX with more grade 3 diarrhoea and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome than FOLFOX4. CONCLUSION: Updated survival data from study NO16966 show that XELOX is similar to FOLFOX4, confirming the primary analysis of progression-free survival. XELOX can be considered as a routine first-line treatment option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {Immunotherapy is an ever-expanding field in lung cancer treatment research. Over the past two decades, there has been significant progress in identifying immunotherapy targets and creating specific therapeutic agents, leading to a major paradigm shift in lung cancer treatment. However, despite the great success achieved with programmed death protein 1/ligand 1 (PD-1/PDL1) monoclonal antibodies and with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), only a minority of lung cancer patients respond to treatment, and of these many subsequently experience disease progression. In addition, immune-related adverse events sometimes can be life-threatening, especially when anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 are used in combination. All of this prompted researchers to identify novel immune checkpoints targets to overcome these limitations. Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoglobulin (Ig) and Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-Based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) domain (TIGIT), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) are promising molecules now under investigation. This review aims to outline the current role of immunotherapy in lung cancer and to examine efficacy and future applications of the new immune regulating molecules.},

Multidisciplinary discussions of surgical resectability and medical operability determine the modality of definitive local treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) and the associated systemic therapies to further improve the likelihood of cure. Trial evidence supports cisplatin-based adjuvant therapy either after surgical resection or concurrently with radiotherapy. Consensus guidelines support neoadjuvant chemotherapy in lieu of adjuvant chemotherapy and carboplatin-based regimens for patients who are ineligible for cisplatin. The incorporation of newer agents, now standard for~patients with stage IV lung cancer, into the curative therapy paradigm has lagged owing to inefficient trial designs, the lengthy follow-up needed to assess survival end points and a developmental focus on the advanced-stage disease setting. Surrogate end points, such as pathological response, are being studied and might shorten trial durations. In 2018, the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab was approved for patients with stage III lung cancer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Since then, the study of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in patients with early-stage lung cancer has rapidly expanded. In this Review, we present the current considerations in the treatment of patients with early-stage lung cancer and explore the current and future state of clinical research to develop systemic therapies for non-metastatic lung cancer.},

NSCLC should now be further sub-classified by histology and driver mutation if one is known or present. Translational research advances now allow such mutations to be inhibited by either receptor monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Whilst empirical chemotherapy with a platinum-doublet remains the gold standard for advanced NSCLC without a known driver mutation, targeted therapy is pushing the boundary to significantly improve patient outcomes and quality of life. In this review, we will examine the major subtypes of oncogenic drivers behind NSCLC as well as the development of targeted agents available to treat them both now and in the foreseeable future.},

The approved indications were for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in a second or later relapse. Since then, extensive research activities have been ongoing globally on different hematologic and solid tumors to assess the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy for these diseases. Limitations to CAR-T therapy became apparent from, e.g., the relapse in up to 60\% of patients and certain side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This led to extensive clinical activities aimed at overcoming these obstacles, so that the use of CAR-T therapy can be expanded. Attempts to improve on efficacy and safety include changing the CAR-T administration schedule, combining it with chemotherapy, and the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies, e.g., through the use of CAR-natural killer (CAR-NK) and CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms). This review will focus on new CAR-T treatment strategies in hematologic malignancies, clinical trials aimed at improving efficacy and addressing side effects, the challenges that CAR-T therapy faces in solid tumors, and the ongoing research aimed at overcoming these challenges.},

EGFR C797S is the most notable resistance mechanism to this drug, but other EGFR mutations may also exist. In three lung adenocarcinoma patients resistant to osimertinib, we identified recurrent novel mutations at EGFR Leu792 codon by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of cell free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma or pleural effusion. In two cases with pre-treatment tumor samples tested, mutations at Leu792 were absent, indicating that they were newly acquired during the therapy. Interestingly, all Leu792 mutations are localized at the same gene allele as T790M, but different from C797S. Structural prediction suggests that Leu792 mutations could interrupt the binding of osimerbinib to EGFR and potentially cause drug resistance.}

Materials and Methods:~           To raise awareness of MTBs among health-care professionals, policymakers, and the public, a total of 20 experts from TOS and TSP formulated a joint consensus statement through a voting process.           Results:~           The joint statement proposes key recommendations: (1) MTB discussions encompass diverse molecular analyses including next-generation sequencing (NGS), RNA sequencing, whole-exon sequencing, and whole-genomic sequencing addressing relevant genomic changes, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, and specific biomarkers for certain cancers. (2) MTB meetings should involve multidisciplinary participants who receive regular updates on NGS-related clinical trials. (3) Prioritize discussing cases with unique clinical needs, gene alterations lacking treatments, untreatable neoplasms, or oncogenes unresponsive to targeted therapies. (4) Base MTB discussions on comprehensive patient data, including genetics, pathology, timing of specimen collection, and NGS outcomes. (5) MTBs offer treatment recommendations: standard therapies, off-label use, clinical trials, genetic counseling, and multidisciplinary reviews. (6) MTB effectiveness can be gauged by member composition, case reviews, treatment suggestions, and patient outcomes. Encourage government incentives for MTB engagement.           Conclusion:~           The primary aim of this initiative is to promote the advancement of precision oncology in Taiwan.},

We tested three antibodies to ALK, using various detection systems, and hypothesized that ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) may represent a cost-effective and efficient means of screening for ALK rearrangement in NSCLC. Methods We screened 377 stage I or II NSCLC cases in a tissue microarray by FISH and IHC (5A4 [Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, UYnited Kingdom] by Nichirei's N-Histofine ALK detection kit [Nichirei Biosciences inc., Tokyo, Japan], 5A4 by Novocastra with ADVANCE [Dako Canada inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada], D5F3 by Cell Signaling Technology with ADVANCE [Cell Signalling Technologies inc., Danvers, MA], and DAKO clone ALK1 with FLEX [Dako Canada inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada] and ADVANCE). IHC was scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+. Possibly positive or positive cases were further analyzed by IHC and FISH on whole section. Results Tissue microarray results were available on 377 cases by IHC and 273 cases by FISH. Eleven cases were positive or possibly positive by either IHC or FISH, and three cases were positive or possibly positive by both methods. Three cases were ALK-positive by FISH on whole section validation. There was no correlation between semiquantitative IHC score (1+, 2+, 3+) and ALK rearrangement by FISH. D5F3 (Cell Signaling by ADVANCE) and 5A4 (Novocastra by ADVANCE) showed the greatest combination of sensitivity (100\%) and specificity (87.5\% for 5A4 by Novocastra and 75\% for D5F3 by Cell Signaling), and produced no false-negative results. Conclusions IHC is a reliable screening tool for identification of ALK rearrangement in NSCLC and is antibody dependent. D5F3 (Cell Signaling) and 5A4 (Novocastra) can be used with FISH for identification of IHC-positive cases to reduce screening costs.},

  abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer, characterized by tumors that do not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or HER-2 genes, represents an important clinical challenge because these cancers do not respond to endocrine therapy or other available targeted agents. The metastatic potential in triple-negative breast cancer is similar to that of other breast cancer subtypes, but these tumors are associated with a shorter median time to relapse and death. One important goal is therefore the identification of prognostic factors and markers to reliably select high and low risk subsets of patients with triple-negative disease for different treatment approaches of subtypes with differential responsiveness to specific agents. However, a reliable prognostic marker has been elusive, and markers have been inconsistently useful. For example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been studied, but there is still a lack of agreement on a standard assay or cutoff for EGFR expression levels with respect to prognosis. Similarly, because triple-negative status is sometimes used as a surrogate for basal-like breast cancer, specific basal markers have been explored. Indeed, trials designed to accrue patients with basal-like breast cancer using ER/PR and HER-2 negativity may provide only an approximation of the triple-negative population and are sometimes reanalyzed using more specific indicators like CK 5/6, EGFR status, and others, again marred by discordances. Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, but important limitations still need to be overcome in the next few years if any significant clinical strides are to be made. Current treatment strategies for triple-negative disease include anthracyclines, taxanes, ixabepilone, platinum agents, and biologic agents. More recently, EGFR inhibition has been proposed as a therapeutic mechanism in triple-negative breast cancer, again with mixed results. Agents that target poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and androgen receptors have also been proposed in these patients or subsets of them, and ongoing trials should result in definitive guidance with respect to the value of these agents in triple-negative disease. Triple-negative breast cancer is clearly a distinct clinical subtype, from the perspective of both ER and HER-2 expression, but further subclassification is needed. At present, there is not a clear, proven effective single agent that targets a defining vulnerability in triple-negative breast cancer. This article will review the clinical problem of triple-negative disease, potential prognostic factors, demonstrated efficacy of currently available therapeutic options, and new potential therapies.}

To treat metastatic brain disease, blood�弎rain barrier (BBB) permeability is considered desirable for increasing clinical efficacy. Experimental Design: We examined the level of brain penetration for 16 irreversible and reversible EGFR-TKIs using multiple in vitro and in vivo BBB preclinical models. Results: In vitro osimertinib was the weakest substrate for human BBB efflux transporters (efflux ratio 3.2). In vivo rat free brain to free plasma ratios (Kpuu) show osimertinib has the most BBB penetrance (0.21), compared with the other TKIs (Kpuu �� 0.12). PET imaging in Cynomolgus macaques demonstrated osimertinib was the only TKI among those tested to achieve significant brain penetrance (Cmax \%ID 1.5, brain/blood Kp 2.6). Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy images of brains from mouse PC9 macrometastases models showed osimertinib readily distributes across both healthy brain and tumor tissue. Comparison of osimertinib with the poorly BBB penetrant afatinib in a mouse PC9 model of subclinical brain metastases showed only osimertinib has a significant effect on rate of brain tumor growth. Conclusions: These preclinical studies indicate that osimertinib can achieve significant exposure in the brain compared with the other EGFR-TKIs tested and supports the ongoing clinical evaluation of osimertinib for the treatment of EGFR-mutant brain metastasis. This work also demonstrates the link between low in vitro transporter efflux ratios and increased brain penetrance in vivo supporting the use of in vitro transporter assays as an early screen in drug discovery.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80\% of lung cancers, the second leading cause of cancer deaths globally. Mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are genomic drivers in a molecular sub-type of NSCLC that is sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Third-generation, irreversible TKIs, such as osimertinib and lazertinib, have become standard of care and are now widely used as first-line therapy in EGFR-driven metastatic NSCLC. However, resistance invariably arises during treatment. The C797S mutation is the most frequent on-target resistance mechanism in response to third-generation TKIs when used in the first-line setting. There are currently no approved therapies for patients who progress with a C797S mutation. Although first-generation TKIs inhibit EGFR with a C797S mutation, they carry liabilities of 1) insufficient selectivity over wild-type (WT) EGFR, which precludes maximal target coverage and results in dose-limiting adverse events; and 2) limited brain penetration. METHODS: BLU-701 activity was tested in biochemical assays for EGFR mutants and EGFR WT. Cellular activity was evaluated by a phosphorylation specific EGFR AlphaLisa assay in WT cell lines or those expressing EGFR mutations. The in vivo antitumor activity of BLU-701 was assessed in a PC9 ex19del cell line-derived tumor xenograft (CDX) model. RESULTS: We have developed an orally available, single-digit nanomolar, brain-penetrant, WT-sparing, reversible EGFR inhibitor that is active against the C797S resistance mutation. BLU-701 is equally potent against both the sensitizing mutations ex19del and L858R, and the resistance double mutants ex19del/C797S and L858R/C797S. BLU-701 is brain penetrant (Kpu,u {$>$}0.9) and demonstrates a selectivity over WT EGFR that compares favorably with osimertinib. Oral administration of BLU-701 to PC9 ex19del tumor-bearing mice resulted in strong and prolonged pathway suppression and tumor regression at tolerated doses. CONCLUSION: Due to its potent pharmacological activity and selectivity for mutant EGFR, BLU-701 has the potential to demonstrate activity in first-line and resistance settings as a single agent and in combination therapy, addressing potential tumor heterogeneity. The pre-clinical data described here supports the clinical development of BLU-701 in EGFR-driven NSCLC.

  abstract = {The discoveries of EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements as actionable oncogenic drivers in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has propelled a biomarker-directed treatment paradigm for patients with advanced-stage disease. Numerous EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with demonstrated efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant and ALK-rearranged NSCLCs have been developed, culminating in the availability of the highly effective third-generation TKIs osimertinib and lorlatinib, respectively. Despite their marked efficacy, resistance to these agents remains an unsolved fundamental challenge. Both ‘on-target’ mechanisms (largely mediated by acquired resistance mutations in the kinase domains of EGFR or ALK) and ‘off-target’ mechanisms of resistance (mediated by non-target kinase alterations such as bypass signalling activation or phenotypic transformation) have been identified in patients with disease progression on osimertinib or lorlatinib. A growing understanding of the biology and spectrum of these mechanisms of resistance has already begun to inform the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. In this Review, we discuss the development of third-generation EGFR and ALK inhibitors, predominant mechanisms of resistance, and approaches to tackling resistance in the clinic, ranging from novel fourth-generation TKIs to combination regimens and other investigational therapies.},

  abstract = {The clinical efficacy of EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib is limited by the development of drug resistance. The most common mechanism of drug resistance is the secondary EGFR T790M mutation. Strategies to overcome EGFR T790M-mediated drug resistance include the use of mutant selective EGFR inhibitors, including WZ4002, or the use of high concentrations of irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors such as PF299804. In the current study, we develop drug-resistant versions of the EGFR-mutant PC9 cell line, which reproducibly develops EGFR T790M as a mechanism of drug resistance to gefitinib. Neither PF299804-resistant nor WZ4002-resistant clones of PC9 harbor EGFR T790M. Instead, they have shown activated insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling as a result of loss of expression of IGFBP3 with the IGF1R inhibitor, BMS 536924, restoring EGFR inhibitor sensitivity. Intriguingly, prolonged exposure to either PF299804 or WZ4002 results in the emergence of a more drug-resistant subclone that exhibits ERK activation. A MEK inhibitor, CI-1040, partially restores sensitivity to the EGFR/IGF1R inhibitor combination. Moreover, an IGF1R or MEK inhibitor used in combination with either PF299804 or WZ4002 completely prevents the emergence of drug-resistant clones in this model system. Our studies suggest that more effective means of inhibiting EGFR T790M will prevent the emergence of this common drug resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. However, multiple drug resistance mechanisms can still emerge. Preventing the emergence of drug resistance, by targeting pathways that become activated in resistant cancers, may be a more effective clinical strategy.}

The safety and efficacy of durvalumab and gefitinib in combination for TKI-naive patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC was evaluated. Methods This Phase 1 open-label, multicentre trial (NCT02088112) was conducted in 56 patients with NSCLC. Dose expansion permitted TKI-naive patients, primarily with activating L858R or Ex19del EGFRm. Arms 1 + 1a received concurrent therapy; Arm 2 received 4 weeks of gefitinib induction followed by concurrent therapy. Results From dose escalation, the recommended dose of durvalumab was 10 mg/kg Q2W with 250 mg QD gefitinib. Pharmacokinetics were as expected, consistent with inhibition of soluble PD-L1 and no treatment-emergent immunogenicity. In dose expansion, 35\% of patients had elevated liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation. In Arms 1 + 1a, objective response rate was 63.3\% (95\% CI: 43.9-80.1), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.1 months (95\% CI: 5.5-15.2) and median response duration was 9.2 months (95\% CI: 3.7-14.0). Conclusions Durvalumab and gefitinib in combination had higher toxicity than either agent alone. No significant increase in PFS was detected compared with historical controls. Therefore, concurrent PD-L1 inhibitors with gefitinib should be generally avoided in TKI-naive patients with EGFRm NSCLC.}

Here, we describe a pharmacogenomic platform that facilitates rapid discovery of drug combinations that can overcome resistance. We established cell culture models derived from biopsy samples of lung cancer patients whose disease had progressed while on treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and then subjected these cells to genetic analyses and a pharmacological screen. Multiple effective drug combinations were identified. For example, the combination of ALK and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors was active in an ALK -positive resistant tumor that had developed a MAP2K1 activating mutation, and the combination of EGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors was active in an EGFR mutant resistant cancer with a mutation in FGFR3 . Combined ALK and SRC (pp60c-src) inhibition was effective in several ALK-driven patient-derived models, a result not predicted by genetic analysis alone. With further refinements, this strategy could help direct therapeutic choices for individual patients.}

  abstract = {Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged lung cancer is associated with significant response to crizotinib. However, resistance to crizotinib typically develops within 1-2 years. Preclinical studies and biopsies of resistant sites have demonstrated that diverse mechanisms underlie resistance. Insight into resistance mechanisms has facilitated development of next-generation inhibitors and led to therapeutic combination strategies, several of which are being tested in the clinic., In 2007, a chromosomal rearrangement resulting in a gene fusion leading to expression of a constitutively active anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein was identified as an oncogenic driver in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ALK rearrangements are detected in 3\%–7\% of patients with NSCLC and are particularly enriched in younger patients with adenocarcinoma and a never or light smoking history. Fortuitously, crizotinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor initially developed to target cMET, was able to be repurposed for ALK-rearranged (ALK+) NSCLC. Despite dramatic and durable initial responses to crizotinib; however, the vast majority of patients will develop resistance within a few years. Diverse molecular mechanisms underlie resistance to crizotinib. This review will describe the clinical activity of crizotinib, review identified mechanisms of crizotinib resistance, and end with a survey of emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming crizotinib resistance.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Most ALK-positive lung cancers will develop ALK-independent resistance after treatment with next-generation ALK inhibitors. MET amplification has been described in patients progressing on ALK inhibitors, but frequency of this event has not been comprehensively assessed. Experimental Design: We performed FISH and/or next-generation sequencing on 207 posttreatment tissue (n = 101) or plasma (n = 106) specimens from patients with ALK-positive lung cancer to detect MET genetic alterations. We evaluated ALK inhibitor sensitivity in cell lines with MET alterations and assessed antitumor activity of ALK/MET blockade in ALK-positive cell lines and 2 patients with MET-driven resistance. Results: MET amplification was detected in 15\% of tumor biopsies from patients relapsing on next-generation ALK inhibitors, including 12\% and 22\% of biopsies from patients progressing on second-generation inhibitors or lorlatinib, respectively. Patients treated with a second-generation ALK inhibitor in the first-line setting were more likely to develop MET amplification than those who had received next-generation ALK inhibitors after crizotinib (P = 0.019). Two tumor specimens harbored an identical ST7-MET rearrangement, one of which had concurrent MET amplification. Expressing ST7-MET in the sensitive H3122 ALK-positive cell line induced resistance to ALK inhibitors that was reversed with dual ALK/MET inhibition. MET inhibition resensitized a patient-derived cell line harboring both ST7-MET and MET amplification to ALK inhibitors. Two patients with ALK-positive lung cancer and acquired MET alterations achieved rapid responses to ALK/MET combination therapy. Conclusions: Treatment with next-generation ALK inhibitors, particularly in the first-line setting, may lead to MET-driven resistance. Patients with acquired MET alterations may derive clinical benefit from therapies that target both ALK and MET.}

  abstract = {Purpose: Acquired resistance to next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is often driven by secondary ALK mutations. Here, we investigated utility of plasma genotyping for identifying ALK resistance mutations at relapse on next-generation ALK TKIs. Experimental Design: We analyzed 106 plasma specimens from 84 patients with advanced ALK-positive lung cancer treated with second- and third-generation ALK TKIs using a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform (Guardant360). Tumor biopsies from TKI-resistant lesions underwent targeted NGS to identify ALK mutations. Results: By genotyping plasma, we detected an ALK mutation in 46 (66\%) of 70 patients relapsing on a second-generation ALK TKI. When post-alectinib plasma and tumor specimens were compared, there was no difference in frequency of ALK mutations (67\% vs. 63\%), but plasma specimens were more likely to harbor ��2 ALK mutations (24\% vs. 2\%, P = 0.004). Among 29 patients relapsing on lorlatinib, plasma genotyping detected an ALK mutation in 22 (76\%), including 14 (48\%) with ��2 ALK mutations. The most frequent combinations of ALK mutations were G1202R/L1196M and D1203N/1171N. Detection of ��2 ALK mutations was significantly more common in patients relapsing on lorlatinib compared with second-generation ALK TKIs (48\% vs. 23\%, P = 0.017). Among 15 patients who received lorlatinib after a second-generation TKI, serial plasma analysis demonstrated that eight (53\%) acquired ��1 new ALK mutations on lorlatinib. Conclusions: ALK resistance mutations increase with each successive generation of ALK TKI and may be underestimated by tumor genotyping. Sequential treatment with increasingly potent ALK TKIs may promote acquisition of ALK resistance mutations leading to treatment-refractory compound ALK mutations.}

  abstract = {Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung tumors initially respond to small-molecule ALK inhibitors, but drug resistance often develops. Of tumors that develop resistance to highly potent second-generation ALK inhibitors, approximately half harbor resistance mutations in ALK, while the other half have other mechanisms underlying resistance. Members of the latter group often have activation of at least one of several different tyrosine kinases driving resistance. Such tumors are not expected to respond to lorlatinib-a third-generation inhibitor targeting ALK that is able to overcome all clinically identified resistant mutations in ALK-and further therapeutic options are limited. Herein, we deployed a shRNA screen of 1,000 genes in multiple ALK-inhibitor-resistant patient-derived cells (PDCs) to discover those that confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition. This approach identified SHP2, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a common targetable resistance node in multiple PDCs. SHP2 provides a parallel survival input downstream of multiple tyrosine kinases that promote resistance to ALK inhibitors. Treatment with SHP099, the recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor of SHP2, in combination with the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) ceritinib halted the growth of resistant PDCs through preventing compensatory RAS and ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) reactivation. These findings suggest that combined ALK and SHP2 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for resistant cancers driven by several different ALK-independent mechanisms underlying resistance.}

These encouraging results lead to the first approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer and thus offer new therapeutic possibilities in aggressive tumors and hard-to-treat populations. Furthermore, several ongoing trials are investigating combining immunotherapies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional therapies and as well as with other immunotherapeutic strategies such as cancer vaccines, CAR-T cells, bispecific antibodies, and oncolytic viruses in all breast cancer subtypes. This review provides an overview of immunotherapies currently under clinical development and updated key results from clinical trials. Finally, we discuss the challenges to the successful implementation of immune treatment in managing breast cancer and their implications for the design of future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In a previous study of treatment for advanced colorectal cancer, the LV5FU2 regimen, comprising leucovorin (LV) plus bolus and infusional fluorouracil (5FU) every 2 weeks, was superior to the standard North Central Cancer Treatment Group/Mayo Clinic 5-day bolus 5FU/LV regimen. This phase III study investigated the effect of combining oxaliplatin with LV5FU2, with progression-free survival as the primary end point. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred twenty previously untreated patients with measurable disease were randomized to receive a 2-hour infusion of LV (200 mg/m(2)/d) followed by a 5FU bolus (400 mg/m(2)/d) and 22-hour infusion (600 mg/m(2)/d) for 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks, either alone or together with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour infusion on day 1. RESULTS: Patients allocated to oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2 had significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 9.0 v 6.2 months; P =.0003) and better response rate (50.7\% v 22.3\%; P =.0001) when compared with the control arm. The improvement in overall survival did not reach significance (median, 16.2 v 14.7 months; P =. 12). LV5FU2 plus oxaliplatin gave higher frequencies of National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia (41. 7\% v 5.3\% of patients), grade 3/4 diarrhea (11.9\% v 5.3\%), and grade 3 neurosensory toxicity (18.2\% v 0\%), but this did not result in impairment of quality of life (QoL). Survival without disease progression or deterioration in global health status was longer in patients allocated to oxaliplatin treatment (P =.004). CONCLUSION: The LV5FU2-oxaliplatin combination seems beneficial as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer, demonstrating a prolonged progression-free survival with acceptable tolerability and maintenance of QoL.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are effective therapies for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring EGFR-activating mutations, but are not curative due to the inevitable emergence of resistances. Recent in vitro studies suggest that resistance to EGFR-TKI may arise from a small population of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTP) through non-genetic reprogramming, by entering a reversible slow-to-non-proliferative state, before developing genetically derived resistances. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms governing the dynamics of the drug-tolerant state is therefore a priority to provide sustainable therapeutic solutions for patients. An increasing number of molecular mechanisms underlying DTP survival are being described, such as chromatin and epigenetic remodelling, the reactivation of anti-apoptotic/survival pathways, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with their micro-environment. Here, we review and discuss the existing proposed mechanisms involved in the DTP state. We describe their biological features, molecular mechanisms of tolerance, and the therapeutic strategies that are tested to target the DTP.},

METHODS               An Expert Panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review guided by a signals approach to identify new, potentially practice-changing data that might translate into revised guideline recommendations.                                         RESULTS               The Expert Panel reviewed abstracts from the literature review and identified one article for inclusion that reported results of the phase III, open-label KATHERINE trial. In the KATHERINE trial, patients with stage I to III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive breast cancer with residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy were allocated to adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; n = 743) or to trastuzumab (n = 743). Invasive disease–free survival was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab arm (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.64; P {$<$} .001), and risk of distant recurrence was lower in patients who received T-DM1 than in patients who received trastuzumab (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.79). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 190 patients (25.7\%) who received T-DM1 and in 111 patients (15.4\%) who received trastuzumab.                                         RECOMMENDATIONS               Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with pathologic invasive residual disease at surgery after standard preoperative chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy should be offered 14 cycles of adjuvant T-DM1, unless there is disease recurrence or unmanageable toxicity. Clinicians may offer any of the available and approved formulations of trastuzumab, including trastuzumab, trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk, and available biosimilars.

However, data showing the prevalence of the ALK rearrangement is still deficient and is not yet available in Indonesia. This study used direct smear preparation from transthoracic needle specimens that are minimally invasive. The main objective of the study is to identify the prevalence of the ALK fusion rearrangement gene in cytological specimens. Materials and methods A total of 35 direct smear preparations diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutation negative were involved in this study. The samples were taken between 2017 and 2019. These samples were examined for EML4-ALK fusion rearrangement gene using qRT-PCR. The EML4-ALK rearrangement status was determined by qRT-PCR with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Results A total of 28 (80\%) samples were from males, and 7 samples were from females. Seven (20\% 95\% CI: 8.4\%-36.9\%) samples were EML4-ALK rearrangement positive. The average age of the patients was 63.5 years old. The most common sites of metastasis in this study were pleural cavity, bone, liver, and CNS. Conclusions qRT-PCR successfully identified EML4-ALK fusion rearrangement in direct smear preparations of lung adenocarcinoma. Direct smear samples can be used for EML4-ALK rearrangement detection using qRT-PCR. The EML4-ALK rearrangement gene has high prevalence in selected lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutation-negative populations. ALK inhibitors in lung cancer can be openly considered for use in Indonesian patients to improve the outcome of this subset of patients.},

  abstract = {Determining the genetic basis of cancer requires comprehensive analyses of large collections of histopathologically well-classified primary tumours. Here we report the results of a collaborative study to discover somatic mutations in 188 human lung adenocarcinomas. DNA sequencing of 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more than 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples. Our analysis identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis. The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases, among them the EGFR homologue ERBB4; multiple ephrin receptor genes, notably EPHA3; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR; and NTRK genes. These data provide evidence of somatic mutations in primary lung adenocarcinoma for several tumour suppressor genes involved in other cancers--including NF1, APC, RB1 and ATM--and for sequence changes in PTPRD as well as the frequently deleted gene LRP1B. The observed mutational profiles correlate with clinical features, smoking status and DNA repair defects. These results are reinforced by data integration including single nucleotide polymorphism array and gene expression array. Our findings shed further light on several important signalling pathways involved in lung adenocarcinoma, and suggest new molecular targets for treatment.}

  abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made in the development of biomarker-driven targeted therapies for patients with multiple cancer types, including melanoma, breast and lung tumours, although precision oncology for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to lag behind. Nonetheless, the availability of patient-derived CRC models coupled with in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and functional analyses over the past decade has finally led to advances in the field. Gene-specific alterations are not the only determinants that can successfully direct the use of targeted therapy. Indeed, successful inhibition of BRAF or KRAS in metastatic CRCs driven by activating mutations in these genes requires combinations of drugs that inhibit the mutant protein while at the same time restraining adaptive resistance via CRC-specific EGFR-mediated feedback loops. The emerging paradigm is, therefore, that the intrinsic biology of CRC cells must be considered alongside the molecular profiles of individual tumours in order to successfully personalize treatment. In this Review, we outline how preclinical studies based on patient-derived models have informed the design of practice-changing clinical trials. The integration of these experiences into a common framework will reshape the future design of biology-informed clinical trials in this field.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) gene rearrangements often manifest dramatic responses to crizotinib, a small-molecule ALK inhibitor. Unfortunately, not every patient responds and acquired drug resistance inevitably develops in those who do respond. This study aimed to define molecular mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib in patients with ALK + non�𦽳mall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Experimental Design: We analyzed tissue obtained from 14 patients with ALK + NSCLC showing evidence of radiologic progression while on crizotinib to define mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance to crizotinib. Results: Eleven patients had material evaluable for molecular analysis. Four patients (36\%) developed secondary mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK . A novel mutation in the ALK domain, encoding a G1269A amino acid substitution that confers resistance to crizotinib in vitro , was identified in two of these cases. Two patients, one with a resistance mutation, exhibited new onset ALK copy number gain (CNG). One patient showed outgrowth of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutant NSCLC without evidence of a persistent ALK gene rearrangement. Two patients exhibited a KRAS mutation, one of which occurred without evidence of a persisting ALK gene rearrangement. One patient showed the emergence of an ALK gene fusion�忛egative tumor compared with the baseline sample but with no identifiable alternate driver. Two patients retained ALK positivity with no identifiable resistance mechanism. Conclusions: Crizotinib resistance in ALK + NSCLC occurs through somatic kinase domain mutations, ALK gene fusion CNG, and emergence of separate oncogenic drivers.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Panitumumab Randomized trial In combination with chemotherapy for Metastatic colorectal cancer to determine Efficacy (PRIME) demonstrated that panitumumab-FOLFOX4 significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) versus FOLFOX4 as first-line treatment of wild-type (WT) KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the primary end point of the study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to panitumumab 6.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks + FOLFOX4 (arm 1) or FOLFOX4 (arm 2). This prespecified final descriptive analysis of efficacy and safety was planned for 30 months after the last patient was enrolled. RESULTS: A total of 1183 patients were randomized. Median PFS for WT KRAS mCRC was 10.0 months [95\% confidence interval (CI) 9.3-11.4 months] for arm 1 and 8.6 months (95\% CI 7.5-9.5 months) for arm 2; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.80; 95\% CI 0.67-0.95; P = 0.01. Median overall survival (OS) for WT KRAS mCRC was 23.9 months (95\% CI 20.3-27.7 months) for arm 1 and 19.7 months (95\% CI 17.6-22.7 months) for arm 2; HR = 0.88; 95\% CI 0.73-1.06; P = 0.17 (68\% OS events). An exploratory analysis of updated survival ({$>$}80\% OS events) was carried out which demonstrated improvement in OS; HR = 0.83; 95\% CI 0.70-0.98; P = 0.03 for WT KRAS mCRC. The adverse event profile was consistent with the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In WT KRAS mCRC, PFS was improved, objective response was higher, and there was a trend toward improved OS with panitumumab-FOLFOX4, with significant improvement in OS observed in an updated analysis of survival in patients with WT KRAS mCRC treated with panitumumab + FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 alone (P = 0.03). These data support a positive benefit-risk profile for panitumumab-FOLFOX4 for patients with previously untreated WT KRAS mCRC. KRAS testing is critical to select appropriate patients for treatment with panitumumab.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that harbors KRAS mutations in exon 2 do not benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy. Other activating RAS mutations may also be negative predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy. METHODS: In this prospective-retrospective analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of panitumumab plus oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) as compared with FOLFOX4 alone, according to RAS (KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF mutation status. A total of 639 patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutations in exon 2 had results for at least one of the following: KRAS exon 3 or 4; NRAS exon 2, 3, or 4; or BRAF exon 15. The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90\%. RESULTS: Among 512 patients without RAS mutations, progression-free survival was 10.1 months with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 versus 7.9 months with FOLFOX4 alone (hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy, 0.72; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.90; P=0.004). Overall survival was 26.0 months in the panitumumab-FOLFOX4 group versus 20.2 months in the FOLFOX4-alone group (hazard ratio for death, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.62 to 0.99; P=0.04). A total of 108 patients (17\%) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations. These mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival and overall survival with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 treatment, which was consistent with the findings in patients with KRAS mutations in exon 2. BRAF mutations were a negative prognostic factor. No new safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Additional RAS mutations predicted a lack of response in patients who received panitumumab-FOLFOX4. In patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without RAS mutations, improvements in overall survival were observed with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy.

We investigated the efficacy of these two agents combined for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: 387 patients previously untreated with chemotherapy (other than adjuvant) for advanced colorectal cancer were randomly assigned open-label irinotecan plus fluorouracil and calcium folinate (irinotecan group, n=199) or fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone (no-irinotecan group, n=188). Infusion schedules were once weekly or every 2 weeks, and were chosen by each centre. We assessed response rates and time to progression, and also response duration, survival, and quality of life. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population and on evaluable patients. FINDINGS: The response rate was significantly higher in patients in the irinotecan group than in those in the no-irinotecan group (49 vs 31\%, p{$<$}0.001 for evaluable patients, 35 vs 22\%, p{$<$}0.005 by intention to treat). Time to progression was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group (median 6.7 vs 4.4 months, p{$<$}0.001), and overall survival was higher (median 17.4 vs 14.1 months, p=0.031). Some grade 3 and 4 toxic effects were significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group, but effects were predictible, reversible, non-cumulative, and manageable. INTERPRETATION: Irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate was well-tolerated and increased response rate, time to progression, and survival, with a later deterioration in quality of life. This combination should be considered as a reference first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {The proto-oncogene ROS1 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase with an unknown physiological role in humans. Somatic chromosomal fusions involving ROS1 produce chimeric oncoproteins that drive a diverse range of cancers in adult and paediatric patients. ROS1-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are therapeutically active against these cancers, although only early-generation multikinase inhibitors have been granted regulatory approval, specifically for the treatment of ROS1 fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancers; histology-agnostic approvals have yet to be granted. Intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms of resistance to ROS1 TKIs can emerge in patients. Potential factors that influence resistance acquisition include the subcellular localization of the particular ROS1 oncoprotein and the TKI properties such as the preferential kinase conformation engaged and the spectrum of targets beyond ROS1. Importantly, the polyclonal nature of resistance remains underexplored. Higher-affinity next-generation ROS1 TKIs developed to have improved intracranial activity and to mitigate ROS1-intrinsic resistance mechanisms have demonstrated clinical efficacy in these regards, thus highlighting the utility of sequential ROS1 TKI therapy. Selective ROS1 inhibitors have yet to be developed, and thus the specific adverse effects of ROS1 inhibition cannot be deconvoluted from the toxicity profiles of the available multikinase inhibitors. Herein, we discuss the non-malignant and malignant biology of ROS1, the diagnostic challenges that ROS1 fusions present and the strategies to target ROS1 fusion proteins in both treatment-naive and acquired-resistance settings.},

Methods A global, multi-institutional registry (cohort A, n = 114) and a bi-institutional data set (cohort B, n = 71) of RET-rearranged lung cancer patients were analyzed. Patients were eligible if they had stage IV lung cancers harboring a RET rearrangement by local testing. The incidence of brain metastases and outcomes with multikinase inhibitor therapy were determined. Results The frequency of brain metastases at the time of diagnosis of stage IV disease was 25\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 18\%��32\%) in all patients from both cohorts. The lifetime prevalence of brain metastasis in stage IV disease was 46\% (95\% CI: 34\%��58\%) in patients for whom longitudinal data was available. The cumulative incidence of brain metastases was significantly different (p = 0.0039) between RET-, ROS1-, and ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)�𩂈earranged lung cancers, with RET intermediate between the other two groups. Although intracranial response data was not available in cohort A, the median progression-free survival of multikinase inhibitor therapy (cabozantinib, vandetanib, or sunitinib) in patients with brain metastases was 2.1 months (95\% CI: 1.3��2.9 months, n = 10). In cohort B, an intracranial response was observed in 2 of 11 patients (18\%) treated with cabozantinib, vandetanib (簣 everolimus), ponatinib, or alectinib; the median overall progression-free survival (intracranial and extracranial) was 3.9 months (95\% CI: 2.0��4.9 months). Conclusions Brain metastases occur frequently in RET-rearranged lung cancers, and outcomes with multikinase inhibitor therapy in general are suboptimal. Novel RET-directed targeted therapy strategies are needed.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}With therapeutic approaches based on oncogene addiction offering significant anticancer benefit, the identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (\emph{ALK}) rearrangements is a key aspect of the management of lung cancers. The \emph{EML4-ALK} gene fusion is detected in 4–8\% of all lung cancers, predominantly in light smokers or nonsmokers. Crizotinib, the first agent to be approved in this indication, is associated with a median progression-free survival of 10.9 months when given as first-line treatment and 7.7 months when administered after chemotherapy. Median overall survival with crizotinib in the second-line setting is 20.3 months. Second-generation ALK inhibitors are currently being evaluated, with early studies giving impressive results, notably in patients resistant to crizotinib or with brain metastases. Among available chemotherapies, pemetrexed appears to be particularly active in this population. Despite this progress, several questions remain unanswered. What detection strategies should be favoured? What underlies the mechanisms of resistance and what options are available to overcome them? What are the best approaches for progressing patients?

As the technology to produce these complex therapeutics has matured, many more ADCs have been approved or are in late-phase clinical trials. The diversification of antigenic targets as well as bioactive payloads is rapidly broadening the scope of tumour indications for ADCs. Moreover, novel vector protein formats as well as warheads targeting the tumour microenvironment are expected to improve the intratumour distribution or activation of ADCs, and consequently their anticancer activity for difficult-to-treat tumour types. However, toxicity remains a key issue in the development of these agents, and better understanding and management of ADC-related toxicities will be essential for further optimization. This Review provides a broad overview of the recent advances and challenges in ADC development for cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {Resistance to targeted EGFR inhibitors is likely to develop in EGFR mutant lung cancers. Early identification of innate or acquired resistance mechanisms to these agents is essential to direct development of future therapies. We describe the detection of heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance within populations of EGFR mutant cells (PC9 and/or NCI-H1975) with acquired resistance to current and newly developed EGFR TKIs including AZD9291. We report the detection of NRAS mutations, including a novel E63K mutation, and a gain of copy number of WT NRAS or WT KRAS in cell populations resistant to gefitinib, afatinib, WZ4002 or AZD9291. Compared to parental cells, a number of resistant cell populations were more sensitive to inhibition by the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) when treated in combination with the originating EGFR inhibitor. In vitro, a combination of AZD9291 with selumetinib prevented emergence of resistance in PC9 cells and delayed resistance in NCI-H1975 cells. In vivo, concomitant dosing of AZD9291 with selumetinib caused regression of AZD9291-resistant tumours in an EGFRm/T790M transgenic model. Our data support the use of a combination of AZD9291 with a MEK inhibitor to delay or prevent resistance to AZD9291 in EGFRm and/or EGFRm/T790M tumours. Further, these findings suggest that NRAS modifications in tumour samples from patients who have progressed on current or EGFR inhibitors in development may support subsequent treatment with a combination of EGFR and MEK inhibition.}

  abstract = {Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (ALK+ NSCLC) is a model disease for the use of targeted pharmaceuticals in thoracic oncology. Due to higher systemic and intracranial efficacy, the second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) alectinib and brigatinib have irrevocably displaced crizotinib as standard first-line treatment, based on the results of the ALEX and ALTA-1L trials. Besides, lorlatinib and brigatinib are the preferred second-line therapies for progression under second-generation TKI and crizotinib, respectively, based on the results of several phase II studies. Tissue or liquid rebiopsies at the time of disease progression, even though not mandated by the approval status of any ALK inhibitor, are gaining importance for individualization and optimization of patient management. Of particular interest are cases with off-target resistance, for example MET, HER2 or KRAS alterations, which require special therapeutic maneuvers, e.g., inclusion in early clinical trials or off-label administration of respectively targeted drugs. On the other hand, up to approximately half of the patients failing TKI, develop anatomically restricted progression, which can be initially tackled with local ablative measures without switch of systemic therapy. Among the overall biologically favorable ALK+ tumors, with a mean tumor mutational burden uniquely below 3 mutations per Mb and the longest survival among NSCLC currently, presence of the EML4-ALK fusion variant 3 and/or TP53 mutations identify high-risk cases with earlier treatment failure and a need for more aggressive surveillance and treatment strategies. The potential clinical utility of longitudinal ctDNA assays for earlier detection of disease progression and improved guidance of therapy in these patients is a currently a matter of intense investigation. Major pharmaceutical challenges for the field are the development of more potent, fourth-generation TKI and effective immuno-oncological interventions, especially ALK-directed cell therapies, which will be essential for further improving survival and achieving cure of ALK+ tumors.},

Here, we describe a gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line that developed resistance to gefitinib as a result of focal amplification of the MET proto-oncogene. inhibition of MET signaling in these cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib. MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 (22\%) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. We find that amplification of MET causes gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3 (HER3)�𡞫ependent activation of PI3K, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB family receptors. Thus, we propose that MET amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers as well.}

However, little is known about how cancers develop acquired resistance to this class of EGFR inhibitors. We sought to identify and study EGFR mutations that confer resistance to this class of agents. Experimental Design: We performed an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in EGFR -mutant (sensitizing alone or with concurrent EGFR T790M) Ba/F3 cells and selected drug-resistant clones. We evaluated the sensitivity of EGFR inhibitors in models harboring drug-resistant EGFR mutations. Results: We identified 3 major drug resistance mutations. EGFR L718Q, L844V, and C797S cause resistance to both WZ4002 and CO-1686 while, in contrast, only EGFR C797S leads to AZD9291 resistance. Cells containing an EGFR -sensitizing mutation, Del 19 or L858R, in conjunction with L718Q, L844V, or C797S retain sensitivity to quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib and afatinib. The C797S mutation, in the presence of Del 19 or L858R and T790M, causes resistance to all current EGFR inhibitors, but L858R/T790M/C797S remains partially sensitive to cetuximab which leads to disruption of EGFR dimerization. Conclusions: Our findings provide insights into resistance mechanisms to irreversible pyrimidine-based EGFR inhibitors and identify specific genomic contexts in which sensitivity is retained to existing clinical EGFR inhibitors. These findings will guide the development of new strategies to inhibit EGFR. Clin Cancer Res; 21(17); 3913��23. 穢2015 AACR . See related commentary by Ayeni et al., p. 3818}

The irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor WZ4002 is effective against the most common mechanism of drug resistance mediated by the EGFR T790M mutation. Here, we show, in multiple complementary models, that resistance to WZ4002 develops through aberrant activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling caused by either an amplification of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) or by downregulation of negative regulators of ERK signaling. Inhibition of MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) or ERK restores sensitivity to WZ4002 and prevents the emergence of drug resistance. We further identify MAPK1 amplification in an erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung carcinoma patient. In addition, the WZ4002-resistant MAPK1-amplified cells also show an increase both in EGFR internalization and a decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our findings provide insights into mechanisms of drug resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors and highlight rational combination therapies that should be evaluated in clinical trials.}

We compared ultrasensitive automated IHC with FISH for detecting ALK status on 318 FFPE and 40 matched ThinPrep specimens from 296 patients with advanced NSCLC. IHC was concordant with FFPE-FISH on 229 of 231 dual-informative samples (31 positive and 198 negative) and with ThinPrep-FISH on 34 of 34 samples (5 positive and 29 negative). Two cases with negative IHC and borderline-positive FFPE-FISH (15\% and 18\%, respectively) were reclassified as concordant based on negative matched ThinPrep-FISH and clinical data consistent with ALK-negative status. Overall, after including ThinPrep-FISH and amending the false-positive FFPE-FISH results, IHC demonstrated 100\% sensitivity and specificity (95\% CI, 0.86 to 1.00 and 0.97 to 1.00, respectively) for ALK detection on 249 dual-informative NSCLC samples. IHC was informative on significantly more samples than FFPE-FISH, revealing additional ALK-positive cases.

For the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, improved response rates and prolonged survival have been reported when irinotecan or oxaliplatin was added to 5-FU/FA; a further increase in efficacy was shown when bevacizumab, an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor, was added to chemotherapy. Studies investigating the substitution of infusional 5-FU with oral compounds in combination therapy (e.g. FOLFOX versus capecitabine/oxaliplatin) are ongoing, but preliminary results in metastatic patients advise caution because of increased toxicity when used with irinotecan, and statistically non-significant trends of a decreased efficacy when used with oxaliplatin. Therefore, the combined use of oral 5-FU prodrugs plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin is not recommended at present. Oral 5-FU prodrugs, however, offer a convenient and less toxic treatment option in adjuvant treatment and in the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma in patients who do not want an intensified regimen, those that have contraindications for implanted venous access devices, and those who are not candidates for a combination therapy with irinotecan and oxaliplatin.},

METHODS: Selection criteria included unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, age 18 to 75 years, and no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. The primary end point was response rate (RR). RESULTS: A total of 244 patients were randomly assigned. An increase of grade 2 to 3 peripheral neurotoxicity (0\% v 19\%; P {$<$} .001), and grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (28\% v 50\%; P {$<$} .001) were observed in the FOLFOXIRI arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (3\% v 5\%) and grade 3 to 4 diarrhea (12\% v 20\%) were not significantly different. Responses, as assessed by investigators, were, for FOLFIRI and FOLFOXIRI, respectively, complete, 6\% and 8\%; and partial, 35\% and 58\%, (RR, 41\% v 66\%; P = .0002). RR confirmed by an external panel was 34\% versus 60\% (P {$<$} .0001). The R0 secondary resection rate of metastases was greater in the FOLFOXIRI arm (6\% v 15\%; P = .033, among all 244 patients; and 12\% v 36\%; P = .017 among patients with liver metastases only). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were both significantly improved in the FOLFOXIRI arm (median PFS, 6.9 v 9.8 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; P = .0006; median OS, 16.7 v 22.6 months; HR, 0.70; P = .032). CONCLUSION: The FOLFOXIRI regimen improves RR, PFS, and OS compared with FOLFIRI, with an increased, but manageable, toxicity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with favorable prognostic characteristics. Further studies of FOLFOXIRI in combination with targeted agents and in the neoadjuvant setting are warranted.},

  abstract = {In ��30\% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas whose disease progresses on EGFR inhibitors, the basis for acquired resistance remains unclear. We have integrated transposon mutagenesis screening in an EGFR-mutant cell line and clinical genomic sequencing in cases of acquired resistance to identify mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. The most prominent candidate genes identified by insertions in or near the genes during the screen were MET, a gene whose amplification is known to mediate resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and the gene encoding the Src family kinase YES1. Cell clones with transposon insertions that activated expression of YES1 exhibited resistance to all three generations of EGFR inhibitors and sensitivity to pharmacologic and siRNA-mediated inhibition of YES1 Analysis of clinical genomic sequencing data from cases of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors revealed amplification of YES1 in five cases, four of which lacked any other known mechanisms of resistance. Preinhibitor samples, available for two of the five patients, lacked YES1 amplification. None of 136 postinhibitor samples had detectable amplification of other Src family kinases (SRC and FYN). YES1 amplification was also found in 2 of 17 samples from ALK fusion-positive lung cancer patients who had progressed on ALK TKIs. Taken together, our findings identify acquired amplification of YES1 as a recurrent and targetable mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibition in EGFR-mutant lung cancers and demonstrate the utility of transposon mutagenesis in discovering clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance.}

After many years of disappointing results, the tide has finally changed and immunotherapy has become a clinically validated treatment for many cancers. Immunotherapeutic strategies include cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, adoptive transfer of ex vivo activated T and natural killer cells, and administration of antibodies or recombinant proteins that either costimulate cells or block the so-called immune checkpoint pathways. The recent success of several immunotherapeutic regimes, such as monoclonal antibody blocking of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), has boosted the development of this treatment modality, with the consequence that new therapeutic targets and schemes which combine various immunological agents are now being described at a breathtaking pace. In this review, we outline some of the main strategies in cancer immunotherapy (cancer vaccines, adoptive cellular immunotherapy, immune checkpoint blockade, and oncolytic viruses) and discuss the progress in the synergistic design of immune-targeting combination therapies.}

In a subgroup of these patients we identified an association between selection of EGFRT790M-negative but EGFRG724S-positive subclones and osimertinib resistance. We demonstrate that EGFRG724S limits the activity of third-generation EGFR inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. Structural analyses and computational modeling indicate that EGFRG724S mutations may induce a conformation of the glycine-rich loop, which is incompatible with the binding of third-generation TKIs. Systematic inhibitor screening and in-depth kinetic profiling validate these findings and show that second-generation EGFR inhibitors retain kinase affinity and overcome EGFRG724S-mediated resistance. In the case of afatinib this profile translates into a robust reduction of colony formation and tumor growth of EGFRG724S-driven cells. Our data provide a mechanistic basis for the osimertinib-induced selection of EGFRG724S-mutant clones and a rationale to treat these patients with clinically approved second-generation EGFR inhibitors.}

We assessed the safety and activity of ceritinib plus nivolumab in these patients. Methods In this open-label, phase 1B, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study, previously treated (with ALK receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] inhibitor [ALKI]/chemotherapy) or treatment-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV ALK-rearranged NSCLC received nivolumab, 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, plus ceritinib, 450 mg/300 mg daily, with a low-fat meal. Results In total, 36 patients were treated (a 450-mg cohort [n=14] and a 300-mg cohort [n=22]). In the 450-mg cohort, four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. In the 300-mg cohort, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. Among ALKI-naive patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 83\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 35.9��99.6) in the 450-mg cohort and 60\% (95\% CI: 26.2��87.8) in the 300-mg cohort. Among ALKI-pretreated patients, the ORR was 50\% (95\% CI: 15.7��84.3) in the 450-mg cohort and 25\% (95\% CI: 5.5��57.2) in the 300-mg cohort. The ORR point estimate was observed to be greater in patients who were positive for PD-L1 than in those who were negative for PD-L1, with overlapping CIs (e.g., at a cutoff ��1\% PD-L1, 64\% of patients [95\% CI: 35.1��87.2] had confirmed responses as compared with those with negative PD-L1 staining (31\% [95\% CI: 11.0��58.7]). The most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase level (25\%), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase level (22\%), increased amylase level (14\%), increased lipase level (11\%), and maculopapular rash (11\%). The incidence of all-grade rash (grouped term) was 64\% in both cohorts; grade 3 rash was reported in 29\% and 14\% of patients in the 450-mg and 300-mg cohorts, respectively; no grade 4 rash was reported. Conclusion Ceritinib plus nivolumab has activity; ORR appears to correlate with PD-L1 at baseline. Toxicity, especially rash, is more common than with either single agent.}

Latest guidelines from the College of American Pathologist and the European society of medical oncologists indicate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement testing is standard practice. Historically, diagnostics for ALK used fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH); however, immunohistochemical (IHC) assays are becoming common practice. Unfortunately, recent assessment of current practice indicated that not all patients who should be tested for ALK translocation are undergoing ALK testing. Methods From a series of European and Israeli labs, we collected patients with discordant IHC and FISH testing, which were subsequently treated with ALK-targeted therapy, for discussion of the question, to treat or not to treat? Results Our study may support ALK IHC testing as a better predictor of response to targeted therapy provided that the labs implement controlled preanalytical procedures, use correct clone, run protocols on automated staining platforms and validate using external quality assessments.}

They allow to map the difference in importance as well as the relationship between the various research questions onto an adequate multiple test procedure. Since these procedures rely on the closed test principle, they usually require the explicit specification of a large number of intersection hypotheses tests. The underlying test strategy may therefore be difficult to communicate. We propose a simple iterative graphical approach to construct and perform such Bonferroni-type tests. The resulting multiple test procedures are represented by directed, weighted graphs, where each node corresponds to an elementary hypothesis, together with a simple algorithm to generate such graphs while sequentially testing the individual hypotheses. The approach is illustrated with the visualization of several common gatekeeping strategies. A case study is used to illustrate how the methods from this article can be used to tailor a multiple test procedure to given study objectives.}

  abstract = {Protein tyrosine kinases of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family, including EGFR and HER2, have emerged as important therapeutic targets in non-small-cell lung, breast and gastroesophageal cancers, and are of relevance for the treatment of various other malignancies (particularly colorectal cancer). Classic activating EGFR exon 19 deletions and exon 21 mutations, and HER2 amplification and/or overexpression, are predictive of response to matched molecularly targeted therapies, translating into favourable objective response rates and survival outcomes. By comparison, cancers with insertion mutations in exon 20 of either EGFR or HER2 are considerably less sensitive to the currently available tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibodies targeting these receptors. These exon 20 insertions are structurally distinct from other EGFR and HER2 mutations, providing an explanation for this lack of sensitivity. In this Review, we first discuss the prevalence and pan-cancer distribution of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertions, their biology and detection, and associated responses to current molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies. We then focus on novel approaches that are being developed to more effectively target tumours driven by these non-classic EGFR and HER2 alterations.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 430 previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI (n = 144), mIFL (n = 141), or CapeIRI (n = 145). Patients were concurrently randomly assigned to a double-blind treatment with celecoxib or placebo. After a protocol amendment, an additional 117 patients were randomly assigned to either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (FOLFIRI+Bev; n = 57) or mILF plus bevacizumab (mIFL+Bev; n = 60), whereas the CapeIRI arm was discontinued. The primary study end point was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary end points of overall survival (OS), response rate, and toxicity. RESULTS: Median PFS was 7.6 months for FOLFIRI, 5.9 months for mIFL (P = .004 for the comparison with FOLFIRI), and 5.8 months for CapeIRI (P = .015). Median OS was 23.1 months for FOLFIRI, 17.6 months for mIFL (P = .09), and 18.9 months for CapeIRI (P = .27). CapeIRI was associated with higher rates of severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. After the amendment to add bevacizumab, the median survival time has not yet been reached for FOLFIRI+Bev and was 19.2 months for mIFL+Bev (P = .007). FOLFIRI+Bev was associated with a higher rate of {$>$} or = grade 3 hypertension than mIFL+Bev. CONCLUSION: FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI+Bev offered superior activity to their comparators and were comparably safe. An infusional schedule of FU should be the preferred irinotecan-based regimen in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer.},

A biopsy of the primary lesion confirmed an ALK rearrangement; however, the tumor had transformed histologically into small cell lung cancer. The lack of reports of small cell lung cancer transformation in ALK-positive patients implies that this outcome was unusual; this patient was treated with alectinib, which is more selective and has a greater inhibitory effect than crizotinib. This case may reveal resistance mechanisms that differ according to the agent used for treatment.}

Recently, rearrangements involving ALK and the echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene were described as a specific genetic alteration in about 6\% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the expression of EML4-ALK mRNA and protein in 51 reactive and 58 neoplastic lymphoid tissues. EML4-ALK transcripts were detected in 3/51 (5.9\%) of reactive lymphoid tissues and 12/58 (20.7\%) of lymphomas of different categories, including follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin�䏭 disease. Notably, none of these cases expressed the EML4-ALK fusion protein at Western blotting samples and immunohistochemistry. These results indicate that EML4-ALK rearrangements are not specific of NSCLC and raise yet unsolved questions about their role in promoting human neoplasms.}

  abstract = {Advanced, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lung cancer is currently treated with the first-generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib followed by more potent, second-generation ALK inhibitors (e.g., ceritinib, alectinib) upon progression. Second-generation inhibitors are generally effective even in the absence of crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, likely reflecting incomplete inhibition of ALK by crizotinib in many cases. Herein, we analyzed 103 repeat biopsies from ALK-positive patients progressing on various ALK inhibitors. We find that each ALK inhibitor is associated with a distinct spectrum of ALK resistance mutations and that the frequency of one mutation - ALK G1202R - increases significantly after treatment with second-generation agents. To investigate strategies to overcome resistance to second-generation ALK inhibitors, we examine the activity of the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib in a series of ceritinib-resistant, patient-derived cell lines, and observe that the presence of ALK resistance mutations is highly predictive for sensitivity to lorlatinib, whereas those cell lines without ALK mutations are resistant.}

Both patients were dose-escalated to alectinib 900 mg twice daily, resulting in repeat clinical and radiographic responses.

Experimental Design: We identified 58 patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Objective response rates (ORRs) were assessed using RECIST v1.1. PD-L1 expression and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results: Objective responses were observed in 1/28 (3.6\%) EGFR-mutant or ALK-positive patients versus 7/30 (23.3\%) EGFR wild-type and ALK-negative/unknown patients (P = 0.053). The ORR among never- or light- (\{less than or equal to\}10 pack years) smokers was 4.2\% versus 20.6\% among heavy smokers (P = 0.123). In an independent cohort of advanced, EGFR-mutant (N=68) and ALK-positive (N=27) patients, PD-L1 expression was observed in 24\%/16\%/11\% and 63\%/47\%/26\% of pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) biopsies using cutoffs of \{greater than or equal to\}1\%, \{greater than or equal to\}5\% and \{greater than or equal to\}50\% tumor cell staining, respectively. Among EGFR-mutant patients with paired, pre- and post-TKI resistant biopsies (N=57), PD-L1 expression levels changed after resistance in 16 (28\%) patients. Concurrent PD-L1 expression (\{greater than or equal to\}5\%) and high levels of CD8+ TILs (grade \{greater than or equal to\}2) were observed in only 1 pre-treatment (2.1\%) and 5 resistant (11.6\%) EGFR-mutant specimens, and was not observed in any ALK-positive, pre- or post-TKI specimens. Conclusions: NSCLCs harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements are associated with low ORRs to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Low rates of concurrent PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TILs within the tumor microenvironment may underlie these clinical observations.}

Assay interpretation can be technically challenging, and either splitting of the 5' and 3' probes or loss of the 5' probe constitute rearrangement. We hypothesized that there may be clinical differences depending on rearrangement pattern on FISH. Methods An IRB-approved database of NSCLC patients at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute was queried for ALK rearrangement. Clinical characteristics and response to crizotinib were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) were obtained when available. Results Of 1614 NSCLC patients with ALK testing, 82 patients (5.1\%) had ALK rearrangement by FISH: 30 patients with split signals, 25 patients with 5' deletion, and 27 patients with details unavailable. Patients with 5' deletion were older ( p = 0.01) and tended to have more extensive smoking histories ( p = 0.08). IHC was positive for ALK rearrangement in all 27 patients with FISH split signals, whereas three of 21 patients with FISH 5' deletion had negative IHC (p = 0.05). Targeted NGS on two of three cases with discordant FISH and IHC results did not identify ALK rearrangement, instead finding driver mutations in EGFR and KRAS. Patients with 5' deletion treated with crizotinib had a smaller magnitude of tumor response ( p = 0.03). Conclusions Patients with 5' deletion on ALK FISH harbor features less typical of ALK -rearranged tumors, potentially indicating that some cases with this variant are false positives. Corroborative testing with IHC or NGS may be beneficial.}

Somatic activating mutations of the EGFR gene, increased gene copy number and certain clinical and pathological features have been associated with dramatic tumor responses and favorable clinical outcomes with these agents in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The specific types of activating mutations that confer sensitivity to EGFR TKIs are present in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the EGFR gene. Exon 19 deletion mutations and the single-point substitution mutation L858R in exon 21 are the most frequent in NSCLC and are termed 'classical' mutations. The NSCLC tumors insensitive to EGFR TKIs include those driven by the KRAS and MET oncogenes. Most patients who initially respond to gefitinib and erlotinib eventually become resistant and experience progressive disease. The point mutation T790M accounts for about one half of these cases of acquired resistance. Various second-generation EGFR TKIs are currently being evaluated and may have the potential to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by virtue of their irreversible inhibition of the receptor TK domain.}

In this review, we evaluated whether molecular profiling of MPEs with next generation sequencing (NGS) could have a role in cancer management, focusing on lung cancer. We reviewed and compared the diagnostic performance of pleural fluid liquid biopsy with other types of samples. When applied in MPEs, NGS may have comparable performance with corresponding tissue biopsies, yield higher DNA amount, and detect more genetic aberrations than blood-derived liquid biopsies. NGS in MPEs may also be preferable to plasma liquid biopsy in advanced cancer patients with a MPE and a paucicellular or it could be difficult to obtain tissue/fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Of interest, post-centrifuge supernatant NGS may exhibit superior results compared to cell pellet, cell block or other materials. NGS in MPEs can also guide clinicians in tailoring established therapies and identifying therapy resistance. Evidence is still premature regarding the role of NGS in MPEs from patients with cancers other than lung. We concluded that MPE processing could provide useful prognostic and theranostic information, besides its diagnostic role.}

Methods Patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)�忛aive or TKI-treated but had not received chemotherapy were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and erlotinib 150 mg/d until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective was safety and tolerability. Results Twenty patients with TKI-treated and one with TKI-naive EGFR-mutant NSCLC were treated with nivolumab plus erlotinib. Treatment-related grade 3 toxicities occurred in five patients (liver enzyme elevations, n = 2; diarrhea, n = 2; weight loss, n = 1), with no grade ��4 toxicities. In the TKI-treated population, the objective response rate was 15\% (3 of 20, including one complete response), and the 24-week progression-free survival rate was 48\%. Responses lasted 13.8, 17.6, and 38.2 months per investigator records. A fourth patient had a nonconventional immune-related response lasting 12.5 months. Among these four patients, two were never-smokers and one each had 35�� and Conclusions Nivolumab plus erlotinib was tolerable, with durable responses in patients with EGFR-mutant, TKI-treated NSCLC.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy improves survival in previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. This study was conducted to determine the effect of bevacizumab (at 10 mg/kg) on survival duration for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred twenty-nine metastatic colorectal cancer patients previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) with bevacizumab; FOLFOX4 without bevacizumab; or bevacizumab alone. The primary end point was overall survival, with additional determinations of progression-free survival, response, and toxicity. RESULTS: The median duration of survival for the group treated with FOLFOX4 and bevacizumab was 12.9 months compared with 10.8 months for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (corresponding hazard ratio for death = 0.75; P = .0011), and 10.2 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone. The median progression-free survival for the group treated with FOLFOX4 in combination with bevacizumab was 7.3 months, compared with 4.7 months for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (corresponding hazard ratio for progression = 0.61; P {$<$} .0001), and 2.7 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone. The corresponding overall response rates were 22.7\%, 8.6\%, and 3.3\%, respectively (P {$<$} .0001 for FOLFOX4 with bevacizumab v FOLFOX4 comparison). Bevacizumab was associated with hypertension, bleeding, and vomiting.

  abstract = {Purpose Three agents with differing mechanisms of action are available for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer: fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. In this study, we compared the activity and toxicity of three different two-drug combinations in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had not been treated previously for advanced disease. Patients and Methods Patients were concurrently randomly assigned to receive irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin (IFL, control combination), oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FOLFOX), or irinotecan and oxaliplatin (IROX). The primary end point was time to progression, with secondary end points of response rate, survival time, and toxicity. Results A total of 795 patients were randomly assigned between May 1999 and April 2001. A median time to progression of 8.7 months, response rate of 45\%, and median survival time of 19.5 months were observed for FOLFOX. These results were significantly superior to those observed for IFL for all end points (6.9 months, 31\%, and 15.0 months, respectively) or for IROX (6.5 months, 35\%, and 17.4 months, respectively) for time to progression and response. The FOLFOX regimen had significantly lower rates of severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and dehydration. Sensory neuropathy and neutropenia were more common with the regimens containing oxaliplatin. Conclusion The FOLFOX regimen of oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin was active and comparatively safe. It should be considered as a standard therapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.},

It is also efficient as second-line therapy for patients who developed the T790M resistance mutation following treatment with previous generation TKIs. Here, we report 11 patients who were treated by an increasing dose of osimertinib from 80 mg to 160 mg QD orally following intracranial progression in either first- or second-line setting. Methods This is a subcohort analysis from a larger nonrandomized, phase 2, open-label trial, evaluating the efficacy of osimertinib dose escalation from 80 mg to 160 mg in EGFR-mutated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with intracranial progression in either first- (arm A) or second-line setting (arm B for T790M+ and C for T790M-). Results Eleven patients, 5 in arm A, 4 in arm B, and 2 in arm C were reported in this study. The mPFS of osimertinib before dose escalation was 11.4 簣 8.9 (6.6-30.7) months for arm A, 8.7 簣 1.8 (6.3-11.2) for arm B, and 14.5 簣 7.8 (6.7-22.3) for arm C. Intracranial response rate to dose escalation was 54\% (6 of 11) with 2 of 11 having intracranial stability. Median iPFS was 4.3 簣 7.4 (0.7-25.5) months; 3.8 簣 6.4 (1.8-18.9), 5.6 簣 9.7 (0.7-25.5), and 7.0 簣 2.7 (4.3-9.6) for arms A/B/C, respectively. Dose escalation was well tolerated with diarrhea and paronychia as the main dose-limiting symptoms. Conclusions Osimertinib 160 mg is feasible and may offer a therapeutic alternative for patients with isolated intracranial progression on osimertinib standard (80 mg) dose. Further studies on CNS osimertinib pharmacokinetics are needed to test this hypothesis.}

  abstract = {New generation sequencing (NGS) genetic testing is a powerful diagnostic tool and is increasingly used in the clinical workup of patients, especially in unusual presentations or where a positive family history suggests heritable disease. This review addresses the NGS technologies Targeted sequencing (TS), Whole exome sequencing (WES), Whole genome sequencing (WGS), and the use of gene panels or gene lists for clinical diagnostic purposes. These methods primarily assess nucleotide sequence but can also detect copy number variants and many tandem repeat expansions, greatly simplifying diagnostic algorithms for movement disorders. Studies evaluating the efficacy of NGS in diagnosing movement disorders have reported a diagnostic yield of up to 10.1\% for familial and 15.7\% for early-onset PD, 11.7–37.5\% for dystonia, 12.1–61.8\% for ataxia/spastic paraplegia and 11.3–28\% for combined movement disorders. Patient selection and stringency in the interpretation of the detected variants and genotypes affect diagnostic yield. Careful comparison of the patient's or family's disease features with the previously reported phenotype associated with the same variant or gene can avoid false-positive diagnoses, although some genes are implicated in various phenotypes. Moving from TS to WES and WGS increases the number of patients correctly diagnosed, but for many patients, a genetic cause cannot be identified today. However, new genetically defined entities are discovered at rapid pace, and genetic databases and our knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations expand steadily. We discuss the need for clear communication of genetic results and suggest a list of aspects to consider when reporting neurogenetic disorders using NGS testing.},

  abstract = {Purpose Bevacizumab provides a survival benefit in first- and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In a large, observational, bevacizumab treatment study (Bevacizumab Regimens: Investigation of Treatment Effects and Safety [BRiTE]) in patients who had mCRC, a longer-than-expected overall survival (OS) of 25.1 months was reported. The association between various pre- and post-treatment factors (including the use of bevacizumab beyond first progression [BBP]) and survival was examined. Patients and Methods The 1,445 of 1,953 previously untreated patients with mCRC who were enrolled in BRiTE and who experienced disease progression (PD) were classified into three groups: no post-PD treatment (n = 253), post-PD treatment without bevacizumab (no BBP; n = 531), and BBP (n = 642). Relevant baseline and on-study variables, including BBP, were analyzed with a Cox model with respect to their independent effect on survival beyond first PD. Results Median OS was 25.1 months (95\% CI, 23.4 to 27.5 months), and median progression-free survival was 10.0 months in the overall BRiTE population. Baseline and postbaseline factors were well balanced between the BBP and no-BBP groups. Median OS rates were 12.6, 19.9, and 31.8 months in the no post-PD treatment, no-BBP, and BBP groups, respectively. In multivariate analyses, compared with no BBP, BBP was strongly and independently associated with improved survival (HR, 0.48; P {$<$} .001). Hypertension that required medication was the only bevacizumab-related safety event that occurred more frequently in the BBP group (24.6\% v 19.2\%). Conclusion These results from a large, prospective, observational study suggest that continued vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition with bevacizumab beyond initial PD could play an important role improving the overall success of therapy for patients who have mCRC.},

However, the concomitant oncogenic drivers may affect the sensitivity of crizotinib. Herein, we present a 69-year-old never-smoker Chinese male with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring concomitant spectrin beta non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1)-ALK fusion, c-Met overexpression, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) amplification with inherent resistance to crizotinib, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Although the patient received timely and comprehensive treatment, the overall survival was only 8 months. Therefore, c-Met overexpression, HER-2 gene amplification, and SPTBN1-ALK gene fusion can coexist in lung adenocarcinoma and may become a potential biomarker of cancer refractory to crizotinib, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy as well as of a relatively poor prognosis. In addition, the novel SPTBN1-ALK fusion gene may become a potential target for anti-tumor therapy.}

  abstract = {The role of BRAF in tumor initiation has been established, however, the precise mechanism of autoinhibition has only been illustrated recently by several structural studies. These structures uncovered the basis by which the regulatory domains engage in regulating the activity of BRAF kinase domain, which lead to a more complete picture of the regulation cycle of RAF kinases. Small molecule BRAF inhibitors developed specifically to target BRAFV600E have proven effective at inhibiting the most dominant BRAF mutant in melanomas, but are less potent against other BRAF mutants in RAS-driven diseases due to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway. A variety of new generation inhibitors that do not show paradoxical activation have been developed. Alternatively, efforts have begun to develop inhibitors targeting the dimer interface of BRAF. A deeper understanding of BRAF regulation together with more diverse BRAF inhibitors will be beneficial for drug development in RAF or RASdriven cancers.},

  abstract = {cMet is a well-characterized oncogene that is the target of many drugs including small molecule and biologic pathway inhibitors, and, more recently, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). However, the clinical benefit from cMet-targeted therapy has been limited. We developed a novel cMet-targeted 'third-generation' ADC, TR1801-ADC, that was optimized at different levels including specificity, stability, toxin-linker, conjugation site, and in vivo efficacy. Our nonagonistic cMet antibody was site-specifically conjugated to the pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) toxin-linker tesirine and has picomolar activity in cancer cell lines derived from different solid tumors including lung, colorectal, and gastric cancers. The potency of our cMet ADC is independent of MET gene copy number, and its antitumor activity was high not only in high cMet-expressing cell lines but also in medium-to-low cMet cell lines (40 000-90 000 cMet/cell) in which a cMet ADC with tubulin inhibitor payload was considerably less potent. In vivo xenografts with low-medium cMet expression were also very responsive to TR1801-ADC at a single dose, while a cMet ADC using a tubulin inhibitor showed a substantially reduced efficacy. Furthermore, TR1801-ADC had excellent efficacy with significant antitumor activity in 90\% of tested patient-derived xenograft models of gastric, colorectal, and head and neck cancers: 7 of 10 gastric models, 4 of 10 colorectal cancer models, and 3 of 10 head and neck cancer models showed complete tumor regression after a single-dose administration. Altogether, TR1801-ADC is a new generation cMet ADC with best-in-class preclinical efficacy and good tolerability in rats.}

However, therapeutic efficacy is quite different in patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations versus common mutations. Patients with ex20ins mutations are insensitive to EGFR-TKIs and have poor prognosis. Some drugs targeting EGFR ex20ins mutations have been approved.

However, most patients develop acquired drug resistance to EGFR TKIs. HER3 is a unique pseudokinase member of the ERBB family that functions by dimerizing with other ERBB family members (EGFR and HER2) and is frequently overexpressed in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Although EGFR TKI resistance mechanisms do not lead to alterations in HER3, we hypothesized that targeting HER3 might improve efficacy of EGFR TKI. HER3-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of HER3-targeting antibody linked to a topoisomerase I inhibitor currently in clinical development. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of HER3-DXd across a series of EGFR inhibitor-resistant, patient-derived xenografts and observed it to be broadly effective in HER3-expressing cancers. We further developed a preclinical strategy to enhance the efficacy of HER3-DXd through osimertinib pre-treatment, which increased membrane expression of HER3 and led to enhanced internalization and efficacy of HER3-DXd. The combination of osimertinib and HER3-DXd may be an effective treatment approach and should be evaluated in future clinical trials in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Opioid-induced constipation is a frequent side-effect of opioid treatment, and standard interventions have limited or inconsistent efficacy. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of naldemedine, a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. METHODS: We report two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with chronic non-cancer pain and opioid-induced constipation. The first (COMPOSE-1) was done in 68 outpatient sites in seven countries and the second (COMPOSE-2) at 69 outpatient sites in six countries; both studies were done in Europe and the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years, did not use laxatives, and had a stable opioid regimen for treatment of chronic non-cancer pain with a total daily dose averaging at least 30 mg (morphine equivalent) for at least 1 month before screening. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral naldemedine 0·2 mg or matching placebo once a day for 12 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by average total daily opioid dose (30-100 mg and {$>$}100 mg equivalents of oral morphine sulphate). The primary endpoint was proportion of responders. A responder had at least three spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week with an increase from baseline of at least one SBM per week for at least 9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period including at least three of the last 4 weeks. Efficacy endpoints were analysed by intention to treat and the safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. These trials have both been completed and are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01965158 and NCT01993940. FINDINGS: In COMPOSE-1, 547 patients were recruited between Aug 29, 2013, and Jan 22, 2015, and were randomly assigned to receive naldemedine (n=274) or placebo (n=273). Patients for COMPOSE-2 were recruited between Nov 4, 2013, and June 9, 2015; 553 patients were randomly assigned to receive naldemedine (n=277) or placebo (n=276). Five patients were enrolled at more than one site, so were excluded from the intention-to-treat population (COMPOSE-1: one per group; COMPOSE-2: one in the naldemedine group, two from the placebo group), with intention-to-treat group sizes of 273 in the naldemedine group and 272 in the placebo group in COMPOSE-1, and 276 in the naldemedine group and 274 in the placebo group in COMPOSE-2. The proportion of responders in both trials was significantly higher with naldemedine than with placebo in COMPOSE-1 (130 responders [47·6\%] of 273 in the naldemedine group vs 94 responders [34·6\%] of 272 in the placebo group, difference 13·0\% [95\% CI 4·8-21·3]; p=0·002) and in COMPOSE-2 (145 [52·5\%] of 276 vs 92 [33·6\%] of 274, difference 18·9\% [10·8-27·0]; p{$<$}0·0001). Incidence of adverse events with naldemedine was similar to placebo (COMPOSE-1: 132 [49\%] of 271 in the naldemedine group vs 123 [45\%] of 272 in the placebo group; COMPOSE-2: 136 [50\%] of 271 vs 132 [48\%] of 274). Treatment-related adverse events were noted in 59 (22\%) of 271 patients in the naldemedine group and 45 (17\%) of 272 in the placebo group in COMOPOSE-1, and in 54 (20\%) of 271 patients in the naldemedine group and 31 (11\%) of 274 in the placebo group of COMPOSE-2; the between-group differences were largely due to gastrointestinal disorders, which were more common with naldemedine than placebo (COMPOSE-1: 40 [15\%] patients in the naldemedine group vs 18 [7\%] in the placebo group; COMPOSE-2: 42 [16\%] vs 20 [7\%]). INTERPRETATION: Naldemedine treatment led to a significantly higher responder rate than did placebo and was generally well tolerated. These results support that naldemedine could be a new option for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. FUNDING: Shionogi \& Co, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is involved in the initiation and progression of many different cancer types, including lymphomas, neuroblastoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. It is clear that ALK can be activated by translocation, as well as by mutation. The ALK locus is a hotspot for activating translocation events, with 22 different translocation partners identified. The resulting ALK fusion proteins are found in a wide range of cancer types. An alternative mechanism for ALK activation is through point mutation of the ALK locus, most commonly within the kinase domain, as reported in patients with neuroblastoma and thyroid cancer.The physiological function of ALK in mammals is enigmatic, although it is clear that ALK is not required for viability, as Alk−/− mice are viable. The role of ALK in model systems, such as Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio, is more clearly defined in development, with ALK signalling used repeatedly in a spatially and temporally regulated manner. In both D. melanogaster and C. elegans, ALK also has genetically defined ligands.The spatial and temporal expression pattern of the different oncogenic ALK fusion proteins is determined by the fusion partners. Furthermore, although not well studied, comparisons of the different ALK fusion proteins suggest that they display differences in signalling and in transforming and tumorigenic potential.The first clinically approved drug to target ALK — crizotinib — is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Recent reports suggest that ALK TKIs will be useful in the treatment of other less frequently occurring ALK-positive cancer types. A number of second-generation ALK TKIs are currently in clinical trials and are able to inhibit secondary 'resistance' mutations that are found in patients treated with crizotinib.Several important issues remain to be addressed, such as cooperativity between ALK and other oncogenes and tumour suppressors, the differences in signalling output between different ALK oncogenes, the streamlined identification of ALK-positive patients in multiple cancer types, putative combinatorial drug strategies for patients and an explanation for why the ALK locus is a hotspot for translocation.},

We compared efficacy of gefitinib with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) chemotherapy in this group of patients as first-line therapy. Patients and Methods In this randomized phase III trial, a total of 313 Korean never-smokers with stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, and adequate organ function were randomly assigned to receive either gefitinib (250 mg daily) or GP chemotherapy (gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8; cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks, for up to nine courses). The primary objective was to demonstrate better overall survival (OS) for gefitinib compared with GP in chemotherapy-naive NSLAs. Results Three hundred nine patients were analyzed per protocol (gefitinib arm, n = 159; GP arm, n = 150). Gefitinib did not show better OS compared with GP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.932; 95\% CI, 0.7...}

Advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies. On the molecular level, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; molecular features include activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, encoded by ERBB2), activation of hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and/or BRCA mutations. Treatment strategies differ according to molecular subtype. Management of breast cancer is multidisciplinary{$\mkern1mu$}; it includes locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches. Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-p ositive disease, chemotherapy{$\mkern1mu$}, anti-H ER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, bone stabilizing agents, poly(ADP-r ibose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers and, quite recently, immunotherapy. Future therapeutic concepts in breast cancer aim at individualization of therapy as well as at treatment de-escalation and escalation based on tumour biology and early therapy response. Next to further treatment innovations, equal worldwide access to therapeutic advances remains the global challenge in breast cancer care for the future.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive lung cancer accounts for a significant subgroup of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Approximately 4–10\% of EGFR mutations in NSCLC are EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are reportedly associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment. NSCLC patients carrying these mutations are rarely treated with EGFR-TKIs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib plus cetuximab combination therapy in experimental NSCLC models with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Materials and methods: The EGFR mutations examined in this study were A763\_Y764insFQEA, Y764\_V765insHH, A767\_V769dupASV, and D770\_N771insNPG. Ba/F3 cells constitutively expressing wild type or mutated EGFR were used to determine the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib plus cetuximab combination therapy in vitro. To determine the efficacy of the combination therapy in vivo, female BALB/c-nu mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 million Ba/F3 cells carrying EGFR A767\_V769dupASV or Y764\_V765insHH. Results: We observed a mild but significant (P {$<$} 0.05) additive effect of the combination therapy against several EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in vitro. Regarding EGFR A767\_V769dupASV and EGFR Y764\_V765insHH, cetuximab and afatinib single treatment did not induce significant inhibition of tumor formation; however, afatinib plus cetuximab combination treatment induced significant (P {$<$} 0.05) tumor growth inhibition without significant body weight loss or skin rash. Conclusion: The combination therapy induced a more potent inhibitory effect against several EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations than either therapy alone. Cetuximab can potentially increase the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib in NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.},

A systematic review was conducted to identify evidence on mutation frequency, prognostic impact, clinical, patient-reported, and economic outcomes associated with Exon 20ins. Materials and methods Searches were conducted in Embase and Medline and supplemented with recent conference proceedings. Included studies were not limited by intervention, geography, or publication year. Results Seventy-eight unique studies were included; 53 reporting mutation frequency, 13 prognostic impact, 36 clinical outcomes, and one humanistic burden. No economic burden data were identified. The frequency of Exon 20ins mutation ranged from 0.1\% to 4\% of all NSCLC cases and 1\% to 12\% of all EGFR mutations. Data on the prognostic impact of Exon 20ins were heterogeneous but highlighted poorer outcomes in patients with Exon 20ins mutation compared with patients with other EGFR mutations and EGFR wildtype across a wide range of therapies and treatment lines. Comparative evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of currently available therapies were limited, as were sample sizes of studies reporting on real-world effectiveness. Nine single-arm trials and 27 observational studies reported clinical outcomes for patients with Exon 20ins. Trends towards better survival and response were observed for chemotherapy compared with TKIs as first-line treatments. For subsequent treatment lines, novel targeted therapies provided encouraging preliminary responses while results for chemotherapy were less favorable. Limited safety data were reported. One conference abstract described the symptom burden for Exon 20ins patients with fatigue and pain being most common. Conclusion Findings of the systematic review show a high unmet need for safe and efficacious treatments for patients with Exon 20ins as well and need for further evidence generation to better understand the patient-level and economic impact for these patients.}

  abstract = {3514 Background: Second-line treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (Bev) or cetuximab (Cet) is now recognized as a standard treatment in mCRC. The main objective of this French multicenter, prospective open randomized trial was to evaluate the Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate at 4 months in patients receiving chemotherapy plus Bev or Cet after failure with Bev plus chemotherapy. Methods: The main eligibility criteria were disease progression after first-line chemotherapy: 5-FU with irinotecan or oxaliplatin associated with bevacizumab in wtKRAS mCRC. Patients were treated with cross over chemotherapy (FOLFIRI or mFOLFOX6) with bevacizumab (Arm A) or cetuximab (Arm B) until progression or limiting toxicity. The tumor response was evaluated every 6 weeks until progression using RECIST 1.1. Results: 133 patients, 86 male(64.7\%), PS 0 (n = 74, 57.8\%), 1 (n = 54, 42.2\%), in 25 sites in France, were included between October 2010 and May 2015. Most frequent chemotherapy regimens delivered were mFOLFOX6 + Bev (n = 41) or Cet (n = 42); FOLFIRI + Bev (n = 25) or Cet (n = 25). The PFS rate at 4 months was 79\% in Arm A and 66.7\% in Arm B (p = 0.09). Secondary objectives included median PFS: 7.1 months (Arm A) vs 5.6 months (Arm B) (HR = 1.43; 95\%CI [0.99-2.06] p = 0.06), and median OS: 15.9 months (Arm A) vs 10.6 months (Arm B) (HR = 1.44; 95\%CI [0.95-2.18] p = 0.08). Conclusions: In wtKRAS mCRC patients progressing after bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, continuation beyond progression with bevacizumab and crossover chemotherapy is associated with a numerically higher but not statistically significant median PFS and OS compared to cetuximab plus chemotherapy. Final data with KRAS and NRAS analysis will be presented at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT01442649.},

Some of the resistance mechanisms that present after osimertinib treatment, including a newly acquired EGFR C797S mutation, have been identified. It is unclear, however, whether the bypass pathway is also a mechanism of resistance in patients after osimertinib treatment. Methods Cells from malignant pleural effusion were collected and cultured at the time of progression in a patient being treated with osimertinib. Tumor genotyping was done by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization�懀ime of flight mass spectrometry. EGFR, AKT, MEK, and ERK phosphorylation were determined. An anchorage-dependent colony formation assay was used for drug sensitivity. Results An acquired mutation, BRAF V600E, was found in the patient at the time of progression while being treated with osimertinib. Cells grown from malignant pleural effusion were sensitive to BRAF V600E inhibitor and were more vulnerable to a combination treatment with osimertinib. Conclusions A potential mechanism of acquired resistance to osimertinib in patients with T790M is through the BRAF pathway. Simultaneous blockade of the BRAF and EGFR had a significant inhibitory effect.}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively randomized 605 patients to treatment with oral capecitabine for 14 days every 3 weeks or 5-FU/LV by rapid IV injection daily for 5 days in 4-week cycles.             RESULTS: The overall objective tumor response rate among all randomized patients was significantly higher in the capecitabine group (24.8\%) than in the 5-FU/LV group (15.5\%; P = .005). In the capecitabine and 5-FU/LV groups, median times to disease progression were 4.3 and 4.7 months (log-rank P = .72), median times to treatment failure were 4.1 and 3.1 months (P = .19), and median overall survival times were 12.5 and 13.3 months (P = .974), respectively. Capecitabine, compared with bolus 5-FU/LV treatment, produced a significantly lower incidence (P {$<$} .0002) of diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, and alopecia. Patients treated with capecitabine also displayed lower incidences of grade 3/4 stomatitis and grade 3/4 neutropenia (P {$<$} .0001) leading to significantly less neutropenic fever/sepsis. Grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (P {$<$} .00001) and grade 3/4 hyperbilirubinemia were the only toxicities more frequently associated with capecitabine than with 5-FU/LV treatment.             CONCLUSION: Oral capecitabine was more active than 5-FU/LV in the induction of objective tumor responses. Time to disease progression and survival were at least equivalent for capecitabine compared with the 5-FU/LV arm. Capecitabine also demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits over bolus 5-FU/LV in terms of tolerability.},

However, little is known about its real-world clinical impact as used in routine practice.We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients for whom plasma mNGS (Karius test) was performed for all indications at 5 United States institutions over 1.5 years. Comprehensive records review was performed, and standardized assessment of clinical impact of the mNGS based on the treating team’s interpretation of Karius results and patient management was established.A total of 82 Karius tests were evaluated from 39 (47.6\%) adults and 43 (52.4\%) children and a total of 53 (64.6\%) immunocompromised patients. Karius positivity rate was 50 of 82 (61.0\%), with 25 (50.0\%) showing 2 or more organisms (range, 2–8). The Karius test results led to positive impact in 6 (7.3\%), negative impact in 3 (3.7\%), and no impact in 71 (86.6\%), and was indeterminate in 2 (2.4\%). Cases with positive Karius result and clinical impact involved bacteria and/or fungi but not DNA viruses or parasites. In 10 patients who underwent 16 additional repeated tests, only 1 was associated with clinical impact.The real-world impact of the Karius test as currently used in routine clinical practice is limited. Further studies are needed to identify high-yield patient populations, define the complementary role of mNGS to conventional microbiological methods, and discern how best to integrate mNGS into current testing algorithms.}

  abstract = {Importance Ensartinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has shown systemic and central nervous system efficacy for patients withALK-positive non�𦽳mall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Objective To compare ensartinib with crizotinib among patients with advancedALK-positive NSCLC who had not received prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Design, Setting, and Participants This open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial conducted in 120 centers in 21 countries enrolled 290 patients between July 25, 2016, and November 12, 2018. Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older and had advanced, recurrent, or metastaticALK-positive NSCLC. Interventions Patients were randomized (1:1) to ensartinib, 225 mg once daily, or crizotinib, 250 mg twice daily. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was blinded independent review committee�弌ssessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included systemic and intracranial response, time to central nervous system progression, and overall survival. Efficacy was evaluated in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population as well as a prespecified modified ITT (mITT) population consisting of patients with central laboratory�𡤧onfirmedALK-positive NSCLC. Results A total of 290 patients (149 men [51.4\%]; median age, 54 years [range, 25-90 years]) were randomized. In the ITT population, the median PFS was significantly longer with ensartinib than with crizotinib (25.8 [range, 0.03-44.0 months] vs 12.7 months [range, 0.03-38.6 months]; hazard ratio, 0.51 [95\% CI, 0.35-0.72]; log-rankP Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial, ensartinib showed superior efficacy to crizotinib in both systemic and intracranial disease. Ensartinib represents a new first-line option for patients withALK-positive NSCLC. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02767804}

  abstract = {One strategy for combating cancer-drug resistance is to deploy rational polytherapy up front that suppresses the survival and emergence of resistant tumor cells. Here we demonstrate in models of lung adenocarcinoma harboring the oncogenic fusion of ALK and EML4 that the GTPase RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but not other known ALK effectors, is required for tumor-cell survival. EML4-ALK activated RAS-MAPK signaling by engaging all three major RAS isoforms through the HELP domain of EML4. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway via either a gain in the number of copies of the gene encoding wild-type K-RAS (KRAS(WT)) or decreased expression of the MAPK phosphatase DUSP6 promoted resistance to ALK inhibitors in vitro, and each was associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors in individuals with EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Upfront inhibition of both ALK and the kinase MEK enhanced both the magnitude and duration of the initial response in preclinical models of EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma. Our findings identify RAS-MAPK dependence as a hallmark of EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma and provide a rationale for the upfront inhibition of both ALK and MEK to forestall resistance and improve patient outcomes.}

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction Osimertinib is the current recommended treatment for EGFR T790M�𢖯ositive NSCLC after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. However, resistance to osimertinib therapy is inevitably acquired after a period of effective treatment. We had a patient with EGFR L858R/T790M�𢖯ositive NSCLC who initially responded to osimertinib therapy but eventually experienced development of resistance. Plasma cell�𡜻ree DNA analysis revealed the occurrence of exon 16�𦽳kipping HER2, which may have resulted in the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene (HER2) splice variant HER2D16. HER2D16 has never been reported in lung cancer, and HER2D16-driven signaling is known to be regulated by Src kinase in breast cancer. We investigated the role of HER2D16 as an osimertinib-resistant mechanism. Methods We constructed and established H1975 cells stably expressing HER2D16. The dimeric formation of HER2D16 was tested by using nonreducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The effects of the study drugs on signaling transduction were examined by using Western blot. Synergistic effect was assessed by using the Chou-Talalay method. Results We found that HER2D16 can form a homodimer in NSCLC cells. HER2D16-expressing H1975 cells were resistant to osimertinib treatment. We also found that mutant EGFR and HER2D16 cooperated to activate downstream signaling for osimertinib resistance. In addition, cotreatment with osimertinib and an Src kinase inhibitor failed to reverse resistance, indicating that HER2D16-driven signaling in NSCLC did not occur through a canonical pathway. Finally, we revealed that the combination of osimertinib with the pan-HER small-molecule inhibitor afatinib could synergistically repress cell growth and signaling in H1975-HER2D16 cells. Conclusion HER2D16 can contribute to osimertinib resistance through an Src-independent pathway. HER2D16 should be included in the molecular diagnosis panel for lung cancer.}

Patients and Methods: This meta-analysis included randomized trials comparing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies with chemotherapy. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS) for the trial population and prespecified subgroups were extracted. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment efficacy using the fixed-effects or random-effects model when appropriate. All statistical tests were two sided. Results: Seven trials involving 3871 patients were included. The pooled results showed that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy significantly prolonged OS (HR: 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.63 to 0.84) and PFS (HR: 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.99) compared to chemotherapy. OS benefit from immunotherapy were observed in all PD-L1 expression subgroups (negative: HR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.93; weak-positive: HR, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; strong-positive: HR, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.47 to 0.78). Strong-positive PD-L1 expression showed a trend towards more benefit compared to weak-positive PD-L1 expression (interaction P = 0.08). KRAS mutant (HR: 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.93), EGFR wild-type (HR: 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.61 to 0.87) and smoker (HR: 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.83) subgroups achieved significant OS benefit from immunotherapy compared to corresponding subgroups. Survival benefit to immunotherapy was not significantly associated with histology, CNS metastases, age, gender and performance status. Conclusion: This study confirmed that treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 improves overall survival compared with chemotherapy. Benefit was seen, regardless of PD-L1 expression levels; however, PD-L1 strong-positive patients trended to have greatest benefit. Patients with a KRAS mutant or EGFR wild-type tumor have improved survival benefit from immunotherapy compared with KRAS wild-type or EGFR mutant NSCLC, respectively.}

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction The reported prevalence of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene ( ALK ) rearrangement in NSCLC ranges from 2\% to 7\%. The primary standard diagnostic method is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Recently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) has also proved to be a reproducible and sensitive technique. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has also been advocated, and most recently, the advent of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) for ALK and other fusions has become possible. This study compares anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) evaluation with all four techniques in resected NSCLC from the large European Thoracic Oncology Platform Lungscape cohort. Methods A total of 96 cases from the European Thoracic Oncology Platform Lungscape iBiobank, with any ALK immunoreactivity were examined by FISH, central RT-PCR, and NGS. An H-score higher than 120 defines IHC positivity. RNA was extracted from the same formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. For RT-PCR, primers covered the most frequent ALK translocations. For NGS, the Oncomine Solid Tumour Fusion Transcript Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used. The concordance was assessed using the Cohen 庥 coefficient (two-sided 帢 �� 5\%). Results NGS provided results for 77 of the 95 cases tested (81.1\%), whereas RT-PCR provided results for 77 of 96 (80.2\%). Concordance occurred in 55 cases of the 60 cases tested with all four methods (43 ALK negative and 12 ALK positive). Using ALK copositivity for IHC and FISH as the criterion standard, we derived a sensitivity for RT-PCR/NGS of 70.0\%/85.0\%, with a specificity of 87.1\%/79.0\%. When either RT-PCR or NGS was combined with IHC, the sensitivity remained the same, whereas the specificity increased to 88.7\% and 83.9\% respectively. Conclusion NGS evaluation with the Oncomine Solid Tumour Fusion transcript kit and RT-PCR proved to have high sensitivity and specificity, advocating their use in routine practice. For maximal sensitivity and specificity, ALK status should be assessed by using two techniques and a third one in discordant cases. We therefore propose a customizable testing algorithm. These findings significantly influence existing testing paradigms and have clear clinical and economic impact.}

  abstract = {In the past 5 years, important advances have been made in the scientific understanding and clinical management of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The cellular immune landscape of CCA has been characterized and tumour subsets with distinct immune microenvironments have been defined using molecular approaches. Among these subsets, the identification of ‘immune-desert’ tumours that are relatively devoid of immune cells emphasizes the need to consider the tumour immune microenvironment in the development of immunotherapy approaches. Progress has also made in identifying the complex heterogeneity and diverse functions of cancer-associated fibroblasts in this desmoplastic cancer. Assays measuring circulating cell-free DNA and cell-free tumour DNA are emerging as clinical tools for detection and monitoring of the disease. Molecularly targeted therapy for CCA has now become a reality, with three drugs targeting oncogenic fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2)~fusions and one targeting neomorphic, gain-of-function variants of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)~obtaining regulatory approval. By contrast, immunotherapy using immune-checkpoint inhibitors has produced disappointing results in patients with CCA, underscoring the requirement for novel immune-based treatment strategies. Finally, liver transplantation for early~stage intrahepatic CCA under research protocols is emerging as a viable therapeutic option in selected patients. This Review highlights and provides in-depth information on these advances.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a new standard of care for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR tyrosine kinase or anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) genetic aberrations ( EGFR��/ALK�� ), but clinical benefit in patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements ( EGFR +/ ALK +) has not been shown. We assessed the effect of durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) treatment in three cohorts of patients with NSCLC defined by EGFR/ALK status and tumour expression of PD-L1. Methods ATLANTIC is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial at 139 study centres in Asia, Europe, and North America. Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC with disease progression following at least two previous systemic regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy (and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy if indicated); were aged 18 years or older; had a WHO performance status score of 0 or 1; and measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Key exclusion criteria included mixed small-cell lung cancer and NSCLC histology; previous exposure to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody; and any previous grade 3 or worse immune-related adverse event while receiving any immunotherapy agent. Patients in cohort 1 had EGFR+/ALK + NSCLC with at least 25\%, or less than 25\%, of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression. Patients in cohorts 2 and 3 had EGFR��/ALK �� NSCLC; cohort 2 included patients with at least 25\%, or less than 25\%, of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression, and cohort 3 included patients with at least 90\% of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression. Patients received durvalumab (10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, via intravenous infusion, for up to 12 months. Retreatment was allowed for patients who benefited but then progressed after completing 12 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with increased tumour expression of PD-L1 (defined as ��25\% of tumour cells in cohorts 1 and 2, and ��90\% of tumour cells in cohort 3) who achieved an objective response, assessed in patients who were evaluable for response per independent central review according to RECIST version 1.1. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of durvalumab and for whom any post-dose data were available. The trial is ongoing, but is no longer open to accrual, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02087423. Findings Between Feb 25, 2014, and Dec 28, 2015, 444 patients were enrolled and received durvalumab: 111 in cohort 1, 265 in cohort 2, and 68 in cohort 3.

To date, there is insufficient data to support the use of singleplex or next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to select first-line therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but considering the high number of level II alterations, according to the ESMO scale for clinical actionability of molecular targets (ESCAT), it is suggested to include patients in molecular screening programs in order to be able to offer targeted therapies for specific genomic alterations. This article aims at reviewing the most recent literature related to the most used methodologies/approaches for molecular diagnostics and variants’ classification, summarizing the internationally published molecular screening studies in support of MTB activity and, in the end, discussing MTBs’ current position and role in Italy, the number of which is increasing, also thanks to the thrust of institutions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene alterations are potent oncogenic drivers in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the ALK pathway are effective in treating ALK-positive NSCLC. Around 5\% of Asian and White patients with NSCLC have ALK-positive tumors, but ALK rearrangement prevalence data in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are limited. METHODS In this noninterventional epidemiology study, histologically confirmed nonsquamous NSCLC samples retained for {$<$} 5 years in tissue banks at six centers in MENA were retrospectively analyzed for ALK rearrangement using the VENTANA immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. Patient characteristics obtained were analyzed for association with ALK rearrangement. Concordance between IHC and Vysis fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ALK detection methods was assessed in a subset of samples. RESULTS Four hundred forty-eight tissue samples were analyzed using IHC: 137 (30.6\%) in Lebanon, 104 (23.2\%) in Saudi Arabia, 97 (21.7\%) in Egypt, 80 (17.9\%) in the United Arab Emirates, and 30 (6.7\%) in Morocco. On the basis of IHC, the prevalence was 8.7\% (95\% CI, 6.3 to 11.7) for ALK-positivity and 91.3\% (95\% CI, 88.3 to 93.7) for ALK-negativity. On the basis of FISH (n = 148), the prevalence was 5.4\% positivity and 81.8\% negativity (12.8\% nonevaluable). Concordance between IHC and FISH (n = 129) was 98.4\% (95\% CI, 94.2 to 99.8) for negative agreement and 98.5\% (95\% CI, 94.5 to 99.8) for overall agreement. Univariate analysis showed that ALK rearrangement was significantly associated with epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type status (P = .03) but was not significantly associated with sex, race, smoking history, or histologic subtype. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that ALK rearrangements are more prevalent in MENA than other geographic regions. High concordance was found between FISH and IHC. Except for epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type status, no clinicopathologic characteristics were associated with ALK-positive NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Background The EGFR T790M mutation is the most common mechanism of drug resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients who have lung cancer with an EGFR mutation (EGFR-mutated lung cancer). In preclinical models, the EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 has been shown to be effective against both EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitizing and T790M resistance mutations. Methods We administered AZD9291 at doses of 20 to 240 mg once daily in patients with advanced lung cancer who had radiologically documented disease progression after previous treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The study included dose-escalation cohorts and dose-expansion cohorts. In the expansion cohorts, prestudy tumor biopsies were required for central determination of EGFR T790M status. Patients were assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Results A total of 253 patients were treated. Among 31 patients enrolled in the dose-escalation cohorts, no dose-limiting toxic effects occurred at the doses evaluated. An additional 222 patients were treated in five expansion cohorts. The most common all-cause adverse events were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and decreased appetite. The overall objective tumor response rate was 51\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 45 to 58). Among 127 patients with centrally confirmed EGFR T790M who could be evaluated for response, the response rate was 61\% (95\% CI, 52 to 70). In contrast, among 61 patients without centrally detectable EGFR T790M who could be evaluated for response, the response rate was 21\% (95\% CI, 12 to 34). The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months (95\% CI, 8.3 to not reached) in EGFR T790M-positive patients and 2.8 months (95\% CI, 2.1 to 4.3) in EGFR T790M-negative patients. Conclusions AZD9291 was highly active in patients with lung cancer with the EGFR T790M mutation who had had disease progression during prior therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

  abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are approved treatments for non-small cell lung cancers harbouring activating mutations in the EGFR kinase, but resistance arises rapidly, most frequently owing to the secondary T790M mutation within the ATP site of the receptor. Recently developed mutant-selective irreversible inhibitors are highly active against the T790M mutant, but their efficacy can be compromised by acquired mutation of C797, the cysteine residue with which they form a key covalent bond. All current EGFR TKIs target the ATP-site of the kinase, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with alternative mechanisms of action. Here we describe the rational discovery of EAI045, an allosteric inhibitor that targets selected drug-resistant EGFR mutants but spares the wild-type receptor. The crystal structure shows that the compound binds an allosteric site created by the displacement of the regulatory C-helix in an inactive conformation of the kinase. The compound inhibits L858R/T790M-mutant EGFR with low-nanomolar potency in biochemical assays. However, as a single agent it is not effective in blocking EGFR-driven proliferation in cells owing to differential potency on the two subunits of the dimeric receptor, which interact in an asymmetric manner in the active state. We observe marked synergy of EAI045 with cetuximab, an antibody therapeutic that blocks EGFR dimerization, rendering the kinase uniformly susceptible to the allosteric agent. EAI045 in combination with cetuximab is effective in mouse models of lung cancer driven by EGFR(L858R/T790M) and by EGFR(L858R/T790M/C797S), a mutant that is resistant to all currently available EGFR TKIs. More generally, our findings illustrate the utility of purposefully targeting allosteric sites to obtain mutant-selective inhibitors.}

  abstract = {As immunotherapy has gained increasing interest as a new foundation for cancer therapy, some atypical response patterns, such as pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, have garnered the attention of physicians. Pseudoprogression is a phenomenon in which an initial increase in tumor size is observed or new lesions appear, followed by a decrease in tumor burden; this phenomenon can benefit patients receiving immunotherapy but often leads to premature discontinuation of treatment owing to the false judgment of progression. Accurately recognizing pseudoprogression is also a challenge for physicians. Because of the extensive attention on pseudoprogression, significant progress has been made. Some new criteria for immunotherapy, such as irRC, iRECIST and imRECIST, were proposed to accurately evaluate the response to immunotherapy. Many new detection indexes, such as ctDNA and IL-8, have also been used to identify pseudoprogression. In this review, the definition, evaluation criteria, mechanism, monitoring, management and prognosis of pseudoprogression are summarized, and diagnostic and treatment processes for patients with progression but with a suspicion of pseudoprogression are proposed; these processes could be helpful for physicians in clinical practice and enhances the understanding of pseudoprogression.},

There are no universally accepted, evidence-based guidelines on identifying patients with ALK -rearranged lung cancer using IHC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 465 resected specimens of non-small cell lung cancer using a tissue microarray as a test set. ALK protein expression using IHC with 5A4 monoclonal antibody (Novocastra) and ALK gene rearrangement using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with dual-color break-apart probes (Abbott molecular) were examined. Immunoreactivity was scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the results were compared with the FISH results. A diagnostic algorithm was derived from the correlation of the IHC and FISH results and applied to an additional 187 adenocarcinoma samples used as a validation set. Results: In the test set, ALK protein expression was detected in 40 patients (40/465, 8.6\%), consisting of IHC scores of 1 ( n = 14), 2 ( n = 10), and 3 ( n = 16), whereas 19 patients (19/453, 4.2\%) were FISH-positive. All the FISH-positive patients were assigned IHC scores of 2 or 3. All the patients with ALK IHC scores of 3 were FISH-positive, those with scores of 0 or 1 were FISH-negative, and those with scores of 2 were FISH variable. In the validation set, ALK protein expression was detected in 14 patients (scores of 1, n = 2; scores of 2, n = 6; and scores of 3, n = 6), of which nine patients (9/187, 4.8\%) were FISH-positive. All the patients with IHC scores of 0 or 1 were FISH-negative, and those with scores of 3 were FISH- positive. Among the patients with IHC scores of 2, three (3/6, 50\%) were FISH-positive. Conclusions: The sensitivity and specificity of IHC was 100\% and 95.8\%, respectively. These data supported an IHC scoring algorithm in which ALK IHC scores of 0, 1, or 3 were highly compatible with FISH results, and IHC scores of 2 were variable. Based on these findings, the IHC assay using the 5A4 antibody reliably detected non-small cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement and may be useful as a screening method to identify these tumors.}

Concomitant driver mutations [2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) G12, 1 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 19del, and 1 MET exon 14 skipping] were also observed in 4 adenocarcinomas. Echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions were identified in 95\% of ALK-rearranged patients, with 16.2\% of them also harboring additional non-EML4-ALK fusions. Nineteen non-EML4 translocation partners were also discovered, including 10 novel ones. Survival analyses revealed that patients concurrently harboring PIK3R2 alterations showed a trend toward shorter progression-free survival (6 vs. 13 months, P=0.064) and significantly shorter overall survival (11 vs. 32 months, P=0.004) than did PIK3R2-wild-type patients. Patients with concomitant alterations in PI3K the signaling pathway also had a shorter median overall survival than those without such alterations (23 vs. 32 months, P=0.014), whereas progression-free survival did not differ significantly. Conclusions The spectrum of ALK-fusion variants and the landscape of concomitant genomic alterations were delineated in 96 NSCLC patients. Our study also demonstrated the prognostic value of concomitant alterations in crizotinib-treated patients, which could facilitate improved stratification of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients in the selection of candidates who could optimally benefit from therapy.}

Resistant patient samples revealed a variety of point mutations in the kinase domain of ALK, including the L1196M gatekeeper mutation. In addition, some patients progress due to cancer metastasis in the brain. Using structure-based drug design, lipophilic efficiency, and physical-property-based optimization, highly potent macrocyclic ALK inhibitors were prepared with good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), low propensity for p-glycoprotein 1-mediated efflux, and good passive permeability. These structurally unusual macrocyclic inhibitors were potent against wild-type ALK and clinically reported ALK kinase domain mutations. Significant synthetic challenges were overcome, utilizing novel transformations to enable the use of these macrocycles in drug discovery paradigms. This work led to the discovery of 8k (PF-06463922), combining broad-spectrum potency, central nervous system ADME, and a high degree of kinase selectivity.}

  abstract = {Introduction The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion gene has been identified as a potent oncogenic driver in non�𦽳mall-cell lung cancer, in particular adenocarcinoma (ADC). It defines a unique subgroup of lung ADC, which may be responsive to ALK inhibitors. Detection of ALK rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered to be the standard procedure, but each with its own limitation. We evaluated the practical usefulness of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect ALK expression as a reliable detection method of ALK rearrangement in lung ADC. Methods We tested 373 lung ADCs for ALK rearrangement by IHC and FISH. Multiplex RT-PCR was performed to confirm the fusion variants. Results Twenty-two of 373 lung ACs (5.9\%) were positive for ALK immunoreactivity. ALK-positive tumor cells demonstrated strong and diffused granular staining in the cytoplasm. All the ALK IHC-positive cases were confirmed to harbor ALK rearrangement, either by FISH, or RT-PCR. Two cases with positive ALK protein expression, but negative for breakapart FISH signal were shown to harbor EML4-ALK variant 1 by RT-PCR. None of the ALK IHC-negative cases were FISH-positive. In addition, we identified a novel EML4-ALK fusion variant (E3:ins53A20), and its potent transformation potential has been confirmed by in vivo tumorigenicity assay. Conclusion IHC can effectively detect ALK rearrangement in lung cancer. It might provide a reliable and cost-effective diagnostic approach in routine pathologic laboratories for the identification of suitable candidates for ALK-targeted therapy.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This phase II trial investigated the safety and efficacy of two doses of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor, plus fluorouracil (FU)/leucovorin (LV) versus FU/LV alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred four previously untreated patients with measurable metastatic colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment groups: 36 to FU (500 mg/m(2))/LV (500 mg/m(2)) alone, 35 to FU/LV + low-dose bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks), and 33 to FU/LV + high-dose bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). FU/LV was given weekly for the first 6 weeks of each 8-week cycle. RESULTS: Compared with the FU/LV control arm, treatment with bevacizumab (at both dose levels) plus FU/LV resulted in higher response rates (control arm, 17\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 7\% to 34\%; low-dose arm, 40\%, 95\% CI, 24\% to 58\%; high-dose arm, 24\%, 95\% CI, 12\% to 43\%), longer median time to disease progression (control arm, 5.2 months, 95\% CI, 3.5 to 5.6 months; low-dose arm, 9.0 months, 95\% CI, 5.8 to 10.9 months; high-dose arm, 7.2 months, 95\% CI, 3.8 to 9.2 months), and longer median survival (control arm, 13.8 months; 95\% CI, 9.1 to 23.0 months; low-dose arm, 21.5 months, 95\% CI, 17.3 to undetermined; high-dose arm, 16.1 months; 95\% CI, 11.0 to 20.7 months). After cross-over, two of 22 patients had a partial response to bevacizumab alone. Thrombosis was the most significant adverse event and was fatal in one patient. Hypertension, proteinuria, and epistaxis were other potential safety concerns. CONCLUSION: The encouraging results of this randomized trial support further study of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg plus chemotherapy as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.},

We examined mRNA expression of BIM and MTOR in 57 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC from the EURTAC trial. Risk of mortality and disease progression was lower in patients with high BIM compared with low/intermediate BIM mRNA levels. Analysis of MTOR further divided patients with high BIM expression into two groups, with those having both high BIM and MTOR experiencing shorter overall and progression-free survival to erlotinib. Validation of our results was performed in an independent cohort of 19 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs. In EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with high BIM expression, concomitant high mTOR expression increased IC50 of gefitinib for cell proliferation. We next sought to analyse the signalling pattern in cell lines with strong activation of mTOR and its substrate P-S6. We showed that mTOR and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) strongly correlate in resistant EGFR-mutant cancer cell lines. These data suggest that the combination of EGFR TKI with mTOR or PDE4 inhibitors could be adequate therapy for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with high pretreatment levels of BIM and mTOR.}

However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate�弎inding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.}

  abstract = {Purpose: EML4-ALK is a transforming fusion tyrosine kinase, several isoforms of which have been identified in lung cancer. Immunohistochemical detection of EML4-ALK has proved difficult, however, likely as a result of low transcriptional activity conferred by the promoter-enhancer region of EML4 . The sensitivity of EML4-ALK detection by immunohistochemistry should be increased adequately. Experimental Design: We developed an intercalated antibody-enhanced polymer (iAEP) method that incorporates an intercalating antibody between the primary antibody to ALK and the dextran polymer-based detection reagents. Results: Our iAEP method discriminated between tumors positive or negative for EML4-ALK in a test set of specimens. Four tumors were also found to be positive for ALK in an archive of lung adenocarcinoma ( n = 130) and another 4 among fresh cases analyzed in a diagnostic laboratory. These 8 tumors were found to include 1 with EML4-ALK variant 1, 1 with variant 2, 3 with variant 3, and 2 with previously unidentified variants (designated variants 6 and 7). Inverse reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the remaining tumor harbored a novel fusion in which intron 24 of KIF5B was ligated to intron 19 of ALK . Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR analysis of additional archival tumor specimens identified another case of lung adenocarcinoma positive for KIF5B-ALK . Conclusions: The iAEP method should prove suitable for immunohistochemical screening of tumors positive for ALK or ALK fusion proteins among pathologic archives. Coupling of PCR-based detection to the iAEP method should further facilitate the rapid identification of novel ALK fusion genes such as KIF5B-ALK .}

  abstract = {The significance of B-RAF in the promotion of cell proliferation and motility was explored by the researchers in the past. However, in 2002, several researchers found that mutation in B-RAF leads to cancer. Extensive research on B-RAF mutations suggested B-RAF V600E mutation as a critical predictive, prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in numerous cancers such as melanoma, thyroid, and colorectal cancers. Based on the significance of B-RAF kinase and associated mutation, the present review will give a brief overview about structure and functions of B-RAF enzyme, its role in different types of cancer, available drugs in the market for B-RAF inhibition, chemical classification and SAR studies of reported investigational B-RAF inhibitors in patented and non-patented literature during last decade. The SAR provided for all the reported inhibitors will help researchers to gain knowledge about the possible structural features required for selective B-RAF inhibition. This insightful analysis of B-RAF will certainly help researchers to develop novel anticancer agents in the future.},

  abstract = {Background Osimertinib is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selective for sensitizing EGFR and EGFRT790M mutations and approved for the first-line treatment of patients with sensitizing EGFR-mutant NSCLC. EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations account for up to 4\% of all EGFR mutations and are generally resistant to EGFR TKIs. Although osimertinib is active against in vitro models of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation, its efficacy has not been prospectively studied. This phase II study has been performed to evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation who failed to standard chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03414814). Methods Patients received osimertinib 80mg orally once daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, withdrawal, or no clinical benefits. Primary end point was investigator-assessed, confirmed objective response rate (ORR) as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Secondary end points were safety profiles, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response. Results Between Jan 2018 and Feb 2019, 15 patients received osimertinib as second-line (20\%, n=3) and ≥ third-line (n=12) at stage 1 according to Simon’s minimax two-stage design (P0=0.10, P1=0.30; α=0.05, β=0.20). Median age was 61 years and female were 66.7\%. ORR was 0\% with mostly disease stabilization (stable disease, 46.7\%, n=7). Three patients who had EGFR exon 20 insertions at M766, A767, and unknown sites were still receiving osimertinib at the cut-off date (disease stabilization, 12, 7, and 7 months, respectively). Median PFS and OS were 3.5 months (95\% CI 1.6-not reached) and not reached (1-year OS rate, 56.3\%), respectively. Disease control rate at 6 months was 31.1\%. The most frequently observed adverse events (AEs, all grades, \%) were nausea (20\%, n=3), vomiting (20\%, n=3), anemia (13.3\%, n=2), and fever (13.3\%, n=2).

  abstract = {Apocrine carcinoma is a rare breast cancer subtype. As such, the genomic characteristics of apocrine carcinoma with triple negative immunohistochemical results (TNAC), which has been treated as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), have not been revealed. In this study, we evaluated the genomic characteristics of TNAC compared to TNBC with low Ki-67 (LK-TNBC). In the genetic analysis of 73 TNACs and 32 LK-TNBCs, the most frequently mutated driver gene in TNAC was TP53 (16/56, 28.6\%), followed by PIK3CA (9/56, 16.1\%), ZNF717 (8/56, 14.3\%), and PIK3R1 (6/56, 10.71\%). Mutational signature analysis showed enrichment of defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR)-related signatures (SBS6 and SBS21) and the SBS5 signature in TNAC, whereas an APOBEC activity-associated mutational signature (SBS13) was more prominent in LK-TNBC (Student’s t test, p\,{$<$}\,0.05). In intrinsic subtyping, 38.4\% of TNACs were classified as luminal A, 27.4\% as luminal B, 26.0\% as HER2-enriched (HER2-E), 2.7\% as basal, and 5.5\% as normal-like. The basal subtype was the most dominant subtype (43.8\%) in LK-TNBC (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), followed by luminal B (21.9\%), HER2-E (21.9\%), and luminal A (12.5\%). In the survival analysis, TNAC had a five-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate of 92.2\% compared to 59.1\% for LK-TNBC (P\,=\,0.001) and a five-year overall survival (OS) rate of 95.3\% compared to 74.6\% for LK-TNBC (P\,=\,0.0099). TNAC has different genetic characteristics and better survival outcomes than LK-TNBC. In particular, normal-like and luminal A subtypes in TNAC have much better DFS and OS than other intrinsic subtypes. Our findings are expected to impact medical practice for patients diagnosed with TNAC.},

  abstract = {Background Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is markedly sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. However, acquired resistance to crizotinib is inevitable through several mechanisms. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify genetic alterations associated with crizotinib resistance. Methods Tumor samples were derived from seven ALK-positive NSCLC patients who showed acquired resistance to crizotinib, and these patients were analyzed for ALK, EGFR, and KRAS mutations and ALK and EGFR gene amplifications. In vitro cytotoxicity of crizotinib and ALK downstream signals were compared between crizotinib-naive and -resistant NSCLC cells. Results After a median duration of 6 months (range, 4-12 months), seven ALK-positive NSCLC patients developed acquired resistance to crizotinib. Three patients harbored secondary ALK mutations, including one patient with both mutations: L1196M (n = 2) and G1269A (n = 2). Of note, one patient displayed ALK gene copy number gain (4.1-fold increase compared with the pre-crizotinib specimen) and EGFR L858R mutation with high polysomy. The amphiregulin concentration was high in the supernatant fluid from five patients with malignant pleural effusion (116.4-18934.0 pg/ml). SNU-2535 cells derived from a patient who harbored the G1269 mutation were resistant to crizotinib treatment similar to H3122 CR1 cells. L1196M and G1269A mutant clones were less sensitive to crizotinib and ALK downstream signals were ineffectively suppressed in these clones. Conclusions Genetic changes associated with crizotinib resistance are heterogeneous in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who respond to crizotinib and subsequently develop resistance.}

  abstract = {Summary Background ALK -rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK inhibitors) such as crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops, often with progression in the brain. Ceritinib is a more potent ALK inhibitor than crizotinib in vitro, crosses the blood�弎rain barrier in vivo, and shows clinical responses in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. We aimed to assess whole-body activity of ceritinib in both ALK inhibitor-pretreated and ALK inhibitor-naive patients with ALK -rearranged NSCLC. Methods ASCEND-1 was an open-label, phase 1 trial that recruited patients from 20 academic hospitals or cancer centres in 11 countries in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with ALK -rearranged locally advanced or metastatic cancer that had progressed despite standard therapy (or for which no effective standard therapy existed), who had at least one measurable lesion at baseline. The primary objective (to determine the maximum tolerated dose) has been reported previously. This updated analysis includes all patients with ALK -rearranged NSCLC given oral ceritinib at the recommended dose of 750 mg/day in the dose-escalation and expansion phases. Here we report the secondary outcomes of overall response, duration of response, and progression-free survival, analysed in all patients who received at least one 750 mg dose of ceritinib. Exploratory analyses included retrospective analysis of intracranial activity by independent neuroradiologists, in patients with untreated or locally treated neurologically stable brain metastases at baseline. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of ceritinib. This study is no longer recruiting patients; however, treatment and follow-up are ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01283516. Findings Between Jan 24, 2011, and July 31, 2013, 255 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of ceritinib 750 mg/day, of whom 246 had ALK -rearranged NSCLC. At data cutoff (April 14, 2014), median follow-up was 11繚1 months (IQR 6繚7��15繚2) and 147 (60\%) patients had discontinued treatment, 98 (40\%) as a result of disease progression. An overall response was reported in 60 (72\% [95\% CI 61��82]) of 83 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 92 (56\% [49��64]) of 163 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median duration of response was 17繚0 months (95\% CI 11繚3�忛on-estimable [NE]) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 8繚3 months (6繚8��9繚7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median progression-free survival was 18繚4 months (95\% CI 11繚1�幞E) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 6繚9 months (5繚6��8繚7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Of 94 patients with retrospectively confirmed brain metastases and at least one post-baseline MRI or CT tumour assessment, intracranial disease control was reported in 15 (79\% [95\% CI 54��94]) of 19 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and in 49 (65\% [54��76]) of 75 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Of these 94 patients, 11 had measurable brain lesions and no previous radiotherapy to the brain, six of whom achieved a partial intracranial response. Serious adverse events were recorded in 117 (48\%) of 246 patients. The most common grade 3��4 laboratory abnormalities were increased alanine aminotransferase (73 [30\%] patients) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (25 [10\%]). The most common grade 3��4 non-laboratory adverse events were diarrhoea and nausea, both of which occurred in 15 (6\%) patients. Two on-treatment deaths during the study were deemed to be related to study drug by the investigators, one due to interstitial lung disease and one as a result of multiorgan failure that occurred in the context of infection and ischaemic hepatitis. Interpretation The durable whole-body responses reported, together with the intracranial activity, support a clinical benefit for treatment with ceritinib in patients with ALK -rearranged NSCLC who have received crizotinib, or as an alternative to crizotinib. A confirmatory phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing to assess ceritinib activity in patients with ALK -rearranged NSCLC and brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

The third-generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib is active in EGFR-mutant/T790M positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Mechanisms of acquired resistance are emerging, and here we describe a cis-oriented solvent-front EGFR G796S mutation as the resistance mechanism observed in a progression biopsy and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from a patient with initial response followed by progression on osimertinib. This is one of the earliest reports of a sole solvent-front tertiary EGFR mutation as a resistance mechanism to osimertinib. Our case suggests a monoclonal resistance mechanism. We review the importance of the solvent-front residues across TKIs and describe known osimertinib resistance mechanisms. We observe that nearly all clinical osimertinib-resistant tertiary EGFR mutations are oriented in cis with EGFR T790M. This case highlights the importance of mutations affecting EGFR kinase domains and supports the feasibility of broad panel ctDNA assays for detection of novel acquired resistance and tumor heterogeneity in routine clinical care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although colon cancer (CC) with microsatellite instability (MSI) has a more favorable prognosis than microsatellite stable (MSS) CC, the impact varies according to clinicopathological parameters. We studied how MSI status affects prognosis in a trial-based cohort of stage II and III CC patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin or FOLFIRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue specimens of 1254 patients were tested for 10 different loci and were classified as MSI-high (MSI-H) when three or more loci were unstable and MSS otherwise. Study end points were overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: In stage II, RFS and OS were better for patients with MSI-H than with MSS CC [hazard ratio (HR) 0.26, 95\% CI 0.10-0.65, P = 0.004 and 0.16, 95\% CI 0.04-0.64, P = 0.01). In stage III, RFS was slightly better for patients with MSI-H CC (HR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.46-0.99, P = 0.04), but the difference was not statistically significant for OS (HR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.44-1.09, P = 0.11). Outcomes for patients with MSI-H CC were not different between the two treatment arms. RFS was better for patients with MSI-H than with MSS CC in the right and left colon, whereas for OS this was significant only in the right colon. For patients with KRAS- and BRAF-mutated CC, but not for double wild-type patients, RFS and OS were significantly better when the tumors were also MSI-H. An interaction test was statistically significant for KRAS and MSI status (P = 0.005), but not for BRAF status (P = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that for patients with stage II CC but less so for those with stage III MSI-H is strongly prognostic for RFS and OS. In the presence of 5-FU treatment, stage II patients with MSI-H tumors maintain their survival advantage in comparison with MSS patients and adding irinotecan has no added benefit.

  abstract = {As a receptor tyrosine kinase of insulin receptor (IR) subfamily, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been validated to play important roles in various cancers, especially anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and neuroblastomas. Currently, five small-molecule inhibitors of ALK, including Crizotinib, Ceritinib, Alectinib, Brigatinib, and Lorlatinib, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against ALK-positive NSCLCs. Novel type-I1/2 and type-II ALK inhibitors with improved kinase selectivity and enhanced capability to combat drug resistance have also been reported. Moreover, the “proteolysis targeting chimera” (PROTAC) technique has been successfully applied in developing ALK degraders, which opened a new avenue for targeted ALK therapies. This review provides an overview of the physiological and biological functions of ALK, the discovery and development of drugs targeting ALK by focusing on their chemotypes, activity, selectivity, and resistance as well as potential therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimum use of cytotoxic drugs for advanced colorectal cancer has not been defined. Our aim was to investigate whether combination treatment is better than sequential administration of the same drugs in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned 820 patients with advanced colorectal cancer to receive either first-line treatment with capecitabine, second-line irinotecan, and third-line capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (sequential treatment; n=410) or first-line treatment capecitabine plus irinotecan and second-line capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (combination treatment; n=410). The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with the number NCT00312000. FINDINGS: 17 patients (nine in the sequential treatment group, eight in the combination group) were found to be ineligible and were excluded from the analysis. 675 (84\%) patients died during the study: 336 in the sequential group and 339 in the combination group. Median overall survival was 16.3 (95\% CI 14.3-18.1) months for sequential treatment and 17.4 (15.2-19.2) months for combination treatment (p=0.3281). The hazard ratio for combination versus sequential treatment was 0.92 (95\% CI 0.79-1.08; p=0.3281). The frequency of grade 3-4 toxicity over all lines of treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups, except for grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, which occurred more often with sequential treatment than with combination treatment (13\%vs 7\%; p=0.004). INTERPRETATION: Combination treatment does not significantly improve overall survival compared with the sequential use of cytotoxic drugs in advanced colorectal cancer. Thus sequential treatment remains a valid option for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {Introduction Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene fusions respond well to ALK inhibitors but commonly develop on-target resistance mutations. The objective of this study is to collect clinical evidence for subsequent treatment with ALK inhibitors. Patients and Methods Local experience with on-target ALK resistance mutations and review of the literature identified 387 patients with ALK inhibitor resistance mutations. Clinical benefit of mutation-inhibitor combinations was assessed based on reported response, progression-free survival and duration of treatment. Furthermore, this clinical evidence was compared to previously reported in vitro sensitivity of mutations to the inhibitors. Results Of the pooled population of 387 patients in this analysis, 239 (62\%) received at least 1 additional line of ALK inhibition after developing on-target resistance to ALK inhibitor therapy. Clinical benefit was reported for 177 (68\%) patients, but differed for each mutation-inhibitor combination. Agreement between~in vitro~predicted sensitivity of 6 published models and observed clinical benefit ranged from 69\% to 89\%. The observed clinical evidence for highest probability of response in the context of specific on-target ALK inhibitor resistance mutations is presented. Conclusion Molecular diagnostics performed on tissue samples that are refractive to ALK inhibitor therapy can reveal new options for targeted therapy for NSCLC patients. Our comprehensive overview of clinical evidence of drug actionability of ALK on-target resistance mechanisms may serve as a practical guide to select the most optimal drug for individual patients.},

  abstract = {TPS3619 Background: Approximately 10\% of patients (pts) with mCRC have BRAF mutations (mostly V600E). 1L tx options for BRAFV600E mCRC are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy ± anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR, or immune checkpoint inhibitors in pts with MSI-H tumors. In Europe, Japan, and USA, the combination of BRAF inhibitor enco + EGFR inhibitor cetux is approved for tx of BRAFV600E mCRC after prior therapy. In BEACON CRC, enco + cetux resulted in a median overall survival (OS) of 9.3 months (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 8.0–11.3) and an objective response rate (ORR) of 19.5\% (95\% CI: 14.5\%–25.4\%) in previously treated pts with BRAFV600E mCRC (median follow-up: 12.8 months); 57.4\% of pts had grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs); 9\% discontinued due to AEs. Given the poor prognosis of pts with BRAFV600E mCRC and based on the efficacy and tolerability of enco + cetux from BEACON CRC, BREAKWATER will evaluate efficacy and safety of enco + cetux ± chemotherapy in tx-naive pts with BRAFV600E mCRC. Methods: BREAKWATER is an open-label, global, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 study with a safety lead-in (SLI). Approximately 60 and 870 pts will be enrolled in the SLI and phase 3 parts of the study, respectively. Pts must have BRAFV600E mCRC (determined using tumor tissue or blood); ECOG performance status 0/1; and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function.

  abstract = {PURPOSE To develop guideline recommendations concerning optimal neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer. METHODS ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of the literature on neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer and provide recommended care options. RESULTS A total of 41 articles met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the guideline recommendations. RECOMMENDATIONS Patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy should be managed by a multidisciplinary care team. Appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy include patients with inflammatory breast cancer and those in whom residual disease may prompt a change in therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy can also be used to reduce the extent of local therapy or reduce delays in initiating therapy. Although tumor histology, grade, stage, and estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression should routinely be used to guide clinical decisions, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of other markers or genomic profiles. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have clinically node-positive and/or at least T1c disease should be offered an anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen; those with cT1a or cT1bN0 TNBC should not routinely be offered neoadjuvant therapy. Carboplatin may be offered to patients with TNBC to increase pathologic complete response. There is currently insufficient evidence to support adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to standard chemotherapy. In patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR-positive), HER2-negative tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be used when a treatment decision can be made without surgical information. Among postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease, hormone therapy can be used to downstage disease. Patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative, HER2-positive disease should be offered neoadjuvant therapy in combination with anti-HER2-positive therapy. Patients with T1aN0 and T1bN0, HER2-positive disease should not be routinely offered neoadjuvant therapy. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.},

In preclinical testing, oral gefitinib inhibited the growth of NSCLC tumors that express the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a mediator of cell signaling, and phase 1 trials have demonstrated that a fraction of patients with NSCLC progressing after chemotherapy experience both a decrease in lung cancer symptoms and radiographic tumor shrinkages with gefitinib.ObjectiveTo assess differences in symptomatic and radiographic response among patients with NSCLC receiving 250-mg and 500-mg daily doses of gefitinib.Design, Setting, and PatientsDouble-blind, randomized phase 2 trial conducted from November 2000 to April 2001 in 30 US academic and community oncology centers. Patients (N = 221) had either stage IIIB or IV NSCLC for which they had received at least 2 chemotherapy regimens.InterventionDaily oral gefitinib, either 500 mg (administered as two 250-mg gefitinib tablets) or 250 mg (administered as one 250-mg gefitinib tablet and 1 matching placebo).Main Outcome MeasuresImprovement of NSCLC symptoms (2-point or greater increase in score on the summed lung cancer subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung [FACT-L] instrument) and tumor regression ({$>$}50\% decrease in lesion size on imaging studies).ResultsOf 221 patients enrolled, 216 received gefitinib as randomized. Symptoms of NSCLC improved in 43\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 33\%-53\%) of patients receiving 250 mg of gefitinib and in 35\% (95\% CI, 26\%-45\%) of patients receiving 500 mg. These benefits were observed within 3 weeks in 75\% of patients. Partial radiographic responses occurred in 12\% (95\% CI, 6\%-20\%) of individuals receiving 250 mg of gefitinib and in 9\% (95\% CI, 4\%-16\%) of those receiving 500 mg. Symptoms improved in 96\% of patients with partial radiographic responses. The overall survival at 1 year was 25\%. There were no significant differences between the 250-mg and 500-mg doses in rates of symptom improvement (P = .26), radiographic tumor regression (P = .51), and projected 1-year survival (P = .54). The 500-mg dose was associated more frequently with transient acne-like rash (P = .04) and diarrhea (P = .006).ConclusionsGefitinib, a well-tolerated oral EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, improved disease-related symptoms and induced radiographic tumor regressions in patients with NSCLC persisting after chemotherapy.}

  abstract = {Importance Targeting oncogenic drivers (genomic alterations critical to cancer development and maintenance) has transformed the care of patients with lung adenocarcinomas. The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium was formed to perform multiplexed assays testing adenocarcinomas of the lung for drivers in 10 genes to enable clinicians to select targeted treatments and enroll patients into clinical trials. Objectives To determine the frequency of oncogenic drivers in patients with lung adenocarcinomas and to use the data to select treatments targeting the identified driver(s) and measure survival. Design, Setting, and Participants From 2009 through 2012, 14 sites in the United States enrolled patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas and a performance status of 0 through 2 and tested their tumors for 10 drivers. Information was collected on patients, therapies, and survival. Interventions Tumors were tested for 10 oncogenic drivers, and results were used to select matched targeted therapies. Main Outcomes and Measures Determination of the frequency of oncogenic drivers, the proportion of patients treated with genotype-directed therapy, and survival. Results From 2009 through 2012, tumors from 1007 patients were tested for at least 1 gene and 733 for 10 genes (patients with full genotyping). An oncogenic driver was found in 466 of 733 patients (64\%). Among these 733 tumors, 182 tumors (25\%) had the KRAS driver; sensitizing EGFR , 122 (17\%); ALK rearrangements, 57 (8\%); other EGFR , 29 (4\%); 2 or more genes, 24 (3\%); ERBB2 (formerly HER2 ), 19 (3\%); BRAF , 16 (2\%); PIK3CA , 6 ( MET amplification, 5 ( NRAS , 5 ( MEK1 , 1 ( AKT1 , 0. Results were used to select a targeted therapy or trial in 275 of 1007 patients (28\%). The median survival was 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.96-7.70) for the 260 patients with an oncogenic driver and genotype-directed therapy compared with 2.4 years (IQR, 0.88-6.20) for the 318 patients with any oncogenic driver(s) who did not receive genotype-directed therapy (propensity score�弌djusted hazard ratio, 0.69 [95\% CI, 0.53-0.9], P = .006). Conclusions and Relevance Actionable drivers were detected in 64\% of lung adenocarcinomas. Multiplexed testing aided physicians in selecting therapies. Although individuals with drivers receiving a matched targeted agent lived longer, randomized trials are required to determine if targeting therapy based on oncogenic drivers improves survival.

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer had a low incidence several decades ago. However, it has become a predominant cancer and now accounts for approximately 10\% of cancer-related mortality in western countries. The ‘rise’ of colorectal cancer in developed countries can be attributed to the increasingly ageing population, unfavourable modern dietary habits and an increase in risk factors, such as smoking, low physical exercise and obesity. New treatments for primary and metastatic colorectal cancer have emerged, providing additional options for patients; these treatments include laparoscopic surgery for primary disease, more-aggressive resection of metastatic disease (such as liver and pulmonary metastases), radiotherapy for rectal cancer, and neoadjuvant and palliative chemotherapies. However, these new treatment options have had limited impact on cure rates and long-term survival. For these reasons, and the recognition that colorectal cancer is long preceded by a polypoid precursor, screening programmes have gained momentum. This Primer provides an overview of the current state of the art of knowledge on the epidemiology and mechanisms of colorectal cancer, as well as on diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract = {The management of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is becoming increasingly complex, with the identification of driver mutations/rearrangements and the development and availability of appropriate targeted therapies. In 2018, a group of medical oncologists with expertise in treating lung cancers used data from the published literature and experience to arrive at practical consensus recommendations for the treatment of advanced NSCLC for use by the community oncologists. These recommendations were subsequently published in 2019, with a plan to be updated annually. This article is an update to the 2019 consensus statement. For updating the consensus statement, a total of 25 clinically relevant questions on the management of patients with NSCLC on which consensus would be sought were drafted. The PubMed database was searched using the following terms combined with the Boolean operator �𦯷ND:�� (lung cancer, phase 3, non-small cell lung cancer AND non-small-cell lung cancer [MeSH Terms]) AND (clinical trial, phase 3 [MeSH Terms]) AND (clinical trial, phase iii [MeSH Terms]). In addition, �𦣇arcinoma, non-smallcell lung/drug therapy�� (MeSH Terms), �𦧺ung neoplasms/drug therapy�� (MeSH), clinical trial, phase III (MeSH Terms) were used to refine the search. The survey results and literature were reviewed by the core members to draft the consensus statements. The expert consensus was that molecular testing is a crucial step to be considered for patients with NSCLC at baseline, and in those who progress on first-line chemotherapy and have not undergone any prior testing. For mutations/rearrangement-negative patients who progress on first-line immunotherapy, doublet or single-agent chemotherapy with docetaxel and/or gemcitabine and/or ramucirumab should be considered. Patients who progress on the newer anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors should be considered for second-line therapy with lorlatinib or systemic chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy with pemetrexed is preferred for NSCLC with non-squamous histology and should be avoided in NSCLC with squamous histology.}

We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. Methods After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with non�𦽳mall-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy. Results Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57\% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33\%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77\%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72\%, with no median for the study reached. The drug resulted in grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects. Conclusions The inhibition of ALK in lung tumors with the ALK rearrangement resulted in tumor shrinkage or stable disease in most patients.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Real-world clinical outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion (exon20ins) mutations have not been extensively studied. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the clinical outcomes of EGFR exon20ins compared with common EGFR (cEGFR) mutations. METHODS Adults with advanced NSCLC harboring any EGFR mutations in the NSCLC Flatiron registry (2011 through May 2020) were included. To compare the relative prognosis (prognostic value) of exon20ins vs cEGFR, real-world overall survival (rwOS) was the primary endpoint. Separately, to compare the relative response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment (predictive value), real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) was the primary endpoint. RESULTS For the prognostic value analysis, 3014 patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC (cEGFR, n = 2833; EGFR exon20ins, n = 181) were eligible. The median (95\% CI) rwOS was 16.2 (11.04-19.38) months in the EGFR exon20ins cohort vs 25.5 (24.48-27.04) months in the cEGFR cohort (adjusted HR, 1.75 [1.45-2.13]; p {$<$} 0.0001); 5-year rwOS was 8\% and 19\%, respectively. For the predictive value analysis, 2825 patients received TKI treatment and were eligible (cEGFR, n = 2749; EGFR exon20ins, n = 76). The median (95\% CI) rwPFS from start of the first TKI was 2.9 (2.14-3.91) months in the EGFR exon20ins cohort vs 10.5 (10.05-10.94) months in the cEGFR cohort (adjusted HR, 2.69 [2.05-3.54]; p {$<$} 0001). Among patients with EGFR exon20ins, the most common prescribed first-line therapy was platinum-based chemotherapy (61.3\%) followed by EGFR TKIs (21.5\%); second-line treatments were varied, with no clear standard of care. CONCLUSIONS Patients with EGFR exon20ins have poor prognosis and receive little benefit from EGFR TKI treatment. More effective therapies are needed in this difficult-to-treat population.},

  abstract = {Synchronous colorectal carcinoma refers to more than one primary colorectal carcinoma detected in a single patient at initial presentation. A literature review has shown that the prevalence of the disease is approximately 3.5\% of all colorectal carcinomas. This disease has a male to female ratio of 1.8:1. The mean age at presentation of patients with synchronous colorectal cancer is in the early half of the seventh decade. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease), hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis and serrated polyps/hyperplastic polyposis are known to have a higher risk of synchronous colorectal carcinoma. These predisposing factors account for slightly more than 10\% of synchronous colorectal carcinomas. Synchronous colorectal carcinoma is more common in the right colon when compared to solitary colorectal cancer. On pathological examination, some synchronous colorectal carcinomas are mucinous adenocarcinomas. They are usually associated with adenomas and metachronous colorectal carcinomas. Most of the patients with synchronous colorectal cancer have two carcinomas but up to six have been reported in one patient. Patients with synchronous colorectal carcinoma have a higher proportion of microsatellite instability cancer than patients with a solitary colorectal carcinoma. Also, limited data have revealed that in many synchronous colorectal carcinomas, carcinomas in the same patient have different patterns of microsatellite instability status, p53 mutation and K-ras mutation. Overall, the prognosis of patients with synchronous colorectal carcinoma is not significantly different from that in patients with solitary colorectal carcinoma, although a marginally better prognosis has been reported in patients with synchronous colorectal carcinoma in some series. A different management approach and long-term clinical follow-up are recommended for some patients with synchronous colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Osimertinib was initially approved for T790M-positive non�𦽳mall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, more recently, for first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, resistance mechanisms to osimertinib have been incompletely described. Experimental Design: Using cohorts from The University of Texas MD Anderson Lung Cancer Moonshot GEMINI and Moffitt Cancer Center lung cancer databases, we collected clinical data for patients treated with osimertinib. Molecular profiling analysis was performed at the time of progression in a subset of the patients. Results: In the 118 patients treated with osimertinib, 42 had molecular profiling at progression. T790M was preserved in 21 (50\%) patients and lost in 21 (50\%). EGFR C797 and L792 (26\%) mutations were the most common resistance mechanism and were observed exclusively in T790M-preserved cases. MET amplification was the second most common alteration (14\%). Recurrent alterations were observed in 22 genes/pathways, including PIK3CA, FGFR, and RET. Preclinical studies confirmed MET, PIK3CA, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as potential resistance drivers. Alterations of cell-cycle genes were associated with shorter median progression-free survival (PFS, 4.4 vs. 8.8 months, P = 0.01). In 76 patients with progression, osimertinib was continued in 47 cases with a median second PFS (PFS2) of 12.6 months; 21 patients received local consolidation radiation with a median PFS of 15.5 months. Continuation of osimertinib beyond progression was associated with a longer overall survival compared with discontinuation (11.2 vs. 6.1 months, P = 0.02). Conclusions: Osimertinib resistance is associated with diverse, predominantly EGFR-independent genomic alterations. Continuation of osimertinib after progression, alone or in conjunction with radiotherapy, may provide prolonged clinical benefit in selected patients.

In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53\% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21\% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers' tissue of origin.},

  abstract = {9514 Background: Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 mutations is an unmet medical need. Poziotinib is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutants. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of poziotinib in previously treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in an independent cohort of a multi-cohort, multi-center Phase 2 study (ZENITH20-1). Methods: ZENITH20-1 study enrolled pts with advanced NSCLC with an EGFR exon 20 insertion identified on local tissue testing who had received at least one prior line of therapy. Poziotinib (16 mg) was administered orally QD, allowing dose reductions for AEs, with follow up for 24 months. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), evaluated centrally by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Efficacy was also evaluated by specific exon 20 insertions and prior lines of therapy. Results: 115 patients with a median age of 61 years (33-83) were enrolled. Patients had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-9.) The median relative dose intensity was 72\% (7-100\%) with 65\% having dose reductions. The ORR in the as-treated population was 14.8\% (95\% CI 8.9 - 22.6\%), and the DCR was 68.7\% (95\% CI 59.4 - 77.0\%) with a median DoR of 7.4 months. 65\% patients had tumor size reductions and the median PFS was 4.2 months. In the evaluable population (n = 88), the ORR was 19.3\% and the unconfirmed ORR was 25\%. Responses were predominantly observed in insertions between residues M766 to D770 of exon 20 (8/44; 18.2\%). Responses were observed in patients with 2 lines (14\%); ≥3 lines of therapy (16.2\%). The most common treatment-related Grade ≥3 AEs were rash (28\%), diarrhea (26\%), stomatitis (9\%) and paronychia (6\%). The incidence of treatment-related pneumonitis was 4\%, however some cases may have been confounded by prior checkpoint inhibitors as first line treatment. Conclusions: Although the ORR primary endpoint was not met, poziotinib induced tumor reduction in the majority of patients with durable responses, including the heavily pre-treated population. Responses were more common in patients with insertions between M766 to D770 of EGFR exon 20. The safety profile was overall consistent with other 2nd generation EGFR TKIs. Evaluation of these subgroups with refined dosing and improved toxicity management to maintain continuous treatment is warranted to assess the potential of poziotinib in Exon20 related tumors.

  abstract = {Purpose Histologic transformation of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) into small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been described as one of the major resistant mechanisms for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the molecular pathogenesis is still unclear. Methods We investigated 21 patients with advanced EGFR-mutant LADCs that were transformed into EGFR TKI-resistant SCLCs. Among them, whole genome sequencing was applied for nine tumors acquired at various time points from four patients to reconstruct their clonal evolutionary history and to detect genetic predictors for small-cell transformation. The findings were validated by immunohistochemistry in 210 lung cancer tissues. Results We identified that EGFR TKI-resistant LADCs and SCLCs share a common clonal origin and undergo branched evolutionary trajectories. The clonal divergence of SCLC ancestors from the LADC cells occurred before the first EGFR TKI treatments, and the complete inactivation of both RB1 and TP53 were observed from the early LADC stages in sequenced tumors. We extended the findings by immunohistochemistry in the early-stage LADC tissues of 75 patients treated with EGFR TKIs; inactivation of both Rb and p53 was strikingly more frequent in the small-cell-transformed group than in the nontransformed group (82\% v 3\%; odds ratio, 131; 95\% CI, 19.9 to 859). Among patients registered in a predefined cohort (n = 65), an EGFR mutant LADC that harbored completely inactivated Rb and p53 had a 43� greater risk of small-cell transformation (relative risk, 42.8; 95\% CI, 5.88 to 311). Branch-specific mutational signature analysis revealed that apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)-induced hypermutation was frequent in the branches toward small-cell transformation. Conclusion EGFR TKI-resistant SCLCs are branched out early from the LADC clones that harbor completely inactivated RB1 and TP53. The evaluation of RB1 and TP53 status in EGFR TKI-treated LADCs is informative in predicting small-cell transformation.}

Presented are results of nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab in the first-line therapy cohort from the phase II CheckMate 142 study. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with no prior treatment in the metastatic setting for MSI-H/dMMR CRC were treated with nivolumab every 2 weeks plus low-dose ipilimumab every 6 weeks until disease progression. The primary end point was objective response rate (investigator assessment; RECIST v1.1). RESULTS Median age of treated patients was 66 years (N 5 45). Median follow-up was 29.0 months. Objective response rate and disease control rate were 69\% (95\% CI, 53 to 82) and 84\% (95\% CI, 70.5 to 93.5), respectively, with 13\% complete response rate. Median duration of response was not reached; 74\% of responders had ongoing responses at data cutoff. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were not reached with minimum follow-up of 24.2 months (24-month rates, 74\% and 79\%, respectively). Clinical benefit was observed regardless of baseline demographic and tumor characteristics, including BRAF or KRAS mutation status. In a post hoc analysis, of 14 patients who discontinued treatment and did not receive subsequent therapy, 10 remained progression-free. Patient-reported outcomes were stable over the treatment period. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 22\% of patients; 13\% discontinued because of any-grade treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSION Nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab demonstrated robust and durable clinical benefit and was well tolerated as a first-line treatment for MSI-H/dMMR mCRC. Based on these promising data, randomized studies are warranted.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To determine the predictive and prognostic value of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal cancer (CRC) that represent a merging of gene expression–based features largely in primary tumors from six independent classification systems and provide a framework for capturing the intrinsic heterogeneity of CRC in patients enrolled in CALGB/SWOG 80405. PATIENTS AND METHODS CALGB/SWOG 80405 is a phase III trial that compared the addition of bevacizumab or cetuximab to infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin or fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan as first-line treatment of advanced CRC. We characterized the CMS classification using a novel NanoString gene expression panel on primary CRCs from 581 patients enrolled in this study to assess the prognostic and predictive value of CMSs in these patients. RESULTS The CMSs are highly prognostic for overall survival (OS; P {$<$} .001) and progression-free survival (PFS; P {$<$} .001). Furthermore, CMSs were predictive for both OS (P for interaction {$<$} .001) and PFS (P for interaction = .0032). In the CMS1 cohort, patients treated with bevacizumab had a significantly longer OS than those treated with cetuximab (P {$<$} .001). In the CMS2 cohort, patients treated with cetuximab had a significantly longer OS than patients treated with bevacizumab (P = .0046). CONCLUSION These findings highlight the possible clinical utility of CMSs and suggests that refinement of the CMS classification may provide a path toward identifying patients with metastatic CRC who are most likely to benefit from specific targeted therapy as part of the initial treatment.},

Despite the documented efficacy of osimertinib in first- and second-line settings, patients inevitably develop resistance, with no further clear-cut therapeutic options to date other than chemotherapy and locally ablative therapy for selected individuals. On account of the high degree of tumour heterogeneity and adaptive cellular signalling pathways in NSCLC, the acquired osimertinib resistance is highly heterogeneous, encompassing EGFR-dependent as well as EGFR-independent mechanisms. Furthermore, data from repeat plasma genotyping analyses have highlighted differences in the frequency and preponderance of resistance mechanisms when osimertinib is administered in a front-line versus second-line setting, underlying the discrepancies in selection pressure and clonal evolution. This review summarises the molecular mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including MET/HER2 amplification, activation of the RAS�𢘫itogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or RAS�𢖯hosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, novel fusion events and histological/phenotypic transformation, as well as discussing the current evidence regarding potential new approaches to counteract osimertinib resistance.}

For a long time, chemotherapy was the only systemic treatment for TNBC. Due to the lack of effective treatment options, the prognosis for TNBC is extremely poor. The successful application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) launched the era of immunotherapy in TNBC. However, the current findings show modest efficacy of programmed cell death- (ligand) 1 (PD-(L)1) inhibitors monotherapy and only a small proportion of patients can benefit from this approach. Based on the basic principles of immunotherapy and the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in TNBC, immune combination therapy is expected to further enhance the efficacy and expand the beneficiary population of patients. Given the diversity of drugs that can be combined, it is important to select effective biomarkers to identify the target population. Moreover, the side effects associated with the combination of multiple drugs should also be considered.},

TCR-T cell therapy is another active field of cellular immunotherapy for cancer. METHODS: We previously developed a human anti-CD19 antibody (ET190L1) and generated novel CD19-specific γ/δ TCR-T cells, ET019003, by fusing the Fab fragment of ET190L1 with γ/δ TCR constant chain plus adding an ET190L1-scFv/CD28 co-stimulatory molecule. ET019003 cells were tested in preclinical studies followed by a phase 1 clinical trial. RESULTS: ET019003 cells produced less cytokines but retained comparable antitumor potency than ET190L1-CAR-T cells in vivo and in vitro. In the first-in-human trial, eight patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were treated. CRS of grade 1 was observed in three (37.5\%) patients; ICANS of grade 3 was noted in one (12.5\%) patient. Elevation of serum cytokines after ET019003 infusion was almost modest. With a median follow-up of 34 (range 6-38) months, seven (87.5\%) patients attained clinical responses and six (75\%) achieved complete responses (CR). OS, PFS and DOR at 3~years were 75.0\%, 62.5\%, and 71.4\%, respectively. Notably, patient 1 with primary CNS lymphoma did not experience CRS or ICANS and got an ongoing CR for over 3~years after infusion, with detectable ET019003 cells in CSF. ET019003 showed striking in vivo expansion and persisted in 50\% of patients at 12~months. Three patients received a second infusion, one for consolidation therapy after CR and two for salvage therapy after disease progression, but no response was observed. ET019003 expansion was striking in the first infusion, but poor in the second infusion. CONCLUSIONS: CD19-specific γ/δ TCR-T cells, ET019003, had a good safety profile and could induce rapid responses and durable CR in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, even primary CNS lymphoma, presenting a novel and potent therapeutic option for these patients.

Acquisition of resistance to AZD9291 occurs inevitable and mechanisms need to be explored. We reported an advanced lung adenocarcinoma female with EGFR exon19 deletion treated on AZD9291 after failure of erlotinib and chemotherapy. Disease progressed again after 6 months�� treatment of AZD9291 with hepatic metastasis. Re-biopsy of the hepatic lesion showed histopathology transformation to small cell lung cancer, which harbored EGFR exon19 deletion. Therefore, small cell carcinoma transformation is one of potential resistance mechanisms to AZD9291 and regimen for small cell carcinoma may be one of the treatment options.}

  abstract = {Background: EGFR-activating mutations (L858R and ex19del) are major drivers (15-47\%) of lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR TKI development has changed the treatment paradigm for EGFR-mutant (EGFR+) NSCLC. However, tumors often develop acquired resistance mutations to current TKIs leading to clinical progression. EGFR+/T790M is the most prevalent acquired resistance mutation after first- and second-generation TKI treatment. Osimertinib, a third-generation TKI which targets EGFR+/T790M, can overcome this resistance, but faces further resistance within 10-18 months. EGFR+/C797S is the most significant on-target resistance mechanism to osimertinib, leading to EGFR+/T790M/C797S double resistant mutants. There are currently no approved targeted therapies for patients with EGFR+/T790M/C797S NSCLC. BLU-945 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the EGFR+/T790M/C797S and EGFR+/T790M mutations, with in vivo activity in subcutaneous and intracranial EGFR-mutant tumor models. Method: In vivo antitumor activity of BLU-945 was evaluated in engineered triple mutant cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models and osimertinib-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NSCLC. Plasma and tumor samples were collected for future pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. In vivo activity was also evaluated in an intracranial implantation model using luciferase-expressing YU-1097 patient-derived-cells harboring EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S resistance mutations, with the tumor burden of intracranial lesions measured by bioluminescence imaging. Results: Oral administration of BLU-945 to tumor-bearing mice showed potent EGFR pathway inhibition and significant single-agent antitumor activity at well-tolerated doses in the engineered osimertinib-resistant EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S CDX model, and an EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S PDX model. In addition, combination of BLU-945 with osimertinib showed enhanced antitumor activity compared with single-agent treatment in the EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S PDX model. Pharmacodynamic assays revealed treatment with BLU-945 resulted in marked inhibition of EGFR, AKT and ERK phosphorylation in the EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S CDX and EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S PDX models. BLU-945 also demonstrated potent activity in a patient-derived model of EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S implanted intracranially. Conclusion: BLU-945 is a potent, selective, and orally available fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor with robust antitumor activity in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC models grown subcutaneously and intracranially. BLU-945 shows activity as a single agent and in combination with other EGFR inhibitors. Clinical development of BLU-945 is expected in 2021.

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction The current standard initial therapy for advanced ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)�𢖯ositive NSCLC is a second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as alectinib. The optimal next-line therapy after failure of a second-generation ALK TKI remains to be established; however, standard options include the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib or platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. The efficacy of platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy has not been evaluated in cases that are refractory to second-generation TKIs. Methods This was a retrospective study performed at three institutions. Patients were eligible if they had advanced ALK-positive NSCLC refractory to one or more second-generation ALK TKI(s) and had received platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Results Among 58 patients eligible for this study, 37 had scans evaluable for response with measurable disease at baseline. The confirmed objective response rate to platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy was 29.7\% (11 of 37 patients; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 15.9\% �� 47.0\%), with median duration of response of 6.4 months (95\% CI: 1.6 months �� not reached). The median progression-free survival for the entire cohort was 4.3 months (95\% CI: 2.9 �� 5.8 months). Progression-free survival was longer in patients who received platinum/pemetrexed in combination with an ALK TKI compared to those who received platinum/pemetrexed alone (6.8 months vs. 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.33; p = 0.025). Conclusions Platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy shows modest efficacy in ALK-positive NSCLC after failure of second-generation ALK TKIs. The activity may be higher if administered with an ALK TKI, suggesting a potential role for continued ALK inhibition.}

  abstract = {Purpose Advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion-positive non–small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are effectively treated with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the molecular basis for this association is unknown. Patients and Methods We identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined. Results The most frequent ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43\%) and variant 3 in 51 patients (40\%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57\% v 30\%; P = .023). In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32\% v 0\%; P {$<$} .001). Analysis of the Foundation Medicine database revealed similar associations of variant 3 with ALK resistance mutation and with G1202R (P = .010 and .015, respectively). Among patients treated with the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib, variant 3 was associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival than variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95\% CI, 0.12 to 0.79; P = .011). Conclusion Specific ALK variants may be associated with the development of ALK resistance mutations, particularly G1202R, and provide a molecular link between variant and clinical outcome. ALK variant thus represents a potentially important factor in the selection of next-generation ALK inhibitors.},

Whether small cell transformation occurs in other oncogene-driven lung cancers remains unknown. Here we analyzed the genomic landscape of two pre-mortem and 11 post-mortem metastatic tumors collected from an advanced, ROS1 fusion-positive lung cancer patient, who had received sequential ROS1 inhibitors. Evidence of small cell transformation was observed in all metastatic sites at autopsy, with inactivation of RB1 and TP53, and loss of ROS1 fusion expression. Whole-exome sequencing revealed minimal mutational and copy number heterogeneity, suggestive of "hard" clonal sweep. Patient-derived models generated from autopsy retained features consistent with small cell lung cancer and demonstrated resistance to ROS1 inhibitors. This case supports small cell transformation as a recurring resistance mechanism, and underscores the importance of elucidating its biology to expand therapeutic opportunities.}

  abstract = {Drug resistance inevitably limits the efficacy of all targeted therapies including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Understanding the biological underpinnings of TKI resistance is key to the successful development of future therapeutic strategies. Traditionally, mechanisms of TKI resistance have been viewed under a dichotomous lens. Tumor cells are TKI-sensitive or TKI-refractory, exhibit intrinsic or acquired resistance, and accumulate alterations within or outside the target to promote their survival. Such classifications facilitate our comprehension of an otherwise complex biology, but are likely an oversimplification. Recent studies underscore the multifaceted, genetically heterogeneous nature of TKI resistance, which evolves dynamically with changes in therapy. In this Review, we provide a broad framework for understanding the diverse mechanisms of resistance at play in oncogene-driven lung cancers.}

But the way breast cancer is viewed has changed drastically since its molecular hallmarks were extensively characterised, now including immunohistochemical markers (eg, ER, PR, HER2 [ERBB2], and proliferation marker protein Ki-67 [MKI67]), genomic markers (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, and PIK3CA), and immunomarkers (eg, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1). New biomarker combinations are the basis for increasingly complex diagnostic algorithms. Neoadjuvant combination therapy, often including targeted agents, is a standard of care (especially in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer), and the basis for de-escalation of surgery in the breast and axilla and for risk-adapted post-neoadjuvant strategies. Radiotherapy remains an important cornerstone of breast cancer therapy, but de-escalation schemes have become the standard of care. ER-positive tumours are treated with 5-10 years of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, based on an individual risk assessment. For metastatic breast cancer, standard therapy options include targeted approaches such as CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, depending on tumour type and molecular profile.

In the GeparNuevo (NCT02685059) trial, addition of durvalumab to NACT as previously reported led to a moderate increase in pathological complete response (pCR) rate by an absolute 9\% (P~= 0.287). Patients and methods Patients with cT1b-cT4a-d triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) received durvalumab 1.5 g or placebo every 4 weeks added to nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks, followed by durvalumab/placebo every 4 weeks plus epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks followed by surgery. Durvalumab was not continued after surgery. The primary objective was pCR. Secondary endpoints included invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS). Results A total of 174 patients were randomised between June 2016 and October 2017. After a median follow-up of 43.7 months, 34 events had occurred. Despite a non-significant increase in the pCR rate, significant differences were observed for 3-year iDFS, DDFS and OS: iDFS was 85.6\% with durvalumab versus 77.2\% with placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.48, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.97, stratified log-rank P~= 0.036]; DDFS 91.7\% versus 78.4\% (HR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.13-0.74, P~= 0.005); OS 95.2\% versus 83.5\% (HR 0.24, 95\% CI 0.08-0.72, P~= 0.006). pCR patients had 3-year iDFS of 95.5\% with durvalumab and 86.1\% without (HR 0.22, 95\% CI 0.05-1.06). In the non-pCR cohort 3-year iDFS was 76.3\% versus 69.7\% (HR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.29-1.54). Multivariable analysis confirmed a durvalumab effect independent of the pCR effect. No new safety signals occurred. Conclusions Durvalumab added to NACT in TNBC significantly improved survival despite a modest pCR increase and no adjuvant component of durvalumab. Additional studies are needed to clarify the optimal duration and sequence of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of early TNBC.},

  abstract = {Crizotinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), shows marked activity in patients whose lung cancers harbor fusions in the gene encoding anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), but its efficacy is limited by variable primary responses and acquired resistance. In work arising from the clinical observation of a patient with ALK fusion-positive lung cancer who had an exceptional response to an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)-specific antibody, we define a therapeutic synergism between ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors. Similar to IGF-1R, ALK fusion proteins bind to the adaptor insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and IRS-1 knockdown enhances the antitumor effects of ALK inhibitors. In models of ALK TKI resistance, the IGF-1R pathway is activated, and combined ALK and IGF-1R inhibition improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with this finding, the levels of IGF-1R and IRS-1 are increased in biopsy samples from patients progressing on crizotinib monotherapy. Collectively these data support a role for the IGF-1R-IRS-1 pathway in both ALK TKI-sensitive and ALK TKI-resistant states and provide a biological rationale for further clinical development of dual ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have no response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, about 10 percent of patients have a rapid and often dramatic clinical response. The molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity to gefitinib are unknown. METHODS We searched for mutations in the EGFR gene in primary tumors from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who had a response to gefitinib, those who did not have a response, and those who had not been exposed to gefitinib. The functional consequences of identified mutations were evaluated after the mutant proteins were expressed in cultured cells. RESULTS Somatic mutations were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene in eight of nine patients with gefitinib-responsive lung cancer, as compared with none of the seven patients with no response (P{$<$}0.001). Mutations were either small, in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions clustered around the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain. Similar mutations were detected in tumors from 2 of 25 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer who had not been exposed to gefitinib (8 percent). All mutations were heterozygous, and identical mutations were observed in multiple patients, suggesting an additive specific gain of function. In vitro, EGFR mutants demonstrated enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in response to epidermal growth factor and increased sensitivity to inhibition by gefitinib. CONCLUSIONS A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor. Screening for such mutations in lung cancers may identify patients who will have a response to gefitinib.}

  abstract = {Introduction: The goal of personalized medicine is to treat patients with a therapy predicted to be efficacious based on the molecular characteristics of the tumor, thereby sparing the patient futile or toxic therapy. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors are effective against ALK-positive non�𦽳mall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors, but to date the only approved companion diagnostic is a break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a clinically applicable cost-effective test that is sensitive and specific for ALK protein expression. The purpose of this study was to assemble an international team of expert pathologists to evaluate a new automated standardized ALK IHC assay. Methods: Archival NSCLC tumor specimens ( n =103) previously tested for ALK rearrangement by FISH were provided by the international collaborators. These specimens were stained by IHC with the anti-ALK (D5F3) primary antibody combined with OptiView DAB IHC detection and OptiView amplification (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ). Specimens were scored binarily as positive if strong granular cytoplasmic brown staining was present in tumor cells. IHC results were compared with the FISH results and interevaluator comparisons made. Results: Overall for the 100 evaluable cases the ALK IHC assay was highly sensitive (90\%), specific (95\%), and accurate relative (93\%) to the ALK FISH results. Similar results were observed using a majority score. IHC negativity was scored by seven of seven and six of seven evaluators on three and two FISH-positive cases, respectively. IHC positivity was scored on two FISH-negative cases by seven of seven readers. There was agreement among seven of seven and six of seven readers on 88\% and 96\% of the cases before review, respectively, and after review there was agreement among seven of seven and six of seven on 95\% and 97\% of the cases, respectively. Conclusions: On the basis of expert evaluation the ALK IHC test is sensitive, specific, and accurate, and a majority score of multiple readers does not improve these results over an individual reader's score. Excellent inter-reader agreement was observed. These data support the algorithmic use of ALK IHC in the evaluation of NSCLC.}

  abstract = {Introduction Detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-gene rearrangements in non�𦽳mall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is mainly performed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). The question was raised if FISH might be replaced by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a reliable and reproducible manner across different laboratories. Methods After calibration of the staining instruments and training of the observers to binary interpretation (positive versus negative), 15 NSCLC were independently tested for ALK protein expression by IHC only in a multicenter setting (16 institutes). Each laboratory utilized the VENTANA ALK-D5F3 IHC assay. As demonstrated by FISH the samples displayed unequivocal ALK break-positivity (6�) and negativity (7�), as well as ALK positive-"borderline" character (2�), which is challenging for FISH diagnosis and thus was RT-PCR-confirmed. Results All seven ALK FISH-negative cases were homogenously scored as ALK-IHC negative. All 16 participants scored the two ALK positive-"borderline" samples as unequivocally positive according to their protein expression. Concordant IHC interpretation was also noticed in four of six unequivocal ALK break positive cases. In two of six some observers described a weak/heterogeneous ALK-IHC staining. This would have resulted in a subsequent ALK-testing (FISH/PCR) in a routine diagnostic setting. Conclusions This so-called "ALK-Harmonization-Study" shows for the first time that predictive semiquantitative IHC reveals reliable and reproducible results across several labs when methodology and interpretation are strictly defined and the pathologists are uniquely trained. The application of validated ALK IHC assays and its comparison to ALK-FISH is highly needed in future clinical trials. This might answer the question if ALK-IHC cannot only serve as a prescreening tool, but as a stand-alone test at least in cases displaying an unequivocally staining pattern as well as an alternative predictive test in samples with reduced FISH interpretability.}

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Guidelines for cancer genetic testing based on family history may miss clinically actionable genetic changes with established implications for cancer screening or prevention. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion and potential clinical implications of inherited variants detected using simultaneous sequencing of the tumor and normal tissue ("tumor-normal sequencing") compared with genetic test results based on current guidelines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From January 2014 until May 2016 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 10\,336 patients consented to tumor DNA sequencing. Since May 2015, 1040 of these patients with advanced cancer were referred by their oncologists for germline analysis of 76 cancer predisposition genes. Patients with clinically actionable inherited mutations whose genetic test results would not have been predicted by published decision rules were identified. Follow-up for potential clinical implications of mutation detection was through May 2017. EXPOSURE: Tumor and germline sequencing compared with the predicted yield of targeted germline sequencing based on clinical guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of clinically actionable germline mutations detected by universal tumor-normal sequencing that would not have been detected by guideline-directed testing. RESULTS: Of 1040 patients, the median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50.5-66 years), 65.3\% were male, and 81.3\% had stage IV disease at the time of genomic analysis, with prostate, renal, pancreatic, breast, and colon cancer as the most common diagnoses. Of the 1040 patients, 182 (17.5\%; 95\% CI, 15.3\%-19.9\%) had clinically actionable mutations conferring cancer susceptibility, including 149 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations; 101 patients tested (9.7\%; 95\% CI, 8.1\%-11.7\%) would not have had these mutations detected using clinical guidelines, including 65 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations. Frequency of inherited mutations was related to case mix, stage, and founder mutations. Germline findings led to discussion or initiation of change to targeted therapy in 38 patients tested (3.7\%) and predictive testing in the families of 13 individuals (1.3\%), including 6 for whom genetic evaluation would not have been initiated by guideline-based testing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this referral population with selected advanced cancers, universal sequencing of a broad panel of cancer-related genes in paired germline and tumor DNA samples was associated with increased detection of individuals with potentially clinically significant heritable mutations over the predicted yield of targeted germline testing based on current clinical guidelines. Knowledge of these additional mutations can help guide therapeutic and preventive interventions, but whether all of these interventions would improve outcomes for patients with cancer or their family members requires further study.

This drop is attributed, in part, to the tremendous therapeutic improvements, especially after the 2000s, in addition to increased social awareness regarding risk factors and diagnostic improvement. Five-fluorouracil, irinotecan, capecitabine, and later oxaliplatin were the mainstays of mCRC treatment from the 1960s to 2002. Since then, more than a dozen drugs have been approved for the disease, betting on a new chapter in medicine, precision oncology, which uses patient and tumor characteristics to guide the therapeutic choice.

A scientific literature search identified available data on molecular testing, treatments, and clinical monitoring of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. Consensus statements were dis­ cussed and developed by a European expert panel. This manuscript provides consensus management guidance for different clinical presentations of BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC and makes recommendations regarding treatment sequencing choices. To guide appropriate clinical management and treatment decisions for mCRC patients, tumour tissue analysis for DNA mismatch repair/microsatellite status and, at a minimum, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutational status is mandatory at the time of diagnosis. Finally, we discuss the rapidly evolving treatment landscape for BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC and define priorities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that are needed to improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis have translated into knowledge-based therapies directed against specific oncogenic signaling targets. These therapies often induce dramatic responses in susceptible tumors. Unfortunately, most advanced cancers, including those with robust initial responses, eventually acquire resistance to targeted therapies and relapse. Even though immune-based therapies are more likely to achieve complete cures, acquired resistance remains an obstacle to their success as well. Acquired resistance is the direct consequence of pre-existing intratumor heterogeneity and ongoing diversification during therapy, which enables some tumor cells to survive treatment and facilitates the development of new therapy-resistant phenotypes. In this review, we discuss the sources of intratumor heterogeneity and approaches to capture and account for it during clinical decision making. Finally, we outline potential strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes by directly targeting intratumor heterogeneity.}

We studied the efficacy of continuing or reintroducing bevacizumab in combination with second-line chemotherapy after progression to bevacizumab-based first-line therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase III study, patients with mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were randomized to receive in second-line mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI (depending on first-line regimen) with or without bevacizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival. To detect a hazard ratio (HR) for progression of 0.70 with an α and β error of 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, 262 patients were required. RESULTS: In consideration of the results of the ML18147 trial, the study was prematurely stopped. Between April 2008 and May 2012, a total of 185 patients were randomized. Bevacizumab-free interval was longer than 3 months in 43\% of patients in chemotherapy alone arm and in 50\% of patients in the bevacizumab arm. At a median follow-up of 45.3 months, the median progression-free survival was 5.0 months in the chemotherapy group and 6.8 months in the bevacizumab group [adjusted HR = 0.70; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-0.95; stratified log-rank P = 0.010]. Subgroup analyses showed a consistent benefit in all subgroups analyzed and in particular in patients who had continued or reintroduced bevacizumab. An improved overall survival was also observed in the bevacizumab arm (adjusted HR = 0.77; 95\% CI 0.56-1.06; stratified log-rank P = 0.043). Responses (RECIST 1.0) were similar in the chemotherapy and bevacizumab groups (17\% and 21\%; P = 0.573). Toxicity profile was consistent with previously reported data. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the continuation or the reintroduction of bevacizumab with second-line chemotherapy beyond first progression improves the outcome and supports the use of this strategy in the treatment of mCRC.

As tumor tissue rebiopsy at disease progression is not always feasible, noninvasive alternative methods are being explored. Liquid biopsy is emerging as a non-invasive, easy and repeatable tool to identify specific molecular alterations and monitor disease response during treatment. The dynamic follow-up provided by this analysis can provide useful predictive information and allow prompt therapeutic actions, tailored to the genetic profile of the recurring disease, several months before radiographic relapse. Oncogenic fusion genes are particularly suited for this type of analysis. Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is the dominant driver oncogene in several tumors, including Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma (ALCL), Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and others. Here we review recent findings in liquid biopsy technologies, including ctDNA, CTCs, exosomes, and other markers that can be investigated from plasma samples, in ALK-positive cancers.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the Medical Research Council (MRC) COIN trial, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted antibody cetuximab was added to standard chemotherapy in first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer with the aim of assessing effect on overall survival. METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, patients who were fit for but had not received previous chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (arm A), the same combination plus cetuximab (arm B), or intermittent chemotherapy (arm C). The choice of fluoropyrimidine therapy (capecitabine or infused fluouroracil plus leucovorin) was decided before randomisation. Randomisation was done centrally (via telephone) by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit using minimisation. Treatment allocation was not masked. The comparison of arms A and C is described in a companion paper. Here, we present the comparison of arm A and B, for which the primary outcome was overall survival in patients with KRAS wild-type tumours. Analysis was by intention to treat. Further analyses with respect to NRAS, BRAF, and EGFR status were done. The trial is registered, ISRCTN27286448. FINDINGS: 1630 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (815 to standard therapy and 815 to addition of cetuximab). Tumour samples from 1316 (81\%) patients were used for somatic molecular analyses; 565 (43\%) had KRAS mutations. In patients with KRAS wild-type tumours (arm A, n=367; arm B, n=362), overall survival did not differ between treatment groups (median survival 17·9 months [IQR 10·3-29·2] in the control group vs 17·0 months [9·4-30·1] in the cetuximab group; HR 1·04, 95\% CI 0·87-1·23, p=0·67). Similarly, there was no effect on progression-free survival (8·6 months [IQR 5·0-12·5] in the control group vs 8·6 months [5·1-13·8] in the cetuximab group; HR 0·96, 0·82-1·12, p=0·60). Overall response rate increased from 57\% (n=209) with chemotherapy alone to 64\% (n=232) with addition of cetuximab (p=0·049). Grade 3 and higher skin and gastrointestinal toxic effects were increased with cetuximab (14 vs 114 and 67 vs 97 patients in the control group vs the cetuximab group with KRAS wild-type tumours, respectively). Overall survival differs by somatic mutation status irrespective of treatment received: BRAF mutant, 8·8 months (IQR 4·5-27·4); KRAS mutant, 14·4 months (8·5-24·0); all wild-type, 20·1 months (11·5-31·7). INTERPRETATION: This trial has not confirmed a benefit of addition of cetuximab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Cetuximab increases response rate, with no evidence of benefit in progression-free or overall survival in KRAS wild-type patients or even in patients selected by additional mutational analysis of their tumours. The use of cetuximab in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine in first-line chemotherapy in patients with widespread metastases cannot be recommended.

Here, we report on the potential resistance mechanisms in a series of patients with ALK+ and ROS1+ NSCLC progressing on different types and/or lines of ROS1/ALK-targeted therapy.Experimental Design: We used a combination of next-generation sequencing (NGS), multiplex mutation assay, direct DNA sequencing, RT-PCR, and FISH to identify fusion variants/partners and copy-number gain (CNG), kinase domain mutations (KDM), and copy-number variations (CNVs) in other cancer-related genes. We performed testing on 12 ROS1+ and 43 ALK+ patients.Results: One of 12 ROS1+ (8\%) and 15 of 43 (35\%) ALK + patients harbored KDM. In the ROS1+ cohort, we identified KIT and 帣-catenin mutations and HER2-mediated bypass signaling as non-ROS1-dominant resistance mechanisms. In the ALK+ cohort, we identified a novel NRG1 gene fusion, a RET fusion, 2 EGFR, and 3 KRAS mutations, as well as mutations in IDH1, RIT1, NOTCH, and NF1 In addition, we identified CNV in multiple proto-oncogenes genes including PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, GNAS, K/HRAS, RET, NTRK1, MAP2K1, and others.Conclusions: We identified a putative TKI resistance mechanism in six of 12 (50\%) ROS1 + patients and 37 of 43 (86\%) ALK+ patients. Our data suggest that a focus on KDMs will miss most resistance mechanisms; broader gene testing strategies and functional validation is warranted to devise new therapeutic strategies for drug resistance.

  abstract = {Selective kinase inhibitors have had a substantial impact on the field of medical oncology. Whereas these agents can elicit dramatic clinical responses in some settings, their activity is generally limited to a subset of treated patients whose tumor cells harbor a specific genetic lesion. We have established an automated platform for examining the sensitivity to various molecularly targeted inhibitors across a large panel of human tumor-derived cell lines to identify additional genotype-correlated responses that may be clinically relevant. Among the inhibitors tested in a panel of 602 cell lines derived from a variety of human cancers, we found that a selective inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) potently suppressed growth of a small subset of tumor cells. This subset included lines derived from anaplastic large cell lymphomas, non-small-cell lung cancers, and neuroblastomas. ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that was first identified as part of a protein fusion derived from a chromosomal translocation detected in the majority of anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients, and has recently been implicated as an oncogene in a small fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and neuroblastomas. Significantly, sensitivity in these cell lines was well correlated with specific ALK genomic rearrangements, including chromosomal translocations and gene amplification. Moreover, in such cell lines, ALK kinase inhibition can lead to potent suppression of downstream survival signaling and an apoptotic response. These findings suggest that a subset of lung cancers, lymphomas, and neuroblastomas that harbor genomic ALK alterations may be clinically responsive to pharmacologic ALK inhibition.}

We stress the need for restricted estimation of variance in the chi-square function underlying interval estimation (and also point estimation and hypothesis testing). For RR analysis we propose a chi-square formulation analogous to that for RD and, thus, one which obviates the present practice of log transformation and its associated use of Taylor series approximation of the variance. As for OR analysis, we emphasize that the chi-square function, introduced by Cornfield for unstratified data, and extended by Gart to the case of stratified analysis, is based on the efficient score and thus embodies its optimality properties. We provide simulation results to evince the better performance of the proposed (parameter-constrained) procedures over the traditional ones.}

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$} e13510 {$<$}/jats:p{$><$}jats:p{$>$} Background: Broad molecular profile-based initiation of Tx in newly diagnosed NSCLC 4 (KF Mileham, Cancer Med, 2022) is advocated by NCCN guidelines. Despite this, Tx is often started prior to, and without knowledge of, an actionable oncogenic driver (AOD), and often without subsequent switch to appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In this study we sought to assess the impact of TAT of genomic testing on Tx in patients harboring a potentially actionable EGFR mutation. Methods: By interrogating the IC curated database, we identified 2,357 newly diagnosed NSCLC 4 patients (pts) who started an initial line of therapy (LOT 1) between 1/1/2019 and 12/31/2021. Squamous carcinoma pts were excluded unless documented to be never smokers or \&lt;age 40. We assessed testing across all sample types and performed the analysis on solid tumor tissue next-generation sequence (NGS) tested patients. We used an order for EGFR as a surrogate for AOD evaluation and collected date of order and reporting of EGFR test results, and date of 1{$<$}jats:sup{$>$}st{$<$}/jats:sup{$>$} Tx start. From this, we calculated TAT and whether Tx was initiated after genomic results. In addition, we captured whether testing was in-house or by reference lab (RL). We looked at the RLs that comprise of the top 85\% of NGS test sources, where the testing source was known. We removed records where test order dates and results dates were the same date, where test order dates or results dates were unknown, and where TAT \&gt; 90 days. EGFR Effective Testing Rate (EETR) is defined as EGFR result prior to line 1 Tx start. Results: Median age was 70 (range 40 - 89) and 50\% male. Pts with TAT of ≤7 days had an 82\% EETR vs. Pts with TAT of \&gt;29 days had a 61\% EETR. Overall, RLs had a median TAT of 19 days with a 72\% EETR, whereas in-house labs had a median TAT of 15 days with a EETR of 80\%. Conclusions: When providers and patients can obtain test results within 21 days of test order there is a higher likelihood of waiting for the test result to start Tx. Many community oncology practices are contemplating implementing in-house testing solutions to improve rates of testing and turnaround time of testing. This may prove to be an effective strategy given the better TAT for in-house testing. When there is faster TAT, patients and providers wait to start initial Tx. Getting patients on appropriate therapy based on their biomarker status can improve overall survival.[Table: see text] {$<$}/jats:p{$>$}},

  abstract = {FoundationOne®CDx (F1CDx) is a United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved companion diagnostic test to identify patients who may benefit from treatment in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling for 28 drug therapies. F1CDx utilizes next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) technology to examine 324 cancer genes in solid tumors. F1CDx reports known and likely pathogenic short variants (SVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), and select rearrangements, as well as complex biomarkers including tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), in addition to genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) in ovarian cancer. CGP services can reduce the complexity of biomarker testing, enabling precision medicine to improve treatment decision-making and outcomes for cancer patients, but only if test results are reliable, accurate, and validated clinically and analytically to the highest standard available. The analyses presented herein demonstrate the extensive analytical and clinical validation supporting the F1CDx initial and subsequent FDA approvals to ensure high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the data reported. The analytical validation included several in-depth evaluations of F1CDx assay performance including limit of detection (LoD), limit of blank (LoB), precision, and orthogonal concordance for SVs (including base substitutions [SUBs] and insertions/deletions [INDELs]), CNAs (including amplifications and homozygous deletions), genomic rearrangements, and select complex biomarkers. The assay validation of {$>$}30,000 test results comprises a considerable and increasing body of evidence that supports the clinical utility of F1CDx to match patients with solid tumors to targeted therapies or immunotherapies based on their tumor’s genomic alterations and biomarkers. F1CDx meets the clinical needs of providers and patients to receive guideline-based biomarker testing, helping them keep pace with a rapidly evolving field of medicine.},

  abstract = {Purpose Multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards (MTBs) interpret next-generation sequencing reports and help oncologists determine best therapeutic options; however, there is a paucity of data regarding their clinical utility. The purpose of this study was to determine if MTB-directed therapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) over immediately prior therapy in patients with advanced cancer. Methods This single-arm, prospective phase II clinical trial enrolled patients with advanced cancer with an actionable mutation who received MTB-recommended targeted therapy between January 1, 2017, and October 31, 2020. MTB-recommended both on-label (level 1 evidence) and off-label (evidence levels 2 and 3) therapies. Of the 93 enrolled patients, 43 were treated frontline and 50 received second-line or greater-line therapy. The primary outcome was the probability of patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy who achieved a PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 (PFS on MTB-directed therapy divided by PFS on the patient's immediately prior therapy). Secondary outcomes included PFS for patients treated frontline and overall survival and adverse effects for the entire study population. Results The most common disease sites were lung (35 of 93, 38\%), gynecologic (17 of 93, 18\%), GI (16 of 93, 17\%), and head and neck (7 of 93, 8\%). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 was 0.59 (95\% CI, 0.47 to 0.75) for patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy. The median PFS was 449 (range 42-1,125) days for patients treated frontline. The median overall survival was 768 (range 22-1,240) days. There were four nontreatment-related deaths. Conclusion When treated with MTB-directed therapy, most patients experienced improved PFS compared with immediately prior treatment. MTB-directed targeted therapy may be a strategy to improve outcomes for patients with advanced cancer.},

Microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (arrayCGH) or genotyping arrays have been standard technologies to detect large regions subject to copy number changes in genomes until most recently high-resolution sequence data can be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). During the last several years, NGS-based analysis has been widely applied to identify CNVs in both healthy and diseased individuals. Correspondingly, the strong demand for NGS-based CNV analyses has fuelled development of numerous computational methods and tools for CNV detection. In this article, we review the recent advances in computational methods pertaining to CNV detection using whole genome and whole exome sequencing data. Additionally, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses and suggest directions for future development.}

However, duration of responses is limited by the almost certain occurrence of drug resistance. Here, we report a case of a never smoker, 59-year-old female with metastatic ALK-positive adenocarcinoma, solid and signet ring patterns, who developed resistance to alectinib, a second-generation ALK-TKI, mediated by HER2 gene amplification. The patient received 22 months of crizotinib as first-line and subsequently 1-year of alectinib therapy. A study of resistance mechanism was performed with next generation sequencing (NGS) on tissue re-biopsy. A HER2-amplified emerging clone was identified by NGS in a liver metastasis and confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The resistant clone was detectable 2 months before disease progression in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) copy number variation (CNV) assay and it was retrospectively traced in rare cells of the lung primary by FISH. To our best knowledge, this is first evidence of HER2 gene amplification as a resistance mechanism to ALK-TKI in a NSCLC. Future strategies against oncogene-addicted NSCLC might benefit of combined drug treatments, such as ALK and HER2 inhibition.}

  abstract = {Purpose The exact definition of pathologic complete response (pCR) and its prognostic impact on survival in intrinsic breast cancer subtypes is uncertain. Methods Tumor response at surgery and its association with long-term outcome of 6,377 patients with primary breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane–based chemotherapy in seven randomized trials were analyzed. Results Disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly superior in patients with no invasive and no in situ residuals in breast or nodes (n = 955) compared with patients with residual ductal carcinoma in situ only (n = 309), no invasive residuals in breast but involved nodes (n = 186), only focal-invasive disease in the breast (n = 478), and gross invasive residual disease (n = 4,449; P {$<$} .001). Hazard ratios for DFS comparing patients with or without pCR were lowest when defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals (0.446) and increased monotonously when in situ residuals (0.523), no invasive breast residuals but involved nodes (0.623), and focal-invasive disease (0.727) were included in the definition. pCR was associated with improved DFS in luminal B/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) –negative (P = .005), HER2-positive/nonluminal (P {$<$} .001), and triple-negative (P {$<$} .001) tumors but not in luminal A (P = .39) or luminal B/HER2-positive (P = .45) breast cancer. pCR in HER2-positive (nonluminal) and triple-negative tumors was associated with excellent prognosis. Conclusion pCR defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals in breast and nodes can best discriminate between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Patients with noninvasive or focal-invasive residues or involved lymph nodes should not be considered as having achieved pCR. pCR is a suitable surrogate end point for patients with luminal B/HER2-negative, HER2-positive (nonluminal), and triple-negative disease but not for those with luminal B/HER2-positive or luminal A tumors.},

She achieved a partial response to treatment with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitor, crizotinib. After the tumor regrowth, crizotinib was switched to alectinib; once again a partial response was observed. At the second recurrence, transbronchial needle aspiration of the right paratracheal node was performed, which revealed cytological findings of small-cell carcinoma. While treatment with cisplatin-irinotecan chemotherapy made reduction of some tumor shadows, including the biopsied mediastinal lymph nodes, new, small, nodular shadows, highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases, were detected in both lung fields. This case may show proof of the transformation to small-cell lung cancer as a mechanism of resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors in anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearranged tumor. However, this transformation may also be only one part of the resistance mechanism of the heterogeneous tumor.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE               Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd, formerly DS-8201a) is a novel human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted antibody drug conjugate (ADC) with a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. A dose escalation and expansion phase I study evaluated the safety and activity of T-DXd in patients with advanced HER2-expressing/mutated solid tumors. Here, results for T-DXd at the recommended doses for expansion (RDE) in patients with HER2-low (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization−) breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02564900 ) are reported.                                         PATIENTS AND METHODS               Eligible patients had advanced/metastatic HER2-low–expressing breast cancer refractory to standard therapies. The RDE of 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg T-DXd were administered intravenously once every 3 weeks until withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, or progressive disease. Antitumor activity and safety were assessed.                                         RESULTS               Between August 2016 and August 2018, 54 patients were enrolled and received ≥ 1 dose of T-DXd at the RDE. Patients were extensively pretreated (median, 7.5 prior therapies). The confirmed objective response rate by independent central review was 20/54 (37.0\%; 95\% CI, 24.3\% to 51.3\%) with median duration of response of 10.4 months (95\% CI, 8.8 month to not evaluable). Most patients (53/54; 98.1\%) experienced ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; grade ≥ 3; 34/54; 63.0\%). Common (≥ 5\%) grade ≥ 3 TEAEs included decreases in neutrophil, platelet, and WBC counts; anemia; hypokalemia; AST increase; decreased appetite; and diarrhea. Three patients treated at 6.4 mg/kg suffered fatal events associated with T-DXd–induced interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis as determined by an independent adjudication committee.                                         CONCLUSION               The novel HER2-targeted ADC, T-DXd, demonstrated promising preliminary antitumor activity in patients with HER2-low breast cancer. Most toxicities were GI or hematologic in nature. ILD is an important identified risk and should be monitored closely and proactively managed.},

The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here. Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (�� 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225). Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type. The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7\%) were observed. Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4\%) and 117 (52.0\%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively. The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95\% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044). The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib. The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2\% and 46.3\% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively. Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis. Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI. Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.}

METHODS In this randomized, international, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned 419 patients with T790M-positive advanced non–small-cell lung cancer, who had disease progression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy, in a 2:1 ratio to receive either oral osimertinib (at a dose of 80 mg once daily) or intravenous pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter of body-surface area) plus either carboplatin (target area under the curve, 5 [AUC5]) or cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles; maintenance pemetrexed was allowed. In all the patients, disease had progressed during receipt of first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.

DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1612674 Copyright © 2016 Massachusetts Medical Society. RESULTS The median duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer with osimertinib than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months; hazard ratio; 0.30; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.41; P{$<$}0.001). The objective response rate was significantly better with osimertinib (71\%; 95\% CI, 65 to 76) than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (31\%; 95\% CI, 24 to 40) (odds ratio for objective response, 5.39; 95\% CI, 3.47 to 8.48; P{$<$}0.001). Among 144 patients with metastases to the central nervous system (CNS), the median duration of progression-free survival was longer among patients receiving osimertinib than among those receiving platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (8.5 months vs. 4.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.21 to 0.49). The proportion of patients with adverse events of grade 3 or higher was lower with osimertinib (23\%) than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (47\%). CONCLUSIONS Osimertinib had significantly greater efficacy than platinum therapy plus pemetrexed in patients with T790M-positive advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (including those with CNS metastases) in whom disease had progressed during first-line EGFR-TKI therapy.

CONCLUSIONS Gefitinib is superior to carboplatin�𢖯aclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia. The presence in the tumor of a mutation of the EGFR gene is a strong predictor of a better outcome with gefitinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00322452.)}

We engineered a bispecific EGFR-cMet antibody (JNJ-61186372) with multiple mechanisms of action to inhibit primary/secondary EGFR mutations and the cMet pathway. JNJ-61186372 blocked ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and cMet and inhibited phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT more potently than the combination of single receptor-binding antibodies. In NSCLC tumor models driven by EGFR and/or cMet, JNJ-61186372 treatment resulted in tumor regression through inhibition of signaling/receptor downmodulation and Fc-driven effector interactions. Complete and durable regression of human lung xenograft tumors was observed with the combination of JNJ-61186372 and a third-generation EGFR TKI. Interestingly, treatment of cynomolgus monkeys with JNJ-61186372 resulted in no major toxicities, including absence of skin rash observed with other EGFR-directed agents.

This rearrangement was shown to fuse the NPM nucleolar phosphoprotein gene on chromosome 5q35 to a previously unidentified protein tyrosine kinase gene, ALK, on chromosome 2p23. In the predicted hybrid protein, the amino terminus of nucleophosmin (NPM) is linked to the catalytic domain of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Expressed in the small intestine, testis, and brain but not in normal lymphoid cells, ALK shows greatest sequence similarity to the insulin receptor subfamily of kinases.

METHODS ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of relevant studies and develop recommendations for clinical practice. RESULTS Five systematic reviews and 10 randomized controlled trials met the systematic review inclusion criteria. RECOMMENDATIONS Doublet chemotherapy should be offered, or triplet therapy may be offered to patients with previously untreated, initially unresectable mCRC, on the basis of included studies of chemotherapy in combination with anti–vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. In the first-line setting, pembrolizumab is recommended for patients with mCRC and microsatellite instability-high or deficient mismatch repair tumors; chemotherapy and anti–epidermal growth factor receptor therapy is recommended for microsatellite stable or proficient mismatch repair left-sided treatment-naive RAS wild-type mCRC; chemotherapy and anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy is recommended for microsatellite stable or proficient mismatch repair RAS wild-type right-sided mCRC. Encorafenib plus cetuximab is recommended for patients with previously treated BRAF V600E–mutant mCRC that has progressed after at least one previous line of therapy. Cytoreductive surgery plus systemic chemotherapy may be recommended for selected patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases; however, the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not recommended. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be recommended following systemic therapy for patients with oligometastases of the liver who are not considered candidates for resection. Selective internal radiation therapy is not routinely recommended for patients with unilobar or bilobar metastases of the liver. Perioperative chemotherapy or surgery alone should be offered to patients with mCRC who are candidates for potentially curative resection of liver metastases. Multidisciplinary team management and shared decision making are recommended. Qualifying statements with further details related to implementation of guideline recommendations are also included.

The aim of our study was to identify the mechanisms underlying resistance to osimertinib and to correlate them with clinical outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced NSCLC who received osimertinib for T790M-mutated acquired resistance to prior EGFR-TKIs between March 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Patients with paired molecular data of pre-osimertinib and after resistance development, which were not confirmed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation, were included in the molecular analysis set. Of 49 patients evaluated in the molecular analysis set, 24 patients maintained T790M mutation, while 25 patients exhibited T790M-loss. Molecular modifications were identified in 27 of 49 patients including EGFR acquired mutations (C797S, C796S, G796S, V802I, V834L, E758D and G724S), non-EGFR-dependent mutations (PIK3CA, ALK, BRAF, KRAS and TP53), EGFR amplification and MET amplification. At data cutoff, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.3 months in the T790M-retain group compared with 7.8 months in T790M-loss patients (P = 0.053). Median PFS was significantly longer in patients with EGFR-dependent resistance mechanism (13.5 months) than in those with alternative pathway activation (8.2 months; P = 0.012). The study revealed heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib in advanced NSCLC patients and their association with clinical outcomes. Patients who maintained T790M mutation or with EGFR-dependent resistance mechanism had longer clinical outcome benefits.}

Each generation of ALK inhibitor showed improvements in terms of central nervous system (CNS) penetration and potency against wild-type (WT) ALK, yet a key continued limitation is their susceptibility to resistance from ALK active-site mutations. The solvent front mutation (G1202R) and gatekeeper mutation (L1196M) are major resistance mechanisms to the first two generations of inhibitors while patients treated with the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib often experience progressive disease with multiple mutations on the same allele (mutations in cis, compound mutations). TPX-0131 is a compact macrocyclic molecule designed to fit within the ATP-binding boundary to inhibit ALK fusion proteins. In cellular assays, TPX-0131 was more potent than all five approved ALK inhibitors against WT ALK and many types of ALK resistance mutations, e.g., G1202R, L1196M, and compound mutations. In biochemical assays, TPX-0131 potently inhibited (IC50 {$<$}10 nmol/L) WT ALK and 26 ALK mutants (single and compound mutations). TPX-0131, but not lorlatinib, caused complete tumor regression in ALK (G1202R) and ALK compound mutation-dependent xenograft models. Following repeat oral administration of TPX-0131 to rats, brain levels of TPX-0131 were approximately 66\% of those observed in plasma. Taken together, preclinical studies show that TPX-0131 is a CNS-penetrant, next-generation ALK inhibitor that has potency against WT ALK and a spectrum of acquired resistance mutations, especially the G1202R solvent front mutation and compound mutations, for which there are currently no effective therapies.}

Results from the IMpower150 trial led to the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the ABCP (atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel) regimen in 2018 as a treatment option for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC in the metastatic setting.3Socinski M.A. Jotte R.M.

In a separate analysis in 2019, the authors concluded that overall survival (OS) was also improved in the EGFR mutation-positive (EGFR mutation+) group with the ABCP regimen.5Reck M. Mok T.S.K.

The disappearance of a statistically significant OS benefit in these updated results should be a warning light for practitioners who have adopted routine use of ABCP in this patient population. CPIs have become a routine part of the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC, but the use of CPIs in EGFR mutation+ patients has been much less fruitful. Early studies evaluating CPIs in the second-line setting versus docetaxel revealed improvement in OS with the use of IO in the overall population, but this benefit did not translate to the subgroup of patients with EGFR mutations.9Rittmeyer A.

The positive OS results from the initial EGFR subgroup analysis in the IMpower150 study were therefore an exciting outcome that many were ready to implement into clinical practice. The main objective of the IMpower 150 trial was to evaluate whether the combination of ABCP could improve survival outcomes in metastatic, nonsquamous NSCLC. Patients were randomized to either treatment with ABCP, ACP (atezolizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel), or BCP. ABCP and ACP were each separately compared with BCP. The primary analysis population was patients with a wild-type genotype (excluded patients with EGFR or ALK genomic alterations). ABCP improved both OS and PFS in the wild-type and the ITT population indicating the combination could be used in advanced nonsquamous disease. The ACP regimen did not reveal statistically significant benefits.3Socinski M.A. Jotte R.M.

The three other subgroups evaluated were patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations, before EGFR TKI use, and baseline liver metastases. Results revealed an improvement in OS with ABCP in the EGFR-sensitizing mutation and liver metastases subgroups (HR = 0.31, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11��0.83 and HR = 0.52, 95\% CI: 0.33��0.82). PFS was also statistically improved in both of these subgroups and in patients previously on a TKI. These results marked the first time that a survival benefit was found with CPI use in EGFR positive (EGFR+) patients, and the authors rightfully called for further evaluation of this regimen in EGFR mutation+ disease.5Reck M. Mok T.S.K. Nishio M. et al.Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (IMpower150): key subgroup analyses of patients with EGFR mutations or baseline liver metastases in a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial.Lancet Respir Med. 2019; 7: 387-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar The final analysis of the subgroups included approximately 20 additional months of data collection. At that point, all the previously positive findings had lost statistical significance. In the EGFR-sensitizing mutation subgroup, the median OS for ABCP was 29.4 months compared with 18.1 months with BCP, but the CI now crossed one (95\% CI: 0.31��1.14). The liver metastases subgroup encountered the same issue on final analysis (95\% CI: 0.45��1.02). The ABCP arms for the two other subgroups (all EGFR mutations and previous TKI use) continued to reveal a statistically insignificant trend toward improved survival, and the ACP arms for all four subgroups continued to have similar survival results as the counterpart BCP arms.8Nogami N, Barlesi F, Socinski MA, et al. IMpower150 final exploratory analyses for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and chemotherapy in key NSCLC patient subgroups with EGFR mutations or metastases in the liver or brain. J Thorac Oncol. 2022;17:309-323.Google Scholar Does this mean that ABCP should not be used routinely for patients with advanced EGFR mutation+ disease? On the basis of the updated results, there would seem to be no compelling evidence that the ABCP combination should be a preferred regimen for EGFR mutation+ patients outside of a clinical trial. One could even argue that treating EGFR+ patients with ABCP on the basis of the initial analysis may have been premature given that this subgroup was small and was removed from the ITT analysis, and thus not included in the Food and Drug Administration label. Only 123 of 1202 patients in the study had an EGFR mutation, and even fewer patients had a sensitizing mutation (91) or were previously treated with a TKI (78). In addition, even though these were prespecified subgroups, the authors acknowledged that the results are exploratory and are not appropriately powered for formal statistical testing. This lack of power is why the IMpower150 subgroup data by itself should not be used to change clinical practice, although it is certainly compelling enough that the positive trends should still pique interest. The difference between the median OS of the ABCP and BCP arms in both of these subgroups is sizable and clinically significant (11 mo and 9 mo, respectively). The ACP arms, in contrast, had a similar OS compared with BCP. The difference between the ABCP and ACP results suggests that the addition of bevacizumab is potentially making difference. The investigators had hypothesized that bevacizumab would make the tumor environment more susceptible to IO. The major takeaway from the updated results is that we need larger studies evaluating the efficacy of programmed death-ligand 1 with chemotherapy (and possibly antiangiogenics) in EGFR mutation+ patients. The wait may not be too much longer as two trials focusing on patients with EGFR mutation+ nonsquamous NSCLC after progression on a TKI should have results presented soon. The global ORIENT-31 study is evaluating the quadruple regimen of sintilimab plus bevacizumab and platinum chemotherapy, with an estimated accrual of approximately 600 patients divided between three arms. Interestingly, patients will only have stage IIIB or IIIC disease that is not amenable resection or chemoradiation. It has already been announced in a news release that the study met its first primary end point of improved PFS at a first interim analysis.14Shibata T. Uryu S.

At the same time, it did provide a possible strategy out of this dilemma, and the upcoming phase 3 trials likely will put this issue to rest soon.

Thirty-one patients were included. Patients and methods Patients initially received a single oral dose of gefitinib followed by 10��14 days of observation. Oral gefitinib was subsequently administered on 14 consecutive days, every 28 days. Dose escalation was from 50 mg/day to a maximum of 925 mg/day or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Results Most adverse events were mild (grade 1/2); the most frequent were an acne-like rash and gastrointestinal effects. Two of six patients at 700 mg/day had DLT; no further dose escalation occurred. Cmax was reached within 3��7 h and exposure to gefitinib increased with dose. Mean terminal half-life following multiple dosing was 50.1 h (range 27.8��79.7 h). A partial response (duration 35��361 days) was observed in five of the23 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer over a range of doses (225��700 mg/day), and seven patients with a range of tumors had disease stabilization (duration 40��127 days). Conclusions In conclusion, gefitinib showed a favorable tolerability profile in Japanese patients. The safety profile, pharmacokinetic parameters and antitumor activity observed in our study are comparable to those observed in patients from the USA and Europe.}

We investigated if EGFR-activating mutation subtypes impact treatment outcomes in the phase III RELAY study. Associations between EGFR mutation type and preexisting co-occurring and treatment-emergent genetic alterations were also explored. Materials and Methods: Patients with metastatic NSCLC, an EGFR ex19del or ex21L858R mutation, and no central nervous system metastases were randomized (1:1) to erlotinib (150 mg/day) with either ramucirumab (10 mg/kg; RAM+ERL) or placebo (PBO+ERL), every 2 weeks, until RECIST v1.1�𡞫efined progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), PFS2, time-to-chemotherapy (TTCT), safety, and next-generation sequencing analyses. Results: Patients with ex19del and ex21L858R mutations had similar clinical characteristics and comutational profiles. One-year PFS rates for ex19del patients were 74\% for RAM+ERL versus 54\% for PBO+ERL; for ex21L858R rates were 70\% (RAM+ERL) versus 47\% (PBO+ERL). Similar treatment benefits (ORR, DOR, PFS2, and TTCT) were observed in RAM+ERL�懀reated patients with ex19del and ex21L858R. Baseline TP53 comutation was associated with superior outcomes for RAM+ERL in both ex19del and ex21L858R subgroups. EGFR T790M mutation rate at progression was similar between treatment arms and by mutation type. Conclusions: RAM+ERL provided significant clinical benefit for both EGFR ex19del and ex21L858R NSCLC, supporting this regimen as suitable for patients with either of these EGFR mutation types.}

However, acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs remains an inevitable problem. In this study, we aimed to discover novel therapeutic targets to conquer ALK-positive lung cancer. We established three types of ALK-TKI (crizotinib, alectinib and ceritinib)-resistant H2228 NSCLC cell lines by high exposure and stepwise methods. We found these cells showed a loss of ALK signaling, overexpressed AXL with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and had cancer stem cell-like (CSC) properties, suggesting drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations. Similarly, we demonstrated that TGF-帣1 treated H2228 cells also showed AXL overexpression with EMT features and ALK-TKI resistance. The AXL inhibitor, R428, or HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib, were effective in reversing ALK-TKI resistance and EMT changes in both ALK-TKI-resistant and TGF-帣1-exposed H2228 cells. Tumor volumes of xenograft mice implanted with established H2228-ceritinib-resistant (H2228-CER) cells were significantly reduced after treatment with ganetespib, or ganetespib in combination with ceritinib. Some ALK-positive NSCLC patients with AXL overexpression showed a poorer response to crizotinib therapy than patients with a low expression of AXL. ALK signaling-independent AXL overexpressed in drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations with EMT and CSC features may be commonly involved commonly involved in intrinsic and acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. This suggests AXL and HSP90 inhibitors may be promising therapeutic drugs to overcome drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations in ALK-positive NSCLC patients for the reason that ALK-positive NSCLC cells do not live through ALK-TKI therapy.}

  abstract = {Purpose A secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, is the most common resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutant adenocarcinomas that have progressed on erlotinib. Third-generation EGFR inhibitors capable of inhibiting mutant EGFR with T790M produce responses in nearly two thirds of patients. However, acquired resistance mechanisms in patients treated with these drugs are yet to be described. Experimental design To study acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors, T790M-positive cells derived from an erlotinib-resistant cancer were made resistant to a third-generation TKI and then characterized using cell and molecular analyses. Results Cells resistant to a third-generation TKI acquired an additional EGFR mutation, C797S, which prevented suppression of EGFR. Our results demonstrate that the allelic context in which C797S was acquired may predict responsiveness to alternative treatments. If the C797S and T790M mutations are in trans, cells will be resistant to third-generation EGFR TKIs, but will be sensitive to a combination of first- and third-generation TKIs. If the mutations are in cis, no EGFR TKIs alone or in combination can suppress activity. If C797S develops in cells wild-type for T790 (when third-generation TKIs are administered in the first-line setting), the cells are resistant to third-generation TKIs, but retain sensitivity to first-generation TKIs. Conclusions Mutation of C797S in EGFR is a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to third-generation TKIs. The context in which the C797S develops with respect to the other EGFR alleles affects the efficacy of subsequent treatments.}

However, relapse typically occurs after an average of 1 year of continuous treatment. A fundamental histological transformation from NSCLC to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is observed in a subset of the resistant cancers, but the molecular changes associated with this transformation remain unknown. Analysis of tumour samples and cell lines derived from resistant EGFR mutant patients revealed that Retinoblastoma (RB) is lost in 100\% of these SCLC transformed cases, but rarely in those that remain NSCLC. Further, increased neuroendocrine marker and decreased EGFR expression as well as greater sensitivity to BCL2 family inhibition are observed in resistant SCLC transformed cancers compared with resistant NSCLCs. Together, these findings suggest that this subset of resistant cancers ultimately adopt many of the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of classical SCLC.}

Therefore, a next-generation treatment strategy is warranted in the osimertinib era. We investigated the mechanism of resistance to a novel EGFR-TKI, naquotinib, with the goal of developing a novel treatment strategy. We established multiple naquotinib-resistant cell lines or osimertinib-resistant cells, two of which were derived from EGFR-TKI-naive cells; the others were derived from gefitinib- or afatinib-resistant cells harboring EGFR T790M. We comprehensively analyzed the RNA kinome sequence, but no universal gene alterations were detected in naquotinib-resistant cells. Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) amplification was detected in naquotinib-resistant cells derived from gefitinib-resistant cells. The combination therapy of MEK inhibitors and naquotinib exhibited a highly beneficial effect in resistant cells with NRAS amplification, but the combination of MEK inhibitors and osimertinib had limited effects on naquotinib-resistant cells. Moreover, the combination of MEK inhibitors and naquotinib inhibited the growth of osimertinib-resistant cells, while the combination of MEK inhibitors and osimertinib had little effect on osimertinib-resistant cells. Clinical assessment of this novel combination (MEK inhibitors and naquotinib) is worth considering in osimertinib-resistant lung tumors.}

Conclusions This final exploratory analysis showed OS benefits for ABCP versus BCP in patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations, including those with prior TKI failures, and with liver metastases, although these results should be interpreted with caution. The impact of ABCP on delaying the development of new brain lesions requires further investigation.}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: ALUR (MO29750; NCT02604342) was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase III trial of alectinib versus chemotherapy in advanced/metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC patients previously treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and crizotinib. Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive alectinib 600\,mg twice daily or chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500\,mg/m2 or docetaxel 75\,mg/m2, both every 3\,weeks) until disease progression, death, or withdrawal. Primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Altogether, 107 patients were randomized (alectinib, n\,=\,72; chemotherapy, n\,=\,35) in 13 countries across Europe and Asia. Median investigator-assessed PFS was 9.6\,months [95\% confidence interval (CI): 6.9-12.2] with alectinib and 1.4\,months (95\% CI: 1.3-1.6) with chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.15 (95\% CI: 0.08-0.29); P\,{$<$}\,0.001]. Independent Review Committee-assessed PFS was also significantly longer with alectinib [HR 0.32 (95\% CI: 0.17-0.59); median PFS was 7.1\,months (95\% CI: 6.3-10.8) with alectinib and 1.6\,months (95\% CI: 1.3-4.1) with chemotherapy]. In patients with measurable baseline central nervous system (CNS) disease (alectinib, n\,=\,24; chemotherapy, n\,=\,16), CNS objective response rate was significantly higher with alectinib (54.2\%) versus chemotherapy (0\%; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Grade ≥3 adverse events were more common with chemotherapy (41.2\%) than alectinib (27.1\%). Incidence of AEs leading to study-drug discontinuation was lower with alectinib (5.7\%) than chemotherapy (8.8\%), despite alectinib treatment duration being longer (20.1\,weeks versus 6.0\,weeks). CONCLUSION: Alectinib significantly improved systemic and CNS efficacy versus chemotherapy for crizotinib-pretreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients, with a favorable safety profile.

Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are mutation-selective inhibitors with minimal effects on wild-type EGFR. Acquired resistance develops to these agents, however, the mechanisms are as yet uncharacterized. In this study, we report that the Src-AKT pathway contributes to acquired resistance to these TKI. In addition, amplification of EGFR wild-type alleles but not mutant alleles was sufficient to confer acquired resistance. These findings underscore the importance of signals from wild-type EGFR alleles in acquiring resistance to mutant-selective EGFR-TKI. Our data provide evidence of wild-type allele-mediated resistance, a novel concept of acquired resistance in response to mutation-selective inhibitor therapy in cancer treatment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As genome sequencing becomes better integrated into scientific research, government policy, and personalized medicine, the primary challenge for researchers is shifting from generating raw data to analyzing these vast datasets. Although much work has been done to reduce compute times using various configurations of traditional CPU computing infrastructures, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) offer opportunities to accelerate genomic workflows by orders of magnitude. Here we benchmark one GPU-accelerated software suite called NVIDIA Parabricks on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and an NVIDIA DGX cluster. We benchmarked six variant calling pipelines, including two germline callers (HaplotypeCaller and DeepVariant) and four somatic callers (Mutect2, Muse, LoFreq, SomaticSniper). RESULTS: We achieved up to 65\,×\,acceleration with germline variant callers, bringing HaplotypeCaller runtimes down from 36~h to 33~min on AWS, 35~min on GCP, and 24~min on the NVIDIA DGX. Somatic callers exhibited more variation between the number of GPUs and computing platforms. On cloud platforms, GPU-accelerated germline callers resulted in cost savings compared with CPU runs, whereas some somatic callers were more expensive than CPU runs because their GPU acceleration was not sufficient to overcome the increased GPU cost. CONCLUSIONS: Germline variant callers scaled well with the number of GPUs across platforms, whereas somatic variant callers exhibited more variation in the number of GPUs with the fastest runtimes, suggesting that, at least with the version of Parabricks used here, these workflows are less GPU optimized and require benchmarking on the platform of choice before being deployed at production scales. Our study demonstrates that GPUs can be used to greatly accelerate genomic workflows, thus bringing closer to grasp urgent societal advances in the areas of biosurveillance and personalized medicine.},

Experimental Design:\hphantom{,}In vitro and in vivo pharmacologic activities of DS-8201a were evaluated and compared with T-DM1 in several HER2-positive cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The mechanism of action for the efficacy was also evaluated. Pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys and the safety profiles in rats and cynomolgus monkeys were assessed.             Results: DS-8201a exhibited a HER2 expression-dependent cell growth–inhibitory activity and induced tumor regression with a single dosing at more than 1 mg/kg in a HER2-positive gastric cancer NCI-N87 model. Binding activity to HER2 and ADCC activity of DS-8201a were comparable with unconjugated anti-HER2 antibody. DS-8201a also showed an inhibitory activity to Akt phosphorylation. DS-8201a induced phosphorylation of Chk1 and Histone H2A.X, the markers of DNA damage. Pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of DS-8201a were favorable and the highest non-severely toxic dose was 30 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, supporting DS-8201a as being well tolerated in humans. DS-8201a was effective in a T-DM1–insensitive PDX model with high HER2 expression. DS-8201a, but not T-DM1, demonstrated antitumor efficacy against several breast cancer PDX models with low HER2 expression.             Conclusions: DS-8201a exhibited a potent antitumor activity in a broad selection of HER2-positive models and favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. The results demonstrate that DS-8201a will be a valuable therapy with a great potential to respond to T-DM1–insensitive HER2-positive cancers and low HER2–expressing cancers.

HER2 is also overexpressed in subsets of patients with other solid tumours. Notably, the addition of trastuzumab to first-line chemotherapy has improved the overall survival of patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer, and has become the standard-of-care treatment for this group of patients. However, trials involving pertuzumab, lapatinib and T-DM1 have failed to provide significant improvements in the outcomes of patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.

  abstract = {Abstract Background Alectinib has shown a greater efficacy to ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancers in first-line setting; however, most patients relapse due to acquired resistance, such as secondary mutations in ALK including I1171N and G1202R. Although ceritinib or lorlatinib was shown to be effective to these resistant mutants, further resistance often emerges due to ALK-compound mutations in relapse patients following the use of ceritinib or lorlatinib. However, the drug for overcoming resistance has not been established yet. Methods We established lorlatinib-resistant cells harboring ALK-I1171N or -G1202R compound mutations by performing ENU mutagenesis screening or using an in vivo mouse model. We performed drug screening to overcome the lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutations. To evaluate these resistances in silico, we developed a modified computational molecular dynamic simulation (MP-CAFEE). Findings We identified 14 lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutants, including several mutants that were recently discovered in lorlatinib-resistant patients. Some of these compound mutants were found to be sensitive to early generation ALK-TKIs and several BCR-ABL inhibitors. Using our original computational simulation, we succeeded in demonstrating a clear linear correlation between binding free energy and in vitro experimental IC50 value of several ALK-TKIs to single- or compound-mutated EML4-ALK expressing Ba/F3 cells and in recapitulating the tendency of the binding affinity reduction by double mutations found in this study. Computational simulation revealed that ALK-L1256F single mutant conferred resistance to lorlatinib but increased the sensitivity to alectinib. Interpretation We discovered lorlatinib-resistant multiple ALK-compound mutations and an L1256F single mutation as well as the potential therapeutic strategies for these ALK mutations. Our original computational simulation to calculate the binding affinity may be applicable for predicting resistant mutations and for overcoming drug resistance in silico.

We assessed the performances of a workflow centered on CANOES, a bioinformatics tool based on read depth information. We applied our workflow to gene panel (GP) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data, and compared CNV calls to quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMSPF) or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) results. From GP data of 3776 samples, we reached an overall positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.8\%. This dataset included a complete comprehensive QMPSF comparison of four genes (60 exons) on which we obtained 100\% sensitivity and specificity. From WES data, we first compared 137 samples with aCGH and filtered comparable events (exonic CNVs encompassing enough aCGH probes) and obtained an 87.25\% sensitivity. The overall PPV was 86.4\% following the targeted confirmation of candidate CNVs from 1056 additional WES. In addition, our CANOES-centered workflow on WES data allowed the detection of CNVs with a resolution of single exons, allowing the detection of CNVs that were missed by aCGH. Overall, switching to an NGS-only approach should be cost-effective as it allows a reduction in overall costs together with likely stable diagnostic yields.

Experimental Design: We analyzed tumor biopsies from seven patients obtained before, during, and/or after treatment with AZD9291 or rociletinib (CO-1686). Targeted sequencing and FISH analyses were performed, and the relevance of candidate genes was functionally assessed in in vitro models. Results: We found recurrent amplification of either MET or ERBB2 in tumors that were resistant or developed resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and show that ERBB2 and MET activation can confer resistance to these compounds. Furthermore, we identified a KRASG12S mutation in a patient with acquired resistance to AZD9291 as a potential driver of acquired resistance. Finally, we show that dual inhibition of EGFR/MEK might be a viable strategy to overcome resistance in EGFR-mutant cells expressing mutant KRAS. Conclusions: Our data suggest that heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance can drive primary and acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and provide a rationale for potential combination strategies.

This idea has been supported by the unexpected findings that a subset of NSCLCs with mutated EGFR return as SCLC when resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors develops. Additionally, other case reports have described the coexistence of NSCLC and SCLC, further challenging the commonly accepted view of their distinct lineages. Here, we summarise the published clinical observations and biology underlying tumours with combined SCLC and NSCLC histology and cancers that transform from adenocarcinoma to SCLC. We also discuss pre-clinical studies pointing to common potential cells of origin, and speculate how the distinct paths of differentiation are determined by the genomics of each disease.}

Unfortunately, a majority of patients still undergo progressed disease after receiving osimertinib treatment. Acquired EGFR C797S mutation has been identified as one major mechanism; however, resistance mechanisms of remaining cases are still largely unknown. Methods: Using next generation sequencing (NGS) targeting 416 cancer-relevant genes, we analyzed the mutation profiles of 99 NSCLC patients that were clinically resistant to osimertinib. Results: In addition to the notable EGFR C797 variants (22\%), L792 mutations were identified in 10\% of patients, and a further 7\% cases carry L718 mutations. Further analysis of 14 patients with paired pre-treatment samples confirmed that these EGFR mutations were acquired during treatment. Interestingly, ...},

  abstract = {Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating EGFR mutations generally involve development of acquired secondary or tertiary EGFR mutations, such as T790M or C797S. However, case reports have demonstrated that actionable receptor tyrosine kinase fusions such as EML4-ALK, CCDC6-RET, and FGFR3-TACC3 can potentially confer resistance to EGFR TKIs. We seeked to identify the prevalence of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts as resistance mechanism to EGFR TKIs. Hybrid-capture based genomic profiling was performed on FFPE tissue samples and circulating tumor DNA isolated from peripheral whole blood in the course of clinical care. We performed a comprehensive survey of 17,319 clinical NSCLC samples (14,170 adenocarcinomas and 3149 NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS)) and identified 5 cases of FGFR3-TACC3 containing the intact kinase domain of FGFR3 and the coiled-coil domain of TACC3 emerging after treatment with EGFR TKIs, including one previously reported index case. Of the 4 novel cases of FGFR3-TACC3, one emerged after erlotinib, one after afatinib, one after osimertinib, and one after ASP8273. These 5 cases of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions acquired post-EGFR TKI, while rare, indicate that FGFR3-TACC3 is a recurrent resistance mechanism, which can bypass EGFR blockade by all generations of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC. Routine re-biopsy and genomic profiling using platforms capable of detecting kinase fusions has the potential to inform new therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC progressing on TKIs.},

A 69-year-old Caucasian female former light-smoker presented with stage IV EGFR L858R positive adenocarcinoma who developed EGFR T790M mutation after 8 month treatment of erlotinib. The patient was initiated on osimertinib with disease shrinkage after 2 months, but tumor regrowth was observed after 5 months of osimertinib treatment. Assay of plasma ctDNA at this time revealed these different secondary resistance mutations all in trans with each other including distinct mutations at the same codon producing different amino acid changes: G796S/R (mutant allele frequency [MAF]; 14.4\%), C797S/G (MAF: 2.26\%), L792F/H (MAF: 0.36\%), and V802F (MAF: 0.40\%), in addition to the pre-existing L858R (MAF:17.9\%) and T790M (MAF:18.2\%) but all in cis with T790M. The G796S/R mutations are homologous with known reported solvent front mutations in ALK G1202R, ROS1 G2032R, TrkA G595R and TrkC G623R, all of which are associated with acquired resistance to type I TKIs. In silico modeling revealed mutation at G796 interferes with osimertinib binding to the EGFR kinase domain at the phenyl aromatic ring position as this residue forms a narrow "hydrophobic sandwich" with L718, while L792F/H mutation interferes with osimertinib binding at the methoxyl group on the phenyl ring. Multiple resistance mutations at differing allele frequencies including novel EGFR solvent front mutations can emerge in a single patient with progression on osimertinib potentially due to tumor hetereogeneity and definitely present a significant therapeutic and drug development challenge.},

As such, the deep sequencing methods have resulted in the expansion of distinct fusion partners identified in ALK+ NSCLC to 90 (one variant PLEKHM2-ALK is found in small cell lung cancer but included in this catalog) by the end of January 2020; about 65 of them (since 2018) and most of the recent novel fusion partners were reported from China. Thirty-four of the distinct fusion partners are located on the short arm of chromosome 2; 28 of these 34 fusion partners are located on 2p21-25, in which ALK is located on 2p23.2-p23.1. Many of these new ALK+ NSCLC fusion variants have responded to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Several of these novel ALK fusion variants were identified as being resistant to EGFR TKIs or as dual 3'ALK fusions. In addition, at least 28 intergenic ALK rearrangements have also been reported, with three of them reported as responding to crizotinib. This review aims to serve as a central source of reference of fusion partners in ALK+ NSCLC for clinicians and scientists. We aim to update and improve the list going forward.}

  abstract = {Our current treatment paradigm of advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) classifies the six currently approved ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into three generations. The 2nd-generation (2G) and 3rd-generation (3G) ALK TKIs are all “single mutant active” with varying potencies across a wide spectrum of acquired single ALK resistance mutations. There is a vigorous debate among clinicians which is the best upfront ALK TKI is for the first-line (1L) treatment of ALK+ NSCLC and the subsequent sequencing strategies whether it should be based on the presence of specific on-target ALK resistance mutations or not. Regardless, sequential use of “single mutant active” ALK TKIs will eventually lead to double ALK resistance mutations in cis. This has led to the creation of fourth generation (4G) “double mutant active” ALK TKIs such as TPX-0131 and NVL-655. We discuss the critical properties 4G ALK TKIs must possess to be clinically successful. We proposed conceptual first-line, second-line, and molecularly-based third-line registrational randomized clinical trials designed for these 4G ALK TKIs. How these 4G ALK TKIs would be used in the future will depend on which line of treatment the clinical trial design(s) is adopted provided the trial is positive. If approved, 4G ALK TKIs may usher in a new treatment paradigm for advanced ALK+ NSCLC that is based on classifying ALK TKIs based on the intrinsic functional capabilities (“singe mutant active” versus “double mutant active”) rather than the loosely-defined “generational” (first-, second-,third-,fourth-) classification and avoid the current clinical approaches of seemingly random sequential use of 2G and 3G ALK TKIs.},

Acquired resistance to osimertinib is a growing clinical challenge that is poorly understood. Objective To understand the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib and their clinical behavior. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients with advanced NSCLC who received osimertinib for T790M-positive acquired resistance to prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor were identified from a multi-institutional cohort (n = 143) and a confirmatory trial cohort (NCT01802632) (n = 110). Next-generation sequencing of tumor biopsies after osimertinib resistance was performed. Genotyping of plasma cell-free DNA was studied as an orthogonal approach, including serial plasma samples when available. The study and analysis were finalized on November 9, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Mechanisms of resistance and their association with time to treatment discontinuation on osimertinib. Results Of the 143 patients evaluated, 41 (28 [68\%] women) had tumor next-generation sequencing after acquired resistance to osimertinib. Among 13 patients (32\%) with maintained T790M at the time of resistance,EGFRC797S was seen in 9 patients (22\%). Among 28 individuals (68\%) with loss of T790M, a range of competing resistance mechanisms was detected, including novel mechanisms such as acquiredKRASmutations and targetable gene fusions. Time to treatment discontinuation was shorter in patients with T790M loss (6.1 vs 15.2 months), suggesting emergence of pre-existing resistant clones; this finding was confirmed in a validation cohort of 110 patients with plasma cell-free DNA genotyping performed after osimertinib resistance. In studies of serial plasma levels of mutantEGFR, loss of T790M at resistance was associated with a smaller decrease in levels of theEGFRdriver mutation after 1 to 3 weeks of therapy (100\% vs 83\% decrease;P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance Acquired resistance to osimertinib mediated by loss of the T790M mutation is associated with early resistance and a range of competing resistance mechanisms. These data provide clinical evidence of the heterogeneity of resistance in advanced NSCLC and a need for clinical trial strategies that can overcome multiple concomitant resistance mechanisms or strategies for preventing such resistance.}

Patients and methods Patients with advanced EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer and disease progression on a prior EGFR-TKI were enrolled and allocated to dose-escalating cohorts combining osimertinib 80 mg orally (p.o.) once a day with selumetinib (25��75 mg p.o. twice a day; continuous or intermittent), savolitinib (600��800 mg p.o. once a day), or durvalumab (3��10 mg/kg intravenous every 2 weeks). Results At data cut-off (28 February 2018), 77 patients were enrolled and received osimertinib plus selumetinib (n = 36), savolitinib (n = 18), or durvalumab (n = 23). Most common adverse events (any grade), occurring in ��20\% of patients across dose groups, were: selumetinib arm�㺱iarrhea (75\%), rash (58\%), nausea (47\%); savolitinib arm�䒟ausea (67\%), rash (56\%), vomiting (50\%); durvalumab arm�㽣ash (48\%), vomiting (43\%), diarrhea (39\%). Dose-limiting toxicities were reported in the selumetinib 25 mg (n = 1), 50 mg (n = 1), and 75 mg (n = 4) continuous-dose groups, savolitinib 600 mg (n = 1) and 800 mg dose groups (n = 2), and durvalumab 10 mg/kg (n = 1) dose group.

Conclusion Our results demonstrate the feasibility of combining osimertinib 80 mg with selumetinib or savolitinib at identified tolerable, active doses. A combination of osimertinib with durvalumab was not feasible due to increased reporting of interstitial lung disease. Osimertinib-based combination therapies represent a compelling approach now being further investigated. Clinical trials number NCT02143466.}

  abstract = {Purpose: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients inevitably develop resistance to ALK-inhibitors. New diagnostic strategies are needed to assess resistance mechanisms and provide patients with the most effective therapy. We asked whether single-circulating tumor cell (CTC) sequencing can inform on resistance mutations to ALK-inhibitors and underlying tumor heterogeneity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Experimental Design: Resistance mutations were investigated in CTCs isolated at the single-cell level from patients at disease progression on crizotinib (n=14) or lorlatinib (n=3). Three strategies including filter laser-capture microdissection, fluorescence activated cell-sorting and the DEPArray were used. 126 CTC-pools and 56 single-CTCs were isolated and sequenced. Hotspots regions over 48 cancer-related genes and 14 ALK mutations were examined to identify ALK-independent and ALK-dependent resistance mechanisms. Results: Multiple mutations in various genes in ALK-independent pathways were predominantly identified in CTCs of crizotinib-resistant patients. The RTK-KRAS (EGFR, KRAS,BRAF genes) and TP53 pathways were recurrently mutated. In one lorlatinib-resistant patient, two single-CTCs out of 12 harbored ALK compound-mutations. CTC-1 harbored the ALKG1202R/F1174C compound-mutation virtually similar to ALKG1202R/F1174L present in the corresponding tumor biopsy. CTC-10 harbored a second ALKG1202R/T1151M compound-mutation not detected in the tumor biopsy. By copy-number analysis, CTC-1 and the tumor biopsy had similar profiles while CTC-10 harbored multiple copy-number alterations and whole-genome duplication. Conclusions: Our results highlight the genetic heterogeneity and clinical utility of CTCs to identify therapeutic resistance mutations in ALK-rearranged patients. Single-CTC sequencing may be a unique tool to assess heterogeneous resistance mechanisms and help clinicians for treatment personalization and resistance options to ALK-targeted therapies.}

Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients treated on the basis of liquid biopsy to determine the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status. Objectives: The objective was to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated based on EGFR mutation status, determined on a liquid biopsy. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective audit of prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent liquid biopsy EGFR mutation testing between July 2017 and January 2019 and received treatment based on that report. The primary end point was PFS defined as duration between the date of sample collection and disease progression or death, whereas OS was calculated as the interval between the date of sample collection and death. Kaplan�岞eier survival was used for the above two end points. Results: Out of 28 patients, 11 (39\%) were EGFR mutation positive, and 17 (61\%) were EGFR mutation negative. The median age was 62 years, with 15 out of the 28 being females (54\%). Nine (82\%) and 13 (76\%) patients had performance status (PS) 2 or 3 in the EGFR mutation-positive and EGFR mutation-negative cohorts, respectively. In the EGFR mutation-positive cohort, 4 (36\%) were exon 19, 6 (54\%) were exon 21, and 1 (9\%) was T790M positive. After receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors or physician's choice of chemotherapy in EGFR mutation-positive and negative cohorts, the response rates were 63\% and 12\%, respectively. The median follow-up was 14 months (range: 10��17 months). The median PFS was 8 months versus 2 months (P = 0.002), whereas the median OS was 17 months versus 5 months (P = 0.004) in the EGFR mutation-positive and EGFR mutation-negative cohorts, respectively. Conclusion: In patients with advanced NSCLC in whom a tissue biopsy is not feasible, especially in older, poor PS patients, treatment based on the results of liquid biopsy gives comparable outcomes to those of a tissue-based biopsy.}

We found from sequencing the EGFR TK domain that 7 of 10 gefitinib-sensitive tumors had similar types of alterations; no mutations were found in eight gefitinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.004). Five of seven tumors sensitive to erlotinib (Tarceva), a related kinase inhibitor for which the clinically relevant target is undocumented, had analogous somatic mutations, as opposed to none of 10 erlotinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.003). Because most mutation-positive tumors were adenocarcinomas from patients who smoked {$<$}100 cigarettes in a lifetime ("never smokers"), we screened EGFR exons 2-28 in 15 adenocarcinomas resected from untreated never smokers. Seven tumors had TK domain mutations, in contrast to 4 of 81 non-small cell lung cancers resected from untreated former or current smokers (P = 0.0001). Immunoblotting of lysates from cells transiently transfected with various EGFR constructs demonstrated that, compared to wild-type protein, an exon 19 deletion mutant induced diminished levels of phosphotyrosine, whereas the phosphorylation at tyrosine 1092 of an exon 21 point mutant was inhibited at 10-fold lower concentrations of drug. Collectively, these data show that adenocarcinomas from never smokers comprise a distinct subset of lung cancers, frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity.}

  abstract = {Mutant-selective, 3rd-generation EGFR-TKIs were recently developed to control lung cancer cells harboring T790M-mediated resistance. However, the development of resistance to these novel drugs seems inevitable. Thus, we investigated the mechanism of acquired resistance to the mutant-selective EGFR-TKI WZ4002. We established five WZ4002-resistant cells, derived from cells harboring both EGFR and T790M mutations by long-term exposure to increasing doses of WZ4002. Compared with the parental cells, all resistant cells showed 10-100-folds higher resistance to WZ4002, as well as cross-resistance to other mutant-selective inhibitors. Among them, three resistant cells (HCC827/WR, PC-9/WR and H1975/WR) showed dependency on EGFR signaling, but two other cells (PC-9/GR/WR and PC-9/ER/WR) were not. Notably, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) was aberrantly activated in PC-9/GR/WR cells in phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array, consistently accompanied by loss of IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP3). Down-regulation of IGF1R by shRNA, as well as inhibition of IGF1R activity either by AG-1024 (a small molecule IGF1R inhibitor) or BI 836845 (a monoclonal anti-IGF1/2 blocking antibody), restored the sensitivity to WZ4002 both in vitro and xenograft. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of the IGF1R pathway associated with IGFBP3 loss can induce an acquired resistance to the mutant-selective EGFR-TKI, WZ4002. Therefore, a combined therapy of IGF1R inhibitors and mutant-selective EGFR-TKIs might be a viable treatment strategy for overcoming acquired resistance.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion (Exon20ins) mutations exhibits inherent resistance to approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Amivantamab, an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell–directing activity, binds to each receptor’s extracellular domain, bypassing resistance at the tyrosine kinase inhibitor binding site. METHODS CHRYSALIS is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study, which included a population with EGFR Exon20ins NSCLC. The primary end points were dose-limiting toxicity and overall response rate. We report findings from the postplatinum EGFR Exon20ins NSCLC population treated at the recommended phase II dose of 1,050 mg amivantamab (1,400 mg, \$ 80 kg) given once weekly for the first 4 weeks and then once every 2 weeks starting at week 5.

Accepted on June 28, 2021 and published at ascopubs.org/journal/ jco on August 2, 2021: DOI https://doi. org/10.1200/JCO.21. 00662 RESULTS In the efficacy population (n 5 81), the median age was 62 years (range, 42-84 years); 40 patients (49\%) were Asian, and the median number of previous lines of therapy was two (range, 1-7). The overall response rate was 40\% (95\% CI, 29 to 51), including three complete responses, with a median duration of response of 11.1 months (95\% CI, 6.9 to not reached). The median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (95\% CI, 6.5 to 10.9). In the safety population (n 5 114), the most common adverse events were rash in 98 patients (86\%), infusion-related reactions in 75 (66\%), and paronychia in 51 (45\%). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypokalemia in six patients (5\%) and rash, pulmonary embolism, diarrhea, and neutropenia in four (4\%) each. Treatment-related dose reductions and discontinuations were reported in 13\% and 4\% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSION Amivantamab, via its novel mechanism of action, yielded robust and durable responses with tolerable safety in patients with EGFR Exon20ins mutations after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy.

Osimertinib (80 mg), a third-generation, irreversible, oral EGFR TKI, has shown efficacy in active CNS metastases. However, efficacy of osimertinib 160 mg in BM or LM is unclear. Patients and methods This prospective, single-arm, two cohort study evaluated the efficacy of osimertinib 160 mg in T790M-positive BM or LM NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR TKI (NCT03257124) treatment. The primary end points were objective response rate (ORR) (H1 = 30\%) for the BM cohort and overall survival (OS) (H1 = 5 months) for the LM cohort. Results The median follow-up duration was 10.1 months and 9.6 months for the BM and LM cohorts, respectively. In the BM cohort, intracranial ORR and disease control rate were 55.0\% and 77.5\%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.6 months [95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.0��16.6]; the median OS was 16.9 months [95\% CI 7.9�忛ot reached (NR)]. In the LM cohort, intracranial disease control rate was 92.5\% and complete response rate was 12.5\%. The median OS was 13.3 months (95\% CI 9.1�幞R); the median PFS was 8.0 months (95\% CI 7.2�幞R). Subgroup analyses based on previous exposure to T790M-targeting agents, including osimertinib 80 mg or other third-generation EGFR TKIs, showed no difference in PFS in both the BM (n = 18, P = 0.39) and LM (n = 17, P = 0.85) cohorts. Previous radiotherapy favored PFS in the BM cohort (hazard ratio 0.42, P = 0.04). The most common adverse events were decreased appetite, diarrhea, and skin rash; however, most were grade 1��2. Conclusion Thus, osimertinib 160 mg demonstrated promising ORR and survival benefit with a tolerable safety profile in EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC patients with CNS metastasis who progressed on prior EGFR TKIs.}

In this study, we investigated whether ALK, which is expressed at high levels in lymphoma cells, could be a target for antigen-specific cell-mediated immunotherapy. A panel of ALK-derived peptides was tested for their binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules. Binding peptides were assessed for their capacity to elicit a specific immune response mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) both in vivo, in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice, and in vitro in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy donors. Two HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes, p280-89 (SLAMLDLLHV) and p375-86 (GVLLWEIFSL), both located in the ALK kinase domain were identified. The p280-89- and p375-86-induced peptide-specific CTL lines were able to specifically release interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on stimulation with ALK peptide-pulsed autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells (LCLs) or T2 cells. Anti-ALK CTLs lysed HLA-matched ALCL and neuroblastoma cell lines endogenously expressing ALK proteins. CTL activity was inhibited by anti-HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody CR11.351, consistent with a class I-restricted mechanism of cytotoxicity. These results show the existence of functional anti-ALK CTL precursors within the peripheral T-cell repertoire of healthy donors, clearly indicating ALK as a tumor antigen and ALK-derived peptides, p280-89 and p375-86, as suitable epitopes for the development of vaccination strategies.}

In the small number of patients enrolled, elevated transaminases were the most common treatment-related toxicity. No other relevant toxicities were observed. Although no definitive conclusions could be drawn because of the small number of patients studied, the higher frequency of severe transaminase increases noted in this sample should be of concern if ALK inhibitor and PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitor combinations are tested in future studies. Background Previous research suggests single-agent crizotinib is efficacious for the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods This study evaluated the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of crizotinib plus pembrolizumab as first-line therapy in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Patients were initially treated at dose level 0 (DL0) with crizotinib 250 mg twice daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (cycle duration was 3 weeks). If a dose-limiting toxicity occurred, subsequent patients were enrolled at a lower dose level (dose level -1 [DL-1]: 3 weeks of crizotinib monotherapy 250 mg twice daily, followed by crizotinib 250 mg twice daily with the addition of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity. Antitumor activity was assessed. Results Nine patients were enrolled: two at DL0, then seven at DL-1. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in four patients (grade 3 increases in alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and grade 3 fatigue at DL0; grade 3 increase in ALT and grade 3 increases in both ALT and AST at DL-1).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: CUPISCO is an ongoing randomized phase II trial (NCT03498521) comparing molecularly guided therapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients newly diagnosed with "unfavorable" cancer of unknown primary (CUP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with an unfavorable CUP diagnosis, as defined by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and available cancer tissue for molecular sequencing are generally eligible. Potential patients with CUP entering screening undergo a review involving reference histopathology and clinical work-up by a central eligibility review team (ERT). Patients with "favorable" CUP, a strongly suspected primary site of origin, lack of tissue, or unmet inclusion criteria are excluded. RESULTS: As of April 30, 2020, 628 patients had entered screening and 346 (55.1\%) were screen failed. Screen fails were due to technical reasons (n =\,89), failure to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria not directly related to CUP diagnosis (n =\,89), and other reasons (n =\,33). A total of 124 (35.8\%) patients were excluded because unfavorable adeno- or poorly differentiated CUP could not be confirmed by the ERT. These cases were classified into three groups ineligible because of (a) histologic subtype, such as squamous and neuroendocrine, or favorable CUP; (b) evidence of a possible primary tumor; or (c) noncarcinoma histology. CONCLUSION: Experience with CUPISCO has highlighted challenges with standardized screening in an international clinical trial and the difficulties in diagnosing unfavorable CUP. Reconfirmation of unfavorable CUP by an ERT in a clinical trial can result in many reasons for screen failures. By sharing this experience, we aim to foster understanding of diagnostic challenges and improve diagnostic pathology and clinical CUP algorithms. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A high unmet need exists for improved treatment of cancer of unknown primary (CUP); however, study in a trial setting is faced with the significant challenge of definitively distinguishing CUP from other cancer types. This article reports the authors' experience of this challenge so far in the ongoing CUPISCO trial, which compares treatments guided by patients' unique genetic signatures versus standard chemotherapy. The data presented will aid future decision-making regarding diagnosing true CUP cases; this will have far-reaching implications in the design, execution, and interpretation of not only CUPISCO but also future clinical studies aiming to find much-needed treatment strategies.},

In order to evaluate the most effective testing approach for LuAD targetable gene fusion detection, we analyzed 210 NSCLC selected clinical samples, comparing in situ (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization, FISH, and ImmunoHistoChemistry, IHC) and molecular (targeted RNA Next-Generation Sequencing, NGS, and RealTime-PCR, RT-PCR) approaches. The overall concordance among these methods was high ({$>$}90\%), and targeted RNA NGS was confirmed to be the most efficient technique for gene fusion identification in clinical practice, allowing the simultaneous analysis of a large set of genomic rearrangements at the RNA level. However, we observed that FISH was useful to detect targetable fusions in those samples with inadequate tissue material for molecular testing as well as in those few cases whose fusions were not identified by the RNA NGS panel. We conclude that the targeted RNA NGS analysis of LuADs allows accurate RTK fusion detection; nevertheless, standard methods such as FISH should not be dismissed, as they can crucially contribute to the completion of the molecular characterization of LuADs and, most importantly, the identification of patients as candidates for targeted therapies.}

DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, LILACS, CINAHL, and SCOPUS for prospective or retrospective studies reporting data on overall survival for left-sided colon cancer (LCC) compared with right-sided colon cancer (RCC). STUDY SELECTION Studies were selected if: (1) side of CC was reported among variables entered into survival analysis, (2) survival information was available (overall survival [OS] was reported in the article as hazard ratio (HR) according to multivariate analysis, (3) articles were published in the English language. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were pooled using HRs for OS of LCC vs RCC according to fixed or random-effects models. Subgroup analysis and multivariate random-effects model meta-regression was also implemented adjusting for stage distribution, sample size, race, year of publication, type and quality of studies, and adjuvant chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES HRs for OS (the primary outcome measure) were pooled to provide an aggregate value. In this analysis, all HRs with 95\% CIs were pooled to obtain prognostic information on the location of the primary tumor (left vs right location site of CC) independent of other common clinicopathological covariates. RESULTS An analysis was made from the 66 studies conducted. It included 1 437 846 patients with a median follow-up of 65 months. Left sided primary tumor location was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death (HR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.84; P {$<$} .001) and this was independent of stage, race, adjuvant chemotherapy, year of study, number of participants, and quality of included studies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on these results, CC side should be acknowledged as a criterion for establishing prognosis in all stages of disease. It should be considered when deciding treatment intensity in metastatic settings, and should represent a stratification factor for future adjuvant studies.},

  abstract = {9513 Background: EGFR exon 20 insertions (ins20), which comprise 4-10\% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC, are generally refractory to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs. While the clinical activity of the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib against EGFR ins20 is unknown, preclinical studies suggest its favorable therapeutic window may allow for inhibition of EGFR isn20 at clinically-achievable doses (Hirano, Oncotarget 2015). We report the results of EA5162, a single-arm, phase II study of osimertinib 160 mg in NSCLC pts with EGFR ins20 (NCT03191149). Methods: Pts with advanced NSCLC with an EGFR ins20 mutation identified by any local, CLIA-certified tissue assay were treated with osimertinib 160 mg daily until progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal. At least one prior line of therapy was required; stable, asymptomatic brain metastases were allowed. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. The estimated sample size was 19 patients. Results: 21 pts were enrolled between 4/2018 and 7/2019 (median age 65; 15 female, 6 male; median 2 prior therapies); 1 patient did not meet eligibility criteria due to laboratory studies obtained 1 day out of window. As of 1/21/20, 6 pts remain on treatment. Among the 20 eligible pts, the best response was PR in 4 pts and CR in one pt, for a confirmed ORR of 25\%; 12 (60\%) pts had SD. The median PFS was 9.7 months (95\% CI, 4.07, NA), median duration of response (DOR) was 5.7 months (95\% CI, 4.73, NA.) Grade {$>$} 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) observed in {$>$} 1 pt included anemia (n=2), fatigue (n=2), prolonged QT interval (n=2.) One pt had grade 4 respiratory failure, there were no grade 5 TRAEs. One pt discontinued study treatment due to grade 3 anemia. Conclusions: Osimertinib 160mg daily is well-tolerated and showed clinical activity in EGFR ins20-mutant NSCLC with a response rate of 25\%, disease control rate of 85\%, and mPFS of 9.7 months. The adverse events with osimertinib 160 mg QD in this cohort were consistent with other reports of this regimen; grade 3 rash and diarrhea were not observed.

While RET fusions have been identified in resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC, their role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors is not well described. To assess the biological implications of RET fusions in an EGFR-mutant cancer, we expressed CCDC6-RET in PC9 (EGFR del19) and MGH134 (EGFR L858R/T790M) cells and found that CCDC6-RET was sufficient to confer resistance to EGFR-TKIs. The selective RET inhibitors BLU-667 or cabozantinib resensitized CCDC6-RET-expressing cells to EGFR inhibition. Finally, we treated two patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and RET-mediated resistance with osimertinib and BLU-667. The combination was well-tolerated and led to rapid radiographic response in both patients. This study provides proof-of-concept that RET fusions can mediate acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs and that combined EGFR and RET inhibition with osimertinib/BLU-667 may be a well-tolerated and effective treatment strategy for such patients.}

  abstract = {Abstract Background AZD9291 is an oral, irreversible, mutant-selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), which specifically targets both sensitizing and resistant T790M mutations. This compound has shown outstanding activity, in a phase I/II (AURA) trial. However, despite impressive tumor responses in T790M-positive patients, acquired resistance to this drug limits the benefit of this compound. Mutations at the EGFR C797 codon, located within the kinase-binding site, were very recently reported to be a potential mechanism of resistance to AZD9291 in T790M-positive patients. Patients and methods To identify potential mechanisms of resistance to AZD9291, we report here on two patients with resistant biopsy specimens that had been treated with AZD9291. Results We identified in two distinct cases, HER2 and MET amplification by FISH and CGH as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKI. Interestingly, this event occurred with complete loss of the T790M mutation. In one case, we observed a different molecular status at two biopsy sites (the T790M mutation at the primary site and wild-type T790M at the metastatic site with different pathways of acquired resistance to AZD9291). Conclusion Our observations suggest that T790M-positive and wild-type T790M clones may coexist at baseline. AZD9291 efficiently suppresses the growth of T790M-positive cells, but a population of wild-type T790M cells at baseline will mediate the development of resistance, here via a by-pass pathway activating either HER2 or MET.}

  abstract = {Abstract             With the identification of activating mutations in BRAF across a wide variety of malignancies, substantial effort was placed in designing safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target BRAF. These efforts have led to the development and regulatory approval of three BRAF inhibitors as well as five combinations of a BRAF inhibitor plus an additional agent(s) to manage cancer such as melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer. To date, each regimen is effective only in patients with tumors harboring BRAFV600 mutations and the duration of benefit is often short-lived. Further limitations preventing optimal management of BRAF-mutant malignancies are that treatments of non-V600 BRAF mutations have been less profound and combination therapy is likely necessary to overcome resistance mechanisms, but multi-drug regimens are often too toxic. With the emergence of a deeper understanding of how BRAF mutations signal through the RAS/MAPK pathway, newer RAF inhibitors are being developed that may be more effective and potentially safer and more rational combination therapies are being tested in the clinic. In this review, we identify the mechanics of RAF signaling through the RAS/MAPK pathway, present existing data on single-agent and combination RAF targeting efforts, describe emerging combinations, summarize the toxicity of the various agents in clinical testing, and speculate as to where the field may be headed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Introduction: T-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of an anti-HER2 antibody, cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a membrane-permeable topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. In patients (pts) with HER2-expressing or -mutated solid tumors, T-DXd has demonstrated strong antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile and is approved for treatment (tx) of pts with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (BC) that has progressed on ≥2 anti-HER2 therapies (US) or after chemotherapy (Japan); ILD is an important identified risk. We further characterize ILD in a pooled analysis of 8 single arm phase 1 and 2 T-DXd monotherapy studies.             Methods: Pts who received ≥1 dose of T-DXd monotherapy 5.4 mg/kg or higher across 8 single-arm studies were included (between Aug 28, 2015 and the data cutoff June 08, 2020). Potential ILD cases had imaging and clinical data (baseline through the time of ILD case) retrospectively reviewed by an independent adjudication committee to assess whether the reported ILD event was study drug related; events adjudicated as study drug related are reported.             Results: 879 pts were included; 510 with BC, 148 with lung cancer, 107 with colorectal cancer, 78 with gastric cancer, and 34 with other cancers (2 had missing tumor type). Median tx duration was 6.9 mo (range, 0.7-50.1 mo); 139 pts (15.8\%) experienced an adjudicated ILD event, most were grade (G) 1/2 (G1/2=108 [12.3\%]; G3=9 [1.0\%]; G4=1 [0.1\%]; G5=21 [2.4\%]). Among pts treated with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg (n=315), 48 (15.2\%) experienced an ILD event (G1/2=39 [12.4\%]; G3=2 [0.6\%]; G4=1 [0.3\%]; G5=6 [1.9\%]). Additional details on ILD events by dose and tumor type will be presented. Among adjudicated ILD events (any grade), the onset date as assessed by investigator was delayed compared with the adjudication committee-assessed date in 71 cases (median difference in onset date, 49 d [range, 1-288 d]). The majority of ILD events occurred in the initial 12 mo of tx. After 12 mo the risk of new onset of ILD decreased with a conditional probability of developing ILD of 7.0\% in pts treated to month 12 without ILD and 1.4\% in pts treated to month 18 without ILD, which was likely driven by pts with longer tx duration in the BC cohort; however, additional follow-up is required to confirm these observations. Data on the use of steroids to manage ILD will be presented.             Conclusion: Pooled analysis showed that most ILD events were low grade (78\% of pts with ILD had G1/2 events) and occurred in the first 12 mo of tx, with lowered risk for pts on tx \&gt; 12 mo. The adjudication committee identified ILD earlier than investigators in 48\% of cases suggesting opportunity for early detection and intervention. Close monitoring, prompt recognition, and proactive management of ILD using current management guidelines may help to improve ILD outcomes.             Citation Format: Charles A.

The possibility that ALK proteins are immunogenic was investigated with the use of an immunocytochemical technique to screen plasma from ALK-positive ALCL on transfectants expressing ALK proteins and by an in vitro kinase assay. Circulating antibodies against NPM-ALK protein were present in all ALK-positive ALCL patients (11 out of 11 cases) studied while 10 patients also had antibodies recognizing normal ALK protein. Weak antibodies reactive with NPM-ALK (which may represent anti-NPM autoantibodies) were detected by the in vitro kinase assay in 3 of the 10 control samples (but not by immunocytochemistry). The presence of anti-ALK antibodies may be relevant to the relatively good prognosis of ALK-positive ALCL. The immunocytochemical technique for detecting anti-ALK activity is simple and semiquantative and may provide a means of detecting B-cell responses to other tumor-associated molecules.

To our knowledge, the TAILOR trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01228734) is the first randomized, multicenter, phase III study of the addition of cetuximab to first-line FOLFOX prospectively choosing a RAS wt population and thus providing confirmative data for the efficacy and safety of cetuximab plus FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TAILOR is an open-label, randomized (1:1), multicenter, phase III trial in patients from China comparing FOLFOX-4 with or without cetuximab in RAS wt (KRAS/NRAS, exons 2 to 4) mCRC. The primary end point of TAILOR was progression-free survival time; secondary end points included overall survival time, overall response rate, and safety and tolerability. RESULTS: In the modified intent-to-treat population of 393 patients with RAS wt mCRC, adding cetuximab to FOLFOX-4 significantly improved the primary end point of progression-free survival time compared with FOLFOX-4 alone (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.54 to 0.89; P = .004; median, 9.2 v 7.4 months, respectively), as well as the secondary end points of overall survival time (current assessment after 300 events: hazard ratio, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.61 to 0.96; P = .02; median, 20.7 v 17.8 months, respectively) and overall response rate (odds ratio, 2.41; 95\% CI, 1.61 to 3.61; P {$<$} .001; 61.1\% v 39.5\%, respectively). Treatment was well tolerated, and there were no new or unexpected safety findings. CONCLUSION: The TAILOR study met all of its objectives and relevant clinical end points, confirming cetuximab in combination with FOLFOX as an effective standard-of-care first-line treatment regimen for patients with RAS wt mCRC.},

More than 40\,years later, even in the era of precision medicine and immunotherapy, Pt drugs remain among the most widely used anticancer drugs. As Pt drugs mainly target DNA, it is not surprising that recent insights into alterations of DNA repair mechanisms provide a useful explanation for their success. Many cancers have defective DNA repair, a feature that also sheds new light on the mechanisms of secondary drug resistance, such as the restoration of DNA repair pathways. In addition, genome-wide functional screening approaches have revealed interesting insights into Pt drug uptake. About half of cisplatin and carboplatin but not oxaliplatin may enter cells through the widely expressed volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). The analysis of this heteromeric channel in tumour biopsies may therefore be a useful biomarker to stratify patients for initial Pt treatments. Moreover, Pt-based approaches may be improved in the future by the optimization of combinations with immunotherapy, management of side effects and use of nanodelivery devices. Hence, Pt drugs may still be part of the standard of care for several cancers in the coming years.},

However, treatment can prolong life, delay the progression of the cancer, or improve quality of life. Currently, patients with mBC are often treated with chemotherapy. Patients often experience adverse events from chemotherapy during the treatment cycle, which leads to chemotherapy modifications such as dose delay, dose reduction, or discontinuation of chemotherapy. Previous studies have evaluated the rates of adverse events that occur from the use of chemotherapy; however, few studies have evaluated the clinical impact on the chemotherapy regimen once the adverse event occurs. This study evaluates the clinical impact on the chemotherapy regimen from chemotherapy-related adverse events in patients with mBC in an integrated health care delivery system.

  abstract = {Purpose: Lorlatinib is a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor with proven efficacy in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer previously treated with first- and second-generation ALK inhibitors. Beside compound mutations in the ALK kinase domain, other resistance mechanisms driving lorlatinib resistance remain unknown. We aimed to characterize the mechanisms of resistance to lorlatinib occurring in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer and design new therapeutic strategies in this setting. Experimental Design: Resistance mechanisms were investigated in 5 patients resistant to lorlatinib. Longitudinal tumor biopsies were studied using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Patient-derived models were developed to characterize the acquired resistance mechanisms, and Ba/F3 cell mutants were generated to study the effect of novel ALK compound mutations. Drug combinatory strategies were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to overcome lorlatinib resistance. Results: Diverse biological mechanisms leading to lorlatinib resistance were identified. Epithelial�𢘫esenchymal transition (EMT) mediated resistance in two patient-derived cell lines and was susceptible to dual SRC and ALK inhibition. We characterized three ALK kinase domain compound mutations occurring in patients, L1196M/D1203N, F1174L/G1202R, and C1156Y/G1269A, with differential susceptibility to ALK inhibition by lorlatinib. We identified a novel bypass mechanism of resistance caused by NF2 loss-of-function mutations, conferring sensitivity to treatment with mTOR inhibitors. Conclusions: This study shows that mechanisms of resistance to lorlatinib are diverse and complex, requiring new therapeutic strategies to tailor treatment upon disease progression.}

In the past few years, this strategy has been challenged by~clinical evidence showing improved progression-free survival, improved intracranial disease control and a generally favourable toxicity profile when next-generation EGFR and ALK TKIs are used in the first-line setting. In this Review, we describe the existing preclinical and clinical evidence supporting both treatment strategies — the ‘historical’ sequential treatment strategy and the use of next-generation TKIs — as frontline therapies and discuss the suitability of both strategies for patients with EGFR-driven or ALK-driven NSCLC.},

In order to characterize OPD in immunotherapy (IO)-treated NSCLC, we analyzed the failure pattern under PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (n = 297) or chemoimmunotherapy (n = 75). Under IO monotherapy, OPD was more frequent (20\% vs. 10\%, p {$<$} 0.05), occurred later (median 11 vs. 5 months, p {$<$} 0.01), affected fewer sites (mean 1.1 vs. 1.5, p {$<$} 0.05), and involved fewer lesions (1.4 vs. 2.3, p {$<$} 0.05) in the first compared to later lines. Lymph nodes (42\%, mainly mediastinal) and the brain (39\%) were mostly affected, followed by the lung (24\%) and other organs. Compared to multifocal progression, OPD occurred later (11 vs. 4 months, p {$<$} 0.001) and was associated with longer survival (26 vs. 13 months, p {$<$} 0.001) and higher tumor PD-L1 expression (p {$<$} 0.001). Chemoimmunotherapy showed a similar incidence of OPD as IO monotherapy (13\% vs. 11\% at 2 years). Local treatments were applied regularly for brain but only in 50\% for extracranial lesions. Thus, NSCLC oligoprogression is less common under IO than under TKI, but also favorable. Since its frequency drops later in the disease, regular restaging and multidisciplinary evaluation are essential in order to exploit the full therapeutic potential.}

Dose escalation identified 160 mg/d as the recommended phase 2 dose and maximum tolerated dose. Among 136 patients treated with 160 mg/d, the most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAE; \&gt;25\%) were diarrhea (83\%), nausea (43\%), rash (33\%), and vomiting (26\%), with diarrhea (21\%) the only grade ≥3 TRAE \&gt;5\%. Among 28 EGFRex20ins patients treated at 160 mg/d, the investigator-assessed confirmed response rate was 43\% (12/28; 95\% confidence interval, 24\%–63\%) with median duration of response of 14 months (5.0–not reached) and median progression-free survival of 7.3 months (4.4–15.6).

These mutations are predictive of poor prognosis in resected disease as well as resistance to treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined the frequency and type of KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations and characterized their association with cigarette smoking history in patients with lung adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: KRAS mutational analysis was done on 482 lung adenocarcinomas, 81 (17\%) of which were obtained from patients who had never smoked cigarettes. KRAS mutations were found in 15\% (12 of 81; 95\% confidence intervals, 8-24\%) of tumors from never smokers. Similarly, 22\% (69 of 316; 95\% confidence intervals, 17-27\%) of tumors from former smokers, and 25\% (21 of 85; 95\% confidence intervals, 16-35\%) of tumors from current smokers had KRAS mutations. The frequency of KRAS mutation was not associated with age, gender, or smoking history. The number of pack years of cigarette smoking did not predict an increased likelihood of KRAS mutations. Never smokers were significantly more likely than former or current smokers to have a transition mutation (G--{$>$}A) rather than the transversion mutations known to be smoking-related (G--{$>$}T or G--{$>$}C; P {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our data, KRAS mutations are not rare among never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma and such patients have a distinct KRAS mutation profile. The etiologic and biological heterogeneity of KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas is worthy of further study.},

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction EGFR exon 20 insertions (EGFRex20ins) comprise an uncommon subset of EGFR-activating alterations relatively insensitive to first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, recent early clinical data suggests these patients may benefit from newer-generation EGFR-TKIs. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) identifies a broad spectrum of EGFRex20ins and associated co-occurring genomic alterations (GAs) present in NSCLC. Methods Hybrid capture-based CGP was performed prospectively on 14,483 clinically annotated consecutive NSCLC specimens to a mean coverage depth of greater than 650X for 236 or 315 cancer-related genes. Results Of 14,483 NSCLC cases, CGP identified 263 (1.8\%) cases with EGFRex20ins, representing 12\% (263 of 2251) of cases with EGFR mutations. Sixty-four unique EGFRex20ins were identified, most commonly D770\_N771{$>$}ASVDN (21\%) and N771\_P772{$>$}SVDNP (20\%). EGFR amplification occurred in 22\% (57 of 263). The most common co-occurring GAs effected tumor protein p53 (TP53) (56\%), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (22\%), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B) (16\%), NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1) (14\%) and RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) (11\%); co-occurring GAs in other known lung cancer drivers were rare (5\%). Average tumor mutational burden was low (mean 4.3, range 0 to 40.3 mutations/Mb). Clinical outcomes to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs were obtained for five patients and none responded. Conclusions In the largest series of EGFRex20ins NSCLC, diverse EGFRex20ins were detected in 12\% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC, a higher frequency than previously reported in smaller single-institution studies. Clinical outcomes showed lack of response to EGFR TKIs. Tumor mutational burden was low, consistent with non–smoking associated NSCLC. Comprehensive sequencing revealed increased proportion and wide variety of EGFRex20ins, representing a population of patients significant enough for focused efforts on effective interventions.}

Here we present the first large-scale survey of tyrosine kinase activity in lung cancer. Using a phosphoproteomic approach, we characterize tyrosine kinase signaling across 41 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and over 150 NSCLC tumors. Profiles of phosphotyrosine signaling are generated and analyzed to identify known oncogenic kinases such as EGFR and c-Met as well as novel ALK and ROS fusion proteins. Other activated tyrosine kinases such as PDGFR帢 and DDR1 not previously implicated in the genesis of NSCLC are also identified. By focusing on activated cell circuitry, the approach outlined here provides insight into cancer biology not available at the chromosomal and transcriptional levels and can be applied broadly across all human cancers.}

Of these, 141 were treated prior to the reporting of AOD with chemotherapy (C), immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), or both. This report details the clinical outcomes of these 141 compared to the 384 treated after AOD reported. Methods: Real world data (RWD) were obtained from a curated ICD for pts with NSCLC 4 diagnosed 1/1/2018-12/31/2020 with cutoff of data 3/31/2021. Pts with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, HER2, and NTRK were included if their treatment record were captured. Also included were demographics, ECOG score, date of first report of AOD and dates of initiations of first and any second line of therapy and date of apparent death (AD). Outcome measures were time to next treatment or apparent death (TTNT) and apparent survival (AS) (ICD model does not allow date of death per HIPAA de-identified Expert Determination). Descriptive statistics were used with Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates and Hazard Ratios (HR) by Cox regression. 3 cohorts were defined: Group (Gr) A with 384 pts treated after AOD reported and used as the comparator; the 141 pts treated before AOD with C, ICI or both were divided into Gr B (n = 51) who subsequently switched to TKI within 35 days and Gr C (n = 90) who did not switch. Results: As shown in data table, AS was significantly worse in Gr B and Gr C, TTNT was significantly worse in Gr C and with worsening trend in Gr B. Two potential confounders were identified: higher ECOG scores might indicate more urgency to assign treatment, but pts with ECOG ≥ 2 were similar in all 3 groups; also, difference in proportion of EGFRm by Group (Gr A 62\%, Gr B 57\%, and Gr C 29\%), but separating cohorts by EGFR mutation status did not alter results. Conclusions: While subject to the limitations of a retrospective observational RWD study, this study strongly suggests outcomes are significantly compromised in pts harboring AOD but who are treated initially with C, ICI or both, even in pts quickly switched to TKI. Since a prospective clinical trial is not ethically feasible, these findings may stimulate review of current guidelines, fuel optimization of universal testing in NSCLC 4, and encourage utilization of liquid or ultra-fast NGS with their rapid turnaround times in order to improve survival in this setting.

Here we characterize the mutational landscape in 16,715 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and establish the structure–function relationship of EGFR mutations on drug sensitivity. We found that EGFR mutations can be separated into four distinct subgroups on the basis of sensitivity and structural changes that retrospectively predict patient outcomes following treatment with EGFR inhibitors better than traditional exon-based groups. Together, these data delineate a structure-based approach for defining functional groups of EGFR mutations that can effectively guide treatment and clinical trial choices for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and suggest that a structure–function-based approach may improve the prediction of drug sensitivity to targeted therapies in oncogenes with diverse mutations.},

We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo testing to model structural alterations induced by exon 20 mutations and to identify effective inhibitors. 3D modeling indicated alterations restricted the size of the drug-binding pocket, limiting the binding of large, rigid inhibitors. We found that poziotinib, owing to its small size and flexibility, can circumvent these steric changes and is a potent inhibitor of the most common EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutants. Poziotinib demonstrated greater activity than approved EGFR TKIs in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models of EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutant NSCLC and in genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC. In a phase 2 trial, the first 11 patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations receiving poziotinib had a confirmed objective response rate of 64\%. These data identify poziotinib as a potent, clinically active inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutations and illuminate the molecular features of TKIs that may circumvent steric changes induced by these mutations.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Introduction: In 1999, the NCCN published its first NHL CPG and in 2000, established the NCCN NHL Outcomes Database Project to monitor patterns of care, CPG concordance and outcomes in participating institutions. We report here on clinical characteristics and CPG concordance among newly diagnosed (dx) pts with MCL in the database.             Methods: We prospectively collected demographic, staging, and treatment information on consecutive pts with MCL presenting at 5 geographically diverse NCCN institutions (Dana-Farber, Roswell Park, City of Hope, Fox Chase and MD Anderson). We assessed concordance with 2 CPG’s relevant to the concordance impacting the majority of pts: 1) bone marrow biopsy (BMBx) as part of the initial work-up and 2) use of an endorsed first line regimen among pts with stage III/IV disease. CPG concordance was assessed by comparing each pt’s care against the version on the NCCN guideline in effect at the time the pt was diagnosed.             Results: Between 7/2000 and 10/2005, we enrolled 132 MC evaluable pts. Median age was 58; 43\% had high-intermediate or high risk disease according to the IPI at presentation; 123 (93\%) pts presented with stage III/IV disease. The median follow-up was 22.6 months. Overall, 91\% of pts underwent a staging BMBx as recommended by the guidelines. Concordance varied by institution, low 78\% to high 98\%. Among 123 pts with stage III/IV disease, first-line therapy was concordant with CPG recommendations in only 59\%. Use of rituximab accounted for 92\% of all non-concordance. When the guidelines were modified in 2003 to include rituximab as an option for first-line therapy of MCL, concordance rose from 31\% (2000) to 100\% (2003–5). Of concordant pts receiving combination chemotherapy, 33\% received CHOP-based standard dose therapy and 62\% received dose-intense therapy. NCCN guidelines consider all therapy administered as part of a clinical trial to be concordant; trial-directed treatment accounted for 42\% of concordant care.             Conclusions: Our data suggest that the majority of MCL pts in these centers receive care that is concordant with current standards. In this subgroup of patients, participation in clinical trials occurred at an impressively high rate. However, not all pts undergo BMBx as a routine component of staging as recommended by NCCN guidelines suggesting that this is an area for potential quality improvement. This study also highlights that differences in management exist even within national comprehensive cancer centers. Because long-term follow-up is possible with this database, future studies will assess the initial treatment and guideline concordance on long-term outcomes in this unique group of pts.},

Recent advances in molecular biology enabled a better knowledge of the molecular heterogeneity within BRAF mutant (BRAFMT) CRCs, including high rate of overlapping with MSI-H status and detection of non-V600E mutations related to more favorable behavior. Treatment armamentarium has been rapidly growing in this subgroup and includes targeted combinations and immunotherapy for concomitant MSI-H patients, thereby making BRAFMT mCRC an innovative model for precision oncology. Nevertheless, duration of responses to targeted strategies remains unsatisfactory due to the development of secondary resistance, which is currently the field of major clinical research on BRAFMT mCRC. This review explores the molecular, clinical and therapeutic landscape of BRAFMT mCRC as well as an update on current treatment strategies and future perspectives in light of the heterogeneity of BRAF-mutated disease. Furthermore, a novel treatment algorithm for BRAFMT mCRC will be proposed.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 627 patients were randomly assigned to receive XELOX (n = 313) or FOLFOX-4 (n = 314) following disease progression/recurrence or intolerance to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: PFS for XELOX was noninferior to FOLFOX-4 [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.97; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-1.14] in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Median PFS was 4.7 months with XELOX versus 4.8 months with FOLFOX-4. The robustness of the primary analysis was supported by multivariate and subgroup analyses. Median overall survival in the ITT population was 11.9 months with XELOX versus 12.5 months with FOLFOX-4 (HR = 1.02; 95\% CI 0.86-1.21). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 50\% of XELOX- and 65\% of FOLFOX-4-treated patients. Whereas grade 3/4 neutropenia (35\% versus 5\% with XELOX) and febrile neutropenia (4\% versus {$<$} 1\%) were more common with FOLFOX-4, grade 3/4 diarrhea (19\% versus 5\% with FOLFOX-4) and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (4\% versus {$<$} 1\%) were more common with XELOX.

Metastatic colon cancer is often treated with a combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy), and/or regional therapy (hepatic artery infusion pumps). Utilizing the molecular and pathologic features of the primary tumor to tailor treatment for patients may improve overall survival. Rather than a “one size fits all” approach, a more nuanced treatment plan guided by the unique features of a patient’s tumor and the tumor’s microenvironment can more effectively treat the disease. Basic science work to elucidate new drug targets, understand mechanisms of evasion, and develop drugs and drug combinations is critical to inform clinical trials and identify novel, effective therapies for metastatic colorectal cancer. Through the lens of key targets for metastatic colorectal cancer, this review discusses how work in the basic science lab translates into clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a key player in the angiogenesis pathway. Despite benefits of bevacizumab in cancer therapy, it is clear that the VEGF pathway is complex, involving multiple isoforms, receptors, and alternative ligands such as VEGF-B, and placental growth factor, which could enable escape from VEGF-A-targeted angiogenesis inhibition. Recently developed therapies have targeted other ligands in the VEGF pathway (eg, aflibercept, known as ziv-aflibercept in the United States), VEGF receptors (eg, ramucirumab), and their tyrosine kinase signaling (ie, tyrosine kinase inhibitors). The goal of the current review was to identify comparative preclinical data for the currently available VEGF-targeted therapies. Sources were compiled using PubMed searches (2007 to 2012), using search terms including, but not limited to: “bevacizumab,” “aflibercept,” “ramucirumab,” and “IMC-18F1.” Two preclinical studies were identified that compared bevacizumab and the newer agent, aflibercept. These studies identified some important differences in binding and pharmacodynamic activity, although the potential clinical relevance of these findings is not known. Newer antiangiogenesis therapies should help further expand treatment options for colorectal and other cancers. Comparative preclinical data on these agents is currently lacking.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MCRC were randomly assigned, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, to XELOX versus FOLFOX-4, and then to bevacizumab versus placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 1,401 patients were randomly assigned in this 2 x 2 analysis. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.4 months in the bevacizumab group and 8.0 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 97.5\% CI, 0.72 to 0.95; P = .0023). Median overall survival was 21.3 months in the bevacizumab group and 19.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.89; 97.5\% CI, 0.76 to 1.03; P = .077). Response rates were similar in both arms. Analysis of treatment withdrawals showed that, despite protocol allowance of treatment continuation until disease progression, only 29\% and 47\% of bevacizumab and placebo recipients, respectively, were treated until progression. The toxicity profile of bevacizumab was consistent with that documented in previous trials. CONCLUSION: The addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved PFS in this first-line trial in patients with MCRC. Overall survival differences did not reach statistical significance, and response rate was not improved by the addition of bevacizumab. Treatment continuation until disease progression may be necessary in order to optimize the contribution of bevacizumab to therapy.},

  abstract = {Breast cancers are complex ecosystems of malignant cells and the tumour microenvironment1. The composition of these tumour ecosystems and interactions within them contribute to responses to~cytotoxic therapy2. Efforts to build response predictors have not incorporated this knowledge. We collected clinical, digital pathology, genomic and transcriptomic profiles of pre-treatment biopsies of breast tumours from 168 patients treated with chemotherapy with or without HER2 (encoded by ERBB2)-targeted therapy before surgery. Pathology end points (complete response or residual disease) at surgery3 were then correlated with multi-omic features in these diagnostic biopsies. Here we show that response to treatment is modulated by the pre-treated tumour ecosystem, and its multi-omics landscape can be integrated in predictive models using machine learning. The degree of residual disease following therapy is monotonically associated with pre-therapy features, including tumour mutational and copy number landscapes, tumour proliferation, immune infiltration and T cell dysfunction and exclusion. Combining these features into a multi-omic machine learning model predicted a~pathological complete response in an external validation cohort (75 patients) with an area under the curve of 0.87. In conclusion, response to therapy is determined by the baseline characteristics of the totality of the tumour ecosystem captured through data integration and machine learning. This approach could be used to develop predictors for other cancers.},

This prospective phase 2 trial of daratumumab monotherapy for the treatment of AL amyloidosis was designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and hematologic and clinical response. Daratumumab 16 mg/kg was administered by IV infusion once weekly for weeks 1 to 8, every 2 weeks for weeks 9 to 24, and every 4 weeks thereafter until progression or unacceptable toxicity, for up to 24 months. Twenty-two patients with previously treated AL amyloidosis were enrolled. The majority of the patients had received high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplantation and/or treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. The median time between prior therapy and trial enrollment was 9 months (range, 1-180 months). No grade 3-4 infusion-related reactions occurred. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events included respiratory infections (n = 4; 18\%) and atrial fibrillation (n = 4, 18\%). Hematologic complete and very-good-partial response occurred in 86\% of patients. The median time to first and best hematologic response was 4 weeks and 3 months, respectively. Renal response occurred in 10 of 15 patients (67\%) with renal involvement and cardiac response occurred in 7 of 14 patients (50\%) with cardiac involvement. In summary, daratumumab is well tolerated in patients with relapsed AL amyloidosis and leads to rapid and deep hematologic responses and organ responses.

The FISH assay can be technically challenging and difficult to interpret. ALK immunohistochemistry and next generation sequencing have been proposed as alternative approaches. In this study, we compared various ALK �焅ISH patterns to next �孄eneration sequencing (NGS) for gene fusion detection, ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tumor responses to crizotinib. 72 (4\%) of 2116 lung adenocarcinoma were positive by ALK- FISH. Of 28 ALK -FISH positive cases selected for the study, FISH patterns included 15 (54\%) cases with split signal, 10 (36\%) with single orange signal and 3 (10\%) with �騦ixed pattern��. 12 (80\%) cases with split signal and 4 (40\%) cases with single orange signal were positive by NGS and IHC, while mixed cases were all negative. Mutation analysis of discordant cases revealed multiple mutations including oncogenic mutations in EGFR , KRAS , BRAF and ATM genes. All discordant cases in groups with split and mixed signal showed a lower number of cells with rearrangement (mean 28.5\%; range 20.5-36.9\%). No statistically significant association between response to crizotinib and FISH patterns was observed (p=0.73). In contrast, NGS fusion positive cases were associated with more responses to crizotinib than NGS negative cases (p= 0.016). Our study suggests that ALK FISH alone may not be the most reliable assay for detection of ALK gene rearrangements, and probably should be used in parallel with ALK IHC and NGS for detection of gene fusions and mutations.}

  abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations (ex20ins) account for ≤ 12\% of all EGFR-mutant nonsmall cell lung cancers. We analysed real-world datasets to determine the frequency of ex20ins variants, and the ability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify them. Three real-world United States NGS databases were used: GENIE, FoundationInsights, and GuardantINFORM. Mutation profiles consistent with in-frame EGFR ex20ins were summarized. GENIE, FoundationInsights, and GuardantINFORM datasets identified 180, 627, and 627 patients with EGFR ex20ins respectively. The most frequent insertion region of exon 20 was the near loop (\textasciitilde{} 70\%), followed by the far loop (\textasciitilde{} 30\%) and the helical (\textasciitilde{} 3-6\%) regions. GENIE, FoundationInsights, and GuardantINFORM datasets identified 41, 102, and 96 unique variants respectively. An analysis of variants projected that \textasciitilde{} 50\% of EGFR ex20ins identified by NGS would have been missed by PCR-based assays. Given the breadth of EGFR ex20ins identified in the real-world US datasets, the ability of PCR to identify these mutations is limited. NGS platforms are more appropriate to identify patients likely to benefit from EGFR ex20ins-targeted therapies.}

  abstract = {AXL is a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor that signals via PI3K, MAPK, and protein kinase C (PKC), among other pathways. AXL has oncogenic potential and interacts with other membrane receptors, depending on their relative abundance and availability. The increased expression of AXL in cancer is often the result of pharmacologic selective pressure to a number of chemotherapies and targeted therapies and acts as a mechanism of acquired drug resistance. This resistance phenotype, frequently accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, can be reversed by AXL inhibition. In tumors with high levels of EGFR, including lung, head and neck, and triple-negative breast cancer, AXL dimerizes with this receptor and initiates signaling that circumvents the antitumor effects of anti-EGFR therapies. Likewise, AXL overexpression and dimerization with EGFR can overcome PI3K inhibition by activating the phospholipase C-帠-PKC cascade that, in turn, sustains mTORC1 activity. The causative role of AXL in inducing drug resistance is underscored by the fact that the suppression of AXL restores sensitivity to these agents. Hence, these observations indicate that AXL is selectively expressed in tumor cells refractory to therapy and that cotargeting AXL in this setting would potentially overcome drug resistance. The use of AXL inhibitors should be considered in the clinic. Clin Cancer Res; 22(6); 1313��7. 穢2016 AACR .}

However, the clinical and molecular features of HER2-low BC are yet to be elucidated. Here, we collected retrospective clinicopathological and PAM50 data from 3,689 patients with HER2-negative disease and made the following observations. First, the proportion of HER2-low was higher in HR-positive disease (65.4\%) than triple-negative BC (TNBC, 36.6\%). Second, within HR-positive disease,               ERBB2               and luminal-related genes were more expressed in HER2-low than HER2 0. In contrast, no gene was found differentially expressed in TNBC according to HER2 expression. Third, within HER2-low,               ERBB2               levels were higher in HR-positive disease than TNBC. Fourth, HER2-low was not associated with overall survival in HR-positive disease and TNBC. Finally, the reproducibility of HER2-low among pathologists was suboptimal. This study emphasizes the large biological heterogeneity of HER2-low BC, and the need to implement reproducible and sensitive assays to measure low HER2 expression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To increase awareness, outline strategies, and offer guidance on the recommended management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy. METHODS A multidisciplinary panel of medical oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, pulmonology, endocrinology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialists, and advocacy experts was convened to update the guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on evidence published from 2017 through 2021. RESULTS A total of 175 studies met the eligibility criteria of the systematic review and were pertinent to the development of the recommendations. Because of the paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are based on expert consensus. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations for specific organ system–based toxicity diagnosis and management are presented. While management varies according to the organ system affected, in general, ICPi therapy should be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxicities, except for some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. ICPi therapy may be suspended for most grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert ≤ grade 1. Corticosteroids may be administered. Grade 3 toxicities generally warrant suspension of ICPis and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4-6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require other immunosuppressive therapy. In general, permanent discontinuation of ICPis is recommended with grade 4 toxicities, except for endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Background Concurrent programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-(L)1) plus osimertinib is associated with severe immune related adverse events (irAE) in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Now that PD-(L)1 inhibitors are routinely used as adjuvant and first-line treatments, sequential PD-(L)1 inhibition followed by osimertinib use may become more frequent and have unforeseen serious toxicity. Methods We identified patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were treated with PD-(L)1 blockade and EGFR- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), irrespective of drug or sequence of administration (total n=126). Patient records were reviewed to identify severe (NCI-CTCAE v5.0 grades 3��4) toxicity. Results Fifteen percent [6 of 41, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 7\% to 29\%] of all patients treated with sequential PD-(L)1 blockade followed later by osimertinib developed a severe irAE. Severe irAEs were most common among those who began osimertinib within 3months of prior PD-(L)1 blockade (5 of 21, 24\%, 95\% CI 10\% to 45\%), as compared with {$>$}3��12months (1 of 8, 13\%, 95\% CI 0\% to 50\%), {$>$}12months (0 of 12, 0\%, 95\% CI 0\% to 28\%). By contrast, no severe irAEs were identified among patients treated with osimertinib followed by PD-(L)1 (0 of 29, 95\% CI 0\% to 14\%) or PD-(L)1 followed by other EGFR-TKIs (afatinib or erlotinib, 0 of 27, 95\% CI 0\% to 15\%). IrAEs occurred at a median onset of 20days after osimertinib (range 14��167days). All patients with irAEs required steroids and most required hospitalization. Conclusion PD-(L)1 blockade followed by osimertinib is associated with severe irAE and is most frequent among patients who recently received PD-(L)1 blockade. No irAEs were observed when osimertinib preceded PD-(L)1 blockade or when PD-(L)1 was followed by other EGFR-TKIs. This association appears to be specific to osimertinib, as no severe irAEs occurred with administration of other EGFR-TKIs.}

  abstract = {Purpose: Patterns of resistance to first-line osimertinib are not well-established and have primarily been evaluated using plasma assays, which cannot detect histologic transformation and have differential sensitivity for copy number changes and chromosomal rearrangements. Experimental Design: To characterize mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib, patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers who received osimertinib at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and had next-generation sequencing performed on tumor tissue before osimertinib initiation and after progression were identified. Results: Among 62 patients who met eligibility criteria, histologic transformation, primarily squamous transformation, was identified in 15\% of first-line osimertinib cases and 14\% of later-line cases. Nineteen percent (5/27) of patients treated with first-line osimertinib had off-target genetic resistance (2 MET amplification, 1 KRAS mutation, 1 RET fusion, and 1 BRAF fusion) whereas 4\% (1/27) had an acquired EGFR mutation (EGFR G724S). Patients with squamous transformation exhibited considerable genomic complexity; acquired PIK3CA mutation, chromosome 3q amplification, and FGF amplification were all seen. Patients with transformation had shorter time on osimertinib and shorter survival compared with patients with on-target resistance. Initial EGFR sensitizing mutation, time on osimertinib treatment, and line of therapy also influenced resistance mechanism that emerged. The compound mutation EGFR S768 + V769L and the mutation MET H1094Y were identified and validated as resistance mechanisms with potential treatment options. Conclusions: Histologic transformation and other off-target molecular alterations are frequent early emerging resistance mechanisms to osimertinib and are associated with poor clinical outcomes.

Methods EGFR+ (del 19, L858R, G719X, S768I, L851Q) NSCLC clinical samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor and blood) were analyzed for the presence of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and BRAF fusions. Treatment history and response were obtained from provided pathology reports and treating clinicians. Results Clinical samples from 3505 unique EGFR+ NSCLCs were identified from June 2012 to October 2017. A total of 31 EGFR+ cases had concurrent kinase fusions detected: 10 (32\%) BRAF, 7 (23\%) ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), 6 (19\%) ret proto-oncogene (RET), 6 (19\%) fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), 1 (3.2\%) EGFR, and 1 (3.2\%) neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1), including two novel fusions (SALL2-BRAF and PLEKHA7-ALK). Twenty-seven of 31 patients had either a known history of EGFR+ NSCLC diagnosis or prior treatment with an EGFR TKI before the fusion+ sample was collected. Twelve of the 27 patients had paired pre-treatment samples where the fusion was not present before treatment with an EGFR TKI. Multiple patients treated with combination therapy targeting EGFR and the acquired fusion had clinical benefit, including one patient with osimertinib resistance due to an acquired PLEKHA7-ALK fusion achieving a durable partial response with combination of full-dose osimertinib and alectinib. Conclusions RTK and BRAF fusions are rare but potentially druggable resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs. Detection of RTK and BRAF fusions should be part of comprehensive profiling panels to determine resistance to EGFR TKIs and direct appropriate combination therapeutic strategies.}

  abstract = {Lung cancers harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but drug resistance invariably emerges. To elucidate mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we performed systematic genetic and histological analyses of tumor biopsies from 37 patients with drug-resistant non�𦽳mall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) carrying EGFR mutations. All drug-resistant tumors retained their original activating EGFR mutations, and some acquired known mechanisms of resistance including the EGFR T790M mutation or MET gene amplification. Some resistant cancers showed unexpected genetic changes including EGFR amplification and mutations in the PIK3CA gene, whereas others underwent a pronounced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Surprisingly, five resistant tumors (14\%) transformed from NSCLC into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and were sensitive to standard SCLC treatments. In three patients, serial biopsies revealed that genetic mechanisms of resistance were lost in the absence of the continued selective pressure of EGFR inhibitor treatment, and such cancers were sensitive to a second round of treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of resistance to EGFR inhibitors and underscore the importance of repeatedly assessing cancers throughout the course of the disease.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the non-curative setting, the sequence in which anticancer agents are used, singly or in combination, may be important if patients are to receive the maximum period of disease control with the minimum of adverse effects. We compared sequential and combination chemotherapy strategies in patients with unpretreated advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, who were regarded as not potentially curable irrespective of response. METHODS: We studied patients with advanced colorectal cancer, starting treatment with non-curative intent. 2135 unpretreated patients were randomly assigned to three treatment strategies in the ratio 1:1:1. Strategy A (control group) was single-agent fluorouracil (given with levofolinate over 48 h every 2 weeks) until failure, then single-agent irinotecan. Strategy B was fluorouracil until failure, then combination chemotherapy. Strategy C was combination chemotherapy from the outset. Within strategies B and C, patients were randomly assigned to receive, as the combination regimen, fluorouracil plus irinotecan (groups B-ir and C-ir) or fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (groups B-ox and C-ox). The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 79877428. RESULTS: Median survival of patients allocated to control strategy A was 13.9 months. Median survival of each of the other groups was longer (B-ir 15.0, B-ox 15.2, C-ir 16.7, and C-ox 15.4 months). However, log-rank comparison of each group against control showed that only C-ir--the first-line combination strategy including irinotecan--satisfied the statistical test for superiority (p=0.01). Overall comparison of strategy B with strategy C was within the predetermined non-inferiority boundary of HR=1.18 or less (HR=1.06, 90\% CI 0.97-1.17). INTERPRETATION: Our data challenge the assumption that, in this non-curative setting, maximum tolerable treatment must necessarily be used first-line. The staged approach of initial single-agent treatment upgraded to combination when required is not worse than first-line combination, and is an alternative option for discussion with patients.},

Phase I and II studies of crizotinib in ALK-positive lung cancer demonstrated impressive activity and clinical benefit, leading to rapid US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2011. Although crizotinib induces remissions and extends the lives of patients, cures are not achieved as resistance to therapy develops.

Whether crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy with respect to efficacy is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, open-label trial comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy in 347 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive lung cancer who had received one prior platinum-based regimen. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment with crizotinib (250 mg) twice daily or intravenous chemotherapy with either pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or docetaxel (75 mg per square meter) every 3 weeks. Patients in the chemotherapy group who had disease progression were permitted to cross over to crizotinib as part of a separate study. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 7.7 months in the crizotinib group and 3.0 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.64; P{$<$}0.001). The response rates were 65\% (95\% CI, 58 to 72) with crizotinib, as compared with 20\% (95\% CI, 14 to 26) with chemotherapy (P{$<$}0.001). An interim analysis of overall survival showed no significant improvement with crizotinib as compared with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for death in the crizotinib group, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.68 to 1.54; P=0.54). Common adverse events associated with crizotinib were visual disorder, gastrointestinal side effects, and elevated liver aminotransferase levels, whereas common adverse events with chemotherapy were fatigue, alopecia, and dyspnea. Patients reported greater reductions in symptoms of lung cancer and greater improvement in global quality of life with crizotinib than with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in patients with previously treated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement.

This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond to lorlatinib (PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance to lorlatinib through steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib. The patient received crizotinib again, and her cancer-related symptoms and liver failure resolved. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01970865.).}

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of alectinib in patients with ALK -positive NSCLC who progressed on previous crizotinib. Methods We did a phase 2 study at 27 centres in the USA and Canada. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with stage IIIB�𨧻V, ALK -positive NSCLC who had progressed after crizotinib. Patients were treated with oral alectinib 600 mg twice daily until progression, death, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response by an independent review committee using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Response endpoints were assessed in the response-evaluable population (ie, patients with measurable disease at baseline who received at least one dose of study drug), and efficacy and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population (all enrolled patients). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01871805. The study is ongoing and patients are still receiving treatment. Findings Between Sept 4, 2013, and Aug 4, 2014, 87 patients were enrolled into the study (intention-to-treat population). At the time of the primary analysis (median follow-up 4繚8 months [IQR 3繚3��7繚1]), 33 of 69 patients with measurable disease at baseline had a confirmed partial response; thus, the proportion of patients achieving an objective response by the independent review committee was 48\% (95\% CI 36��60). Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2, most commonly constipation (31 [36\%]), fatigue (29 [33\%]), myalgia 21 [24\%]), and peripheral oedema 20 [23\%]). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were changes in laboratory values, including increased blood creatine phosphokinase (seven [8\%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (five [6\%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (four [5\%]). Two patients died: one had a haemorrhage (judged related to study treatment), and one had disease progression and a history of stroke (judged unrelated to treatment). Interpretation Alectinib showed clinical activity and was well tolerated in patients with ALK -positive NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib. Therefore, alectinib could be a suitable treatment for patients with ALK -positive disease who have progressed on crizotinib. Funding F Hoffmann-La Roche.}

  abstract = {Summary Background Most patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK )-rearranged or ROS proto-oncogene 1 ( ROS1 )-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, but resistance invariably develops, commonly within the CNS. This study aimed to analyse the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of lorlatinib, a novel, highly potent, selective, and brain-penetrant ALK and ROS1 TKI with preclinical activity against most known resistance mutations, in patients with advanced ALK -positive or ROS1 -positive NSCLC. Methods In this international multicentre, open-label, single-arm, first-in-man phase 1 dose-escalation study, eligible patients had advanced ALK -positive or ROS1 -positive NSCLC and were older than 18 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate end-organ function. Lorlatinib was administered orally to patients at doses ranging from 10 mg to 200 mg once daily or 35 mg to 100 mg twice daily, with a minimum of three patients receiving each dose. For some patients, tumour biopsy was done before lorlatinib treatment to identify ALK resistance mutations. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of lorlatinib; efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population (patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had either ALK or ROS1 rearrangement). The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities during cycle 1 according to investigator assessment; secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, and overall response. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01970865. Findings Between Jan 22, 2014, and July 10, 2015, 54 patients received at least one dose of lorlatinib, including 41 (77\%) with ALK -positive and 12 (23\%) with ROS1 -positive NSCLC; one patient had unconfirmed ALK and ROS1 status. 28 (52\%) patients had received two or more TKIs, and 39 (72\%) patients had CNS metastases. The most common treatment-related adverse events among the 54 patients were hypercholesterolaemia (39 [72\%] of 54 patients), hypertriglyceridaemia (21 [39\%] of 54 patients), peripheral neuropathy (21 [39\%] of 54 patients), and peripheral oedema (21 [39\%] of 54 patients). One dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 200 mg (the patient did not take at least 16 of 21 prescribed total daily doses in cycle 1 because of toxicities attributable to study drug, which were grade 2 neurocognitive adverse events comprising slowed speech and mentation and word-finding difficulty). No maximum tolerated dose was identified. The recommended phase 2 dose was selected as 100 mg once daily. For ALK -positive patients, the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 19 (46\%) of 41 patients (95\% CI 31��63); for those who had received two or more TKIs, the proportion of patients with an objective response was 11 (42\%) of 26 patients (23��63). In ROS1 -positive patients, including seven crizotinib-pretreated patients, an objective response was achieved by six (50\%) of 12 patients (95\% CI 21��79). Interpretation In this phase 1, dose-escalation study, lorlatinib showed both systemic and intracranial activity in patients with advanced ALK -positive or ROS1 -positive NSCLC, most of whom had CNS metastases and had previously had two or more TKI treatments fail. Therefore, lorlatinib might be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with ALK -positive NSCLC who have become resistant to currently available TKIs, including second-generation ALK TKIs, and is being investigated in a phase 3 randomised controlled trial comparing lorlatinib to crizotinib (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03052608).

  abstract = {PURPOSE CALGB 40603 (NCT00861705), a 2 × 2 randomized phase II trial, demonstrated that adding carboplatin or bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel (wP) followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide significantly increased the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer. We now report long-term outcomes (LTOs) and correlative science end points. PATIENTS AND METHODS The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate LTOs in 443 patients who initiated study treatment. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the impact of clinical characteristics, pathologic response, calculated residual cancer burden (RCB) in patients with residual disease (RD), treatment assignment, and dose delivery during wP on LTOs, including event-free survival (EFS). Genomic predictors of treatment response and outcomes were assessed on pretreatment tumor samples by mRNA sequencing. RESULTS Among baseline characteristics, only the clinical stage was associated with LTOs. At a median follow-up of 7.9 years, LTOs were not significantly improved with either carboplatin or bevacizumab, overall or in patients with basal-like subtype cancers by genomic analysis. Patients with pCR (n = 205, 46.3\%) had significantly higher 5-year EFS (85.5\% v 56.6\%, log-rank P {$<$} .0001) and overall survival (87.9\% v 63.4\%, P {$<$} .0001) rates compared with patients with RD, even those with RCB class I. Among clinical and genomic features, evidence of immune activation, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and low B-cell receptor evenness, was associated with pCR and improved EFS. CONCLUSION Despite higher pCR rates, neither carboplatin nor bevacizumab appeared to improve LTOs although the study was not powered to assess these secondary end points. pCR was associated with superior LTOs even when compared with minimal RD. Markers of immune activation in pretreatment tumor biopsies were independently associated with higher pCR rates and improved survival.},

However, tumors invariably acquire resistance to lorlatinib, and after sequential ALK TKIs culminating with lorlatinib, diverse refractory compound ALK mutations can emerge.

METHODS: ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of the literature on adjuvant therapy for resected biliary tract cancer and provide recommended care options for this patient population. RESULTS: Three phase III randomized controlled trials, one phase II trial, and 16 retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria. RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on evidence from a phase III randomized controlled trial, patients with resected biliary tract cancer should be offered adjuvant capecitabine chemotherapy for a duration of 6 months. The dosing used in this trial is described in the qualifying statements, while it should be noted that the dose of capecitabine may also be determined by institutional and regional practices. Patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer and a microscopically positive surgical resection margin (R1 resection) may be offered chemoradiation therapy. A shared decision-making approach is recommended, considering the risk of harm and potential for benefit associated with radiation therapy for patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer.

  abstract = {Tumors are cellularly and molecularly heterogeneous, with subsets of undifferentiated cancer cells exhibiting stem cell-like features (CSCs). Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) are transdifferentiation programs that are required for tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. The EMT process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-帣, whose activities are dysregulated during malignant tumor progression. Thus, EMT induction in cancer cells results in the acquisition of invasive and metastatic properties. Recent reports indicate that the emergence of CSCs occurs in part as a result of EMT, for example, through cues from tumor stromal components. Recent evidence now indicates that EMT of tumor cells not only causes increased metastasis, but also contributes to drug resistance. In this review, we will provide potential mechanistic explanations for the association between EMT induction and the emergence of CSCs. We will also highlight recent studies implicating the function of TGF-帣-regulated noncoding RNAs in driving EMT and promoting CSC self-renewal. Finally we will discuss how EMT and CSCs may contribute to drug resistance, as well as therapeutic strategies to overcome this clinically.}

PURPOSE               To provide evidence-based recommendations updating the 2020 ASCO and Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) guideline on systemic therapy for patients with stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer without driver alterations.                                         METHODS               ASCO updated recommendations on the basis of an ongoing systematic review of randomized clinical trials from 2018 to 2021.                                         RESULTS               This guideline update reflects changes in evidence since the previous update. Five randomized clinical trials provide the evidence base.

RECOMMENDATIONS               In addition to 2020 options for patients with high programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥ 50\%), nonsquamous cell carcinoma (non-SCC), and performance status (PS) 0-1, clinicians may offer single-agent atezolizumab. With high PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50\%), non-SCC, and PS 0-1, clinicians may offer nivolumab and ipilumumab alone or nivolumab and ipilimumab plus chemotherapy. With negative (0\%) and low positive PD-L1 expression (TPS 1\%-49\%), non-SCC, and PS 0-1, clinicians may offer nivolumab and ipilimumab alone or nivolumab and ipilimumab plus chemotherapy. With high PD-L1 expression, SCC, and PS 0-1, clinicians may offer single-agent atezolizumab. With high PD-L1 expression, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and PS 0-1, clinicians may offer nivolumab and ipilimumab alone or in combination with two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. With negative and low positive PD-L1 expression, SCC, and PS 0-1, clinicians may offer nivolumab and ipilimumab alone or in combination with two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. With non-SCC who received an immune checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy as first-line therapy, clinicians may offer second-line paclitaxel plus bevacizumab. With non-SCC, who received chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, clinicians should offer the options of third-line single-agent pemetrexed, docetaxel, or paclitaxel plus bevacizumab.

  abstract = {View some of our alignments in IGV Let’s take a look at some of the aligments we just produced using IGV. Since we have configured our AWS instances to serve all of the files produced by the exercises we can load our BAM files by URL. Since the BAM files are indexed, only the information we request to view will be transferred from the AWS instance to our browser for viewing. To load the exome BAMs your URLs should look like these (don’t forget to substitute your number for \#): http://s\#.pmbio.org/align/Exome\_Norm\_sorted\_mrkdup\_bqsr.bam http://s\#.pmbio.org/align/Exome\_Tumor\_sorted\_mrkdup\_bqsr.bam Let’s go through some simple exercises for exploring the Exome BAMs in IGV. Load the exome BAMs If IGV is already running, start a new session with File -{$>$} New Session Load the bam files (using the URLs above) with File -{$>$} Load from URL Rename the tracks (e.g., Exome Norm Coverage, Exome Norm BAM, Exome Tumor Coverage, Exome Tumor BAM) by right-clicking on each track and selecting Rename Track Save session with File -{$>$} Save Session View exome alignments for an example gene For example, let’s take a look at TP53 on chr17. Simply type TP53 into the search box and hit Go or enter. Notice the coverage peaks roughly centered around each protein-coding exon. Notice that there are several variants. EXERCISE Explore the TP53 sequence and answer the following questions. How many potential variants can you find? Are they SNVs or indels? Are they coding or non-coding? Are the homozygous or heterozygous? Are they germline or somatic? How can you tell? Hint Expand the Gene track to see where TP53 starts. In the collapsed view it appears to be contiguous with WRAP53 due to overlapping transcripts. Hint Zoom into the \textasciitilde 7-8kb region with coding exons (thicker than UTR). Look for colored bars in the coverage track for SNVs and stacks of black gaps (deletions) or purple bars (insertions). Answer There appear to be at least 5 SNVs, 1 insertion and 3 deletions. Two of the SNVs are in coding exons while the rest of the variants are intronic. Note: The 4 indels all look like potential artifacts due to their proximity to homopolymer stretches or repetitive sequences. All of the SNVs appear real and homozygous (or hemizygous). One SNV appears to be somatic. In all cases the VAFs of the SNVs are at or near 100\% and one of them is only observed in the tumor. This is one the variants you should have found in TP53. Which one? Now, try viewing the reads as read pairs. How big do your fragments look? Answer The fragment sizes vary. But, estimating by eye, and clicking on a few read pairs to get the insert size, it appears that fragments are in the 200-500bp range Here is a representative region showing reads in paired mode. Considering TP53, what does the average coverage look like? Hint The exons of TP53 have coverage peaks ranging from \textasciitilde 100 to 200X. On average there appears to be \textasciitilde 150X coverage for coding exons. Try loading the .bed file for the exome reagent. Browse your instance for the NimbleGen SeqCap\_EZ\_Exome\_v3 bed file that we downloaded in the Annotation Module. As before, use the File -{$>$} Load from URL... option. The URL should look something like (don’t forget to substitute your number for \#): http://s\#.pmbio.org/inputs/references/exome/SeqCap\_EZ\_Exome\_v3\_hg38\_primary\_targets.v2.bed How does the coverage pattern compare to the coordinates of targeted regions? Answer As expected, the targeted regions closely overlap the coding exons. Load the WGS BAMs Lets start a new session and load the WGS BAMs, your URLs should look like these: http://s\#.pmbio.org/align/WGS\_Norm\_merged\_sorted\_mrkdup\_bqsr.bam http://s\#.pmbio.org/align/WGS\_Tumor\_merged\_sorted\_mrkdup\_bqsr.bam Using the URLs above: If IGV is already running, start a new session with File -{$>$} New Session Load the bam files (using the URLs above) with File -{$>$} Load from URL Rename the tracks (e.g., WGS Norm Coverage, WGS Norm BAM, WGS Tumor Coverage, WGS Tumor BAM) by right-clicking on each track and selecting Rename Track Save session with File -{$>$} Save Session View WGS alignments for an example gene Once again, let’s take a look at TP53 on chr17. Simply type TP53 into the search box and hit Go or enter. What does the average WGS coverage look like for Normal and Tumor? How does it differ from the exome coverage pattern? What about the fragment sizes? Answer The WGS Normal sample appears to have average coverage of \textasciitilde 50X whereas the normal has average coverage of \textasciitilde 75X. In general the fragment sizes seem a little larger, with a wider range, from \textasciitilde 250bp to \textasciitilde 600 Color alignments by library or read group by right-clicking on each alignment data track and selecting Color alignments by -{$>$} library or Color alignments by -{$>$} read group. How many read groups and libraries are there? Answer There were three libraries sequenced across 5 lanes. Lane has been used as read group in this case Explore on your own Spend some time scrolling around and zooming in and out to get a feel for the WGS data. Can you find any regions of low coverage? What are they correlated with? What is different between the variant allele fractions of the normal and tumor? What could explain this? What else of interest can you find?},

  abstract = {Small molecule inhibitors targeting mutant EGFR are standard of care in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but acquired resistance invariably develops through mutations in EGFR or through activation of compensatory pathways such as cMet. Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372) is an anti-EGFR and anti-cMet bispecific low fucose antibody with enhanced Fc function designed to treat tumors driven by activated EGFR and/or cMet signaling. Potent in vivo antitumor efficacy is observed upon amivantamab treatment of human tumor xenograft models driven by mutant activated EGFR, and this activity is associated with receptor downregulation. Despite these robust antitumor responses in vivo, limited antiproliferative effects and EGFR/cMet receptor downregulation by amivantamab were observed in vitro Interestingly, in vitro addition of isolated human immune cells notably enhanced amivantamab-mediated EGFR and cMet downregulation, leading to antibody dose-dependent cancer cell killing. Through a comprehensive assessment of the Fc-mediated effector functions, we demonstrate that monocytes and/or macrophages, through trogocytosis, are necessary and sufficient for Fc interaction-mediated EGFR/cMet downmodulation and are required for in vivo antitumor efficacy. Collectively, our findings represent a novel Fc-dependent macrophage-mediated antitumor mechanism of amivantamab and highlight trogocytosis as an important mechanism of action to exploit in designing new antibody-based cancer therapies.}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter, open-label, phase III study randomly assigned 1,298 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing mCRC who had experienced first-line fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin treatment failure to cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) day 1 followed by 250 mg/m(2) weekly) plus irinotecan (350 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks) or irinotecan alone. Primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: Median OS was comparable between treatments: 10.7 months (95\% CI, 9.6 to 11.3) with cetuximab/irinotecan and 10.0 months (95\% CI, 9.1 to 11.3) with irinotecan alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.975; 95\% CI, 0.854 to 1.114; P = .71). This lack of difference may have been due to post-trial therapy: 46.9\% of patients assigned to irinotecan eventually received cetuximab (87.2\% of those who did, received it with irinotecan). Cetuximab added to irinotecan significantly improved PFS (median, 4.0 v 2.6 months; HR, 0.692; 95\% CI, 0.617 to 0.776; P},

This open-label, phase 3 study evaluated atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic nonsquamous non�𦽳mall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not previously received chemotherapy. Methods We randomly assigned patients to receive atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ACP), bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (BCP), or atezolizumab plus BCP (ABCP) every 3 weeks for four or six cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with atezolizumab, bevacizumab, or both. The two primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival both among patients in the intention-to-treat population who had a wild-type genotype (WT population; patients with EGFR or ALK genetic alterations were excluded) and among patients in the WT population who had high expression of an effector T-cell (Teff) gene signature in the tumor (Teff-high WT population) and overall survival in the WT population. The ABCP group was compared with the BCP group before the ACP group was compared with the BCP group. Results In the WT population, 356 patients were assigned to the ABCP group, and 336 to the BCP group. The median progression-free survival was longer in the ABCP group than in the BCP group (8.3 months vs. 6.8 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.74; P{$<$}0.001); the corresponding values in the Teff-high WT population were 11.3 months and 6.8 months (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95\% CI, 0.38 to 0.68]; P{$<$}0.001). Progression-free survival was also longer in the ABCP group than in the BCP group in the entire intention-to-treat population (including those with EGFR or ALK genetic alterations) and among patients with low or negative programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, those with low Teff gene-signature expression, and those with liver metastases. Median overall survival among the patients in the WT population was longer in the ABCP group than in the BCP group (19.2 months vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.64 to 0.96; P=0.02). The safety profile of ABCP was consistent with previously reported safety risks of the individual medicines. Conclusions The addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival among patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression and EGFR or ALK genetic alteration status.

Single-arm studies demonstrating rapid and durable responses in the majority of ALK-positive NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib have been followed by a randomized phase III clinical trial in which superiority of crizotinib over chemotherapy was seen in previously treated ALK-positive NSCLC patients.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy of the ALK inhibitor crizotinib as compared with standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 3 trial comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy in 343 patients with advanced ALK-positive nonsquamous NSCLC who had received no previous systemic treatment for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral crizotinib at a dose of 250 mg twice daily or to receive intravenous chemotherapy (pemetrexed, 500 mg per square meter of body-surface area, plus either cisplatin, 75 mg per square meter, or carboplatin, target area under the curve of 5 to 6 mg per milliliter per minute) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. Crossover to crizotinib treatment after disease progression was permitted for patients receiving chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by independent radiologic review. RESULTS: Progression-free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib than with chemotherapy (median, 10.9 months vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.60; P{$<$}0.001). Objective response rates were 74\% and 45\%, respectively (P{$<$}0.001). Median overall survival was not reached in either group (hazard ratio for death with crizotinib, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.54 to 1.26; P=0.36); the probability of 1-year survival was 84\% with crizotinib and 79\% with chemotherapy. The most common adverse events with crizotinib were vision disorders, diarrhea, nausea, and edema, and the most common events with chemotherapy were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and decreased appetite. As compared with chemotherapy, crizotinib was associated with greater reduction in lung cancer symptoms and greater improvement in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib was superior to standard first-line pemetrexed-plus-platinum chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction Gene fusion variants in ALK-rearranged NSCLC may predict patient outcomes, but previous results have been inconclusive. Fusion isoforms coexisting in the same tumor may affect the efficacy of targeted therapy, but they have not been investigated. Methods Patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who received crizotinib treatments were recruited. Precrizotinib tumor tissues were analyzed by the anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction for targeted RNA sequencing. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used to compare overall and progression-free survivals. Results Of the 51 studied subjects, EML4-ALK variant types v1, v2, v3, and others were detected in 23 (45.1\%), five (9.8\%), 19 (37.3\%), and four patients (7.8\%), respectively. Multiple EML4-ALK RNA isoforms were detected in 24 tumors (47.1\%), and single isoform in 27 (52.9\%). Most of the v3 tumors (16 of 19) harbored both v3a and v3b RNA isoforms. Multiple isoforms were also detected in eight non-v3 tumors (33.3\% of all 24 multiple isoforms; five v1, two v5��, and one v2). Compared with patients with single isoform, those with multiple isoforms had worse progression-free (hazard ratio and 95\% confidence interval: 2.45 [1.06��5.69]) and overall (hazard ratio [95\% confidence interval]: 3.74 [1.26��11.13]) survivals after adjusting for potential confounders including variant type. Using the patient-derived H2228 cells known to express v3a and v3b, our single-cell polymerase chain reaction detected either v3a or v3b in most single cells. Treatment of H2228 cells by three ALK inhibitors revealed increased ratios of v3a-to-v3b expression over time. Conclusions Intratumoral EML4-ALK isoforms may predict the efficacy of targeted therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Temporal changes of intratumoral fusion isoforms may result from differential selection pressures that a drug might have on one isoform over another. Larger studies on fusion heterogeneity using RNA sequencing are warranted.}

We report that these mutant EGFRs selectively activate Akt and signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways, which promote cell survival, but have no effect on extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, which induces proliferation. NSCLC cells expressing mutant EGFRs underwent extensive apoptosis after small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the mutant EGFR or treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of Akt and STAT signaling and were relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus, mutant EGFRs selectively transduce survival signals on which NSCLCs become dependent; inhibition of those signals by gefitinib may contribute to the drug's efficacy.}

Genomics England, alongside NHS England, analyzed WGS data from 13,880 solid tumors spanning 33 cancer types, integrating genomic data with real-world treatment and outcome data, within a secure Research Environment. Incidence of somatic mutations in genes recommended for standard-of-care testing varied across cancer types. For instance, in glioblastoma multiforme, small variants were present in 94\% of cases and copy number aberrations in at least one gene in 58\% of cases, while sarcoma demonstrated the highest occurrence of actionable structural variants (13\%). Homologous recombination deficiency was identified in 40\% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases with 30\% linked to pathogenic germline variants, highlighting the value of combined somatic and germline analysis. The linkage of WGS and longitudinal life course clinical data allowed the assessment of treatment outcomes for patients stratified according to pangenomic markers. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linking genomic and real-world clinical data to enable survival analysis to identify cancer genes that affect prognosis and advance our understanding of how cancer genomics impacts patient outcomes.},

Immunotherapies, including the programmed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab, have resulted in durable responses and long-term overall survival in patients with NSCLC. We hypothesized that combining targeted therapy with immunotherapy could result in more patients with responses and/or more durable responses. Herein we report data from a study assessing nivolumab plus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK translocation�𢖯ositive NSCLC. Methods Group E in CheckMate 370 was a single-arm cohort designed to evaluate the safety of first-line nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) plus crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) in patients with ALK translocation�𢖯ositive NSCLC. The primary endpoint of safety would be met if ��20\% of patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events by week 17. Objective response rate was a secondary endpoint. A planned safety review occurred in November 2016; the data cutoff was May 26, 2017. Results Of the first 13 patients treated with nivolumab plus crizotinib, 5 (38\%) developed severe hepatic toxicities leading to the discontinuation of the combination. Of these, two patients died and the presence of severe hepatic toxicities may have contributed to death. Enrollment was closed and combination treatment discontinued due to observed grade ��3 hepatic toxicities. Five patients (38\%) had a partial response. Conclusions These findings do not support further evaluation of nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks plus crizotinib 250 mg twice daily.}

  abstract = {Purpose While various studies have highlighted the prognostic significance of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAT), the impact of additional adjuvant therapy after pCR is not known. Experimental Design PubMed was searched for studies with NAT for breast cancer and individual patient-level data was extracted for analysis using plot digitizer software. Hazard ratios (HRs), with 95\% probability intervals (PIs), measuring the association between pCR and overall survival (OS) or event-free survival (EFS), were estimated using Bayesian piecewise-exponential proportional hazards hierarchical models including pCR as predictor. Results Overall, 52 of 3209 publications met inclusion criteria, totaling 27,895 patients. Patients with a pCR after NAT had significantly better EFS (HR 0.31, 95\% PI: 0.24–0.39), particularly for triple negative (HR 0.18, 95\% PI: 0.10–0.31) and HER2+ (HR 0.32, 95\% PI: 0.21–0.47) disease. Similarly, pCR after NAT was also associated with improved survival (HR 0.22, 95\% PI: 0.15–0.30). The association of pCR with improved EFS was similar among patients who received subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.36, 95\% PI: 0.19–0.67) and those without adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.36, 95\% PI: 0.27–0.54), with no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.60). Interpretation Achieving pCR following NAT is associated with significantly better EFS and OS, particularly for triple negative and HER2+ breast cancer. The similar outcomes with or without adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who attain pCR likely reflects tumor biology and systemic clearance of micrometastatic disease, highlighting the potential of escalation/de-escalation strategies in the adjuvant setting based on neoadjuvant response.},

He sought for follow-up treatment after his disease progressed again. Diagnosis The patient had a tumor diagnosed with stage I (T1bN0M0) lung adenocarcinoma. Interventions Due to the surgical contraindication, the patient did not undergo surgical resection. Instead, he received crizotinib as the first-line therapy with the progression-free survival of 20 months. Then he switched to alectinib treatment, however the disease rapidly progressed again. Outcomes Next-generation sequencing was performed and revealed that 7 somatic mutations were identified. Among them, 2 mutations, ALK I1171T and BRAF V600E, may be responsible for the resistance of this patient to ALK-TKIs. BRAF V600E mutation may explain the patient's resistance to lorlatinib. Lessons We present a case of ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma with acquired resistance to ALK inhibition, in which the BRAF V600E mutation is a novel resistance mechanism. This provides evidence that BRAF V600E mutation is one mechanism of ALK-TKI resistance.}

  abstract = {Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICBs), in addition to targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, novel targeting LAG-3 drugs have also been approved in clinical application. With the widespread use of the drug, we must deeply analyze the dilemma of the agents and seek a breakthrough in the treatment prospect. Over the past decades, these agents have demonstrated dramatic efficacy, especially in patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nonetheless, in the field of a broad concept of solid tumours, non-specific indications, inseparable immune response and side effects, unconfirmed progressive disease, and complex regulatory networks of immune resistance are four barriers that limit its widespread application. Fortunately, the successful clinical trials of novel ICB agents and combination therapies, the advent of the era of oncolytic virus gene editing, and the breakthrough of the technical barriers of mRNA vaccines and nano-delivery systems have made remarkable breakthroughs currently. In this review, we enumerate the mechanisms of each immune checkpoint targets, associations between ICB with tumour mutation burden, key immune regulatory or resistance signalling pathways, the specific clinical evidence of the efficacy of classical targets and new targets among different tumour types and put forward dialectical thoughts on drug safety. Finally, we discuss the importance of accurate triage of ICB based on recent advances in predictive biomarkers and diagnostic testing techniques.},

Clinical samples were tested for EGFR mutations by peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid PCR clamp, and patients having EGFR mutations were given gefitinib 250 mg daily as the second treatment after chemotherapy. Poor PS patients omitted chemotherapy. Of 107 consecutive patients enrolled, samples from 100 patients were informative, and EGFR mutations were observed in 38 patients. Gefitinib was given to 27 patients with EGFR mutations, and the response rate was 78\% (one complete response and 20 partial responses; 95\% confidence interval: 58-93\%). Median time to progression and median survival time (MST) from gefitinib treatment were 9.4 and 15.4 months, respectively. Grade 3 hepatic toxicity and skin toxicity were observed in one patient each. There were significant differences between EGFR mutations and wild-type patients in response rates (78 vs 14\%, P = 0.0017), and MST (15.4 vs 11.1 months, P = 0.0135). A Cox proportional hazards model indicated that negative EGFR mutation was a secondary prognostic factor (hazards ratio: 2.259, P = 0.036). This research showed the need for screening for EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients.}

In this French retrospective multicentre cohort, we included patients with a mCRC treated with either FOLFIRI-aflibercept or FOLFIRI-bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR: CR + PR + SD) and safety. We included 681 patients from 36 centers, 326 and 355 in the aflibercept and bevacizumab groups, respectively. Median age was 64.2 years and 45.2\% of patients were men. Most patients had RAS-mutated tumors (80.8\%) and synchronous metastases (85.7\%). After a median follow up of 31.2 months, median OS was 13.0 months (95\% CI: 11.3-14.7) and 10.4 months (95\% CI: 8.8-11.4) in the bevacizumab and aflibercept groups, respectively (P {$<$} .0001).

  abstract = {The advent of high-throughput sequencing has allowed to profoundly interrogate the molecular landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the last years. These findings constitute the opportunity to better stratify these patients in order to address specific treatments to well-defined oncogene-restricted subgroups. Among them, BRAF-mutated lung cancers represent around 4\% of NSCLC, thus identifying a clinically relevant popu­ lation that should be aptly managed. Pivotal phase II trials have demonstrated the efficacy of combinatorial treatment - dabrafenib plus trametinib, targeting both BRAF and MEK - for patients harboring V600E mutations, making this specific BRAF alteration a mandatory requirement in the genetic portrait of advanced non-squamous lung cancer patients. However, around half of BRAF+ NSCLC patients remain orphan of targeted approaches. Here we review the available evidence, mainly from a clinical perspective, of therapeutic strategies for both V600E and non-V600 patients, in terms of small molecule, immune checkpoint inhibitors and forthcoming in­ tegrated strategies. Looking at on-going clinical trials, a special attention is dedicated to emergent molecules and combinatorial strategies that not only will improve outcomes of classical V600E, but also will make concrete the chance of tailored treatments for the majority of BRAF-mutated patients.},

Ramucirumab is a human IgG-1 monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor 2. We assessed the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab versus placebo in combination with second-line FOLFIRI (leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) for metastatic colorectal cancer in patients with disease progression during or after first-line therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine. METHODS: Between Dec 14, 2010, and Aug 23, 2013, we enrolled patients into the multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 RAISE trial. Eligible patients had disease progression during or within 6 months of the last dose of first-line therapy. Patients were randomised (1:1) via a centralised, interactive voice-response system to receive 8 mg/kg intravenous ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI or matching placebo plus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or death. Randomisation was stratified by region, KRAS mutation status, and time to disease progression after starting first-line treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01183780.ld FINDINGS: We enrolled 1072 patients (536 in each group). Median overall survival was 13·3 months (95\% CI 12·4-14·5) for patients in the ramucirumab group versus 11·7 months (10·8-12·7) for the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·844 95\% CI 0·730-0·976; log-rank p=0·0219). Survival benefit was consistent across subgroups of patients who received ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI. Grade 3 or worse adverse events seen in more than 5\% of patients were neutropenia (203 [38\%] of 529 patients in the ramucirumab group vs 123 [23\%] of 528 in the placebo group, with febrile neutropenia incidence of 18 [3\%] vs 13 [2\%]), hypertension (59 [11\%] vs 15 [3\%]), diarrhoea (57 [11\%] vs 51 [10\%]), and fatigue (61 [12\%] vs 41 [8\%]). INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival compared with placebo plus FOLFIRI as second-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. No unexpected adverse events were identified and toxic effects were manageable. FUNDING: Eli Lilly.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who progress on platinum-based combination chemotherapy (PLT) and checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have limited options that offer objective response rates (ORRs) of approximately 10\% with a median overall survival (OS) of 7-8 months. Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a TROP-2–directed antibody-drug conjugate with an SN-38 payload that has shown preliminary activity in mUC. METHODS TROPHY-U-01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03547973) is a multicohort, open-label, phase II, registrational study. Cohort 1 includes patients with locally advanced or unresectable or mUC who had progressed after prior PLT and CPI. Patients received SG 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles. The primary outcome was centrally reviewed ORR; secondary outcomes were progression-free survival, OS, duration of response, and safety. RESULTS Cohort 1 included 113 patients (78\% men; median age, 66 years; 66.4\% visceral metastases; median of three [range, 1-8] prior therapies). At a median follow-up of 9.1 months, the ORR was 27\% (31 of 113; 95\% CI, 19.5 to 36.6); 77\% had decrease in measurable disease. Median duration of response was 7.2 months (95\% CI, 4.7 to 8.6 months), with median progression-free survival and OS of 5.4 months (95\% CI, 3.5 to 7.2 months) and 10.9 months (95\% CI, 9.0 to 13.8 months), respectively. Key grade \$ 3 treatment-related adverse events included neutropenia (35\%), leukopenia (18\%), anemia (14\%), diarrhea (10\%), and febrile neutropenia (10\%), with 6\% discontinuing treatment because of treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSION SG is an active drug with a manageable safety profile with most common toxicities of neutropenia and diarrhea. SG has notable efficacy compared with historical controls in pretreated mUC that has progressed on both prior PLT regimens and CPI. The results from this study supported accelerated approval of SG in this population.},

EML4-ALK is most often detected in never smokers with lung cancer and has unique pathologic features. EML4-ALK is oncogenic both in vitro and in vivo and ALK kinase inhibitors are quite effective in pre-clinical model systems. More recently ALK inhibitors have entered clinical development and remarkably clinical efficacy has been observed in NSCLC patients harbouring EML4-ALK translocations. This review will focus on the biology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of EML4-ALK NSCLC.}

ALK inhibitors show a very high response rate to ALK-positive NSCLCs. However, the emergence of acquired resistance is inevitable. In this study, we investigated the drugs for overcoming resistance especially compound mutations after sequential treatment with crizotinib, alectinib, and lorlatinib. Method Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing were performed on a liver biopsy tissue obtained from a clinical case. Ba/F3 cells in which mutant EML4-ALK were overexpressed were prepared, and cell viability assay and immunoblotting were performed to check the sensitivity of five independent ALK inhibitors. Results I1171S + G1269A double mutation was identified by NGS and Sanger sequencing on a liver biopsy tissue from a patient who relapsed on lorlatinib treatment. Ceritinib and brigatinib-but not other ALK inhibitors-were active against the compound mutations in the cell line model. Conclusions With the sequential ALK inhibitors treatment, cancer cells accumulate new mutations in addition to mutations acquired previously. The identified compound mutation (I1171S + G1269A) was found to be sensitive to ceritinib and brigatinib, and indeed the patient's tumor partially responded to ceritinib. Key points ALK compound mutation was found in a clinical sample that was resistant to lorlatinib after sequential ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Ceritinib and brigatinib are potential overcoming drugs against ALK I1171S + G1269A double mutation.}

  abstract = {BRAF mutations constitute an important poor prognostic factor in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and the development of treatments in this context is of great necessity to prolong patient survival. Although the association between BRAF mutations and microsatellite instability (MSI) has been known for several years, previous clinical trials have revealed that the former has a limited prognostic impact and that immune checkpoint inhibitors offer a significant survival benefit to mCRC patients with both characteristics. Furthermore, the genomic classification of BRAF mutations according to their molecular functions enables greater understanding of the characteristics of mCRC patients with BRAF mutations, with therapeutic strategies based on this classification made more ideal to improve poor prognosis through the delivery of targeted therapies. Recently, a phase III trial was conducted in previously treated mCRC patients with BRAF V600E–mutated tumors and revealed that the combination therapy approach of BRAF inhibition and anti–epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy with or without MEK inhibition was more efficacious than standard chemotherapy alone. This review discusses current treatment strategies and future perspectives in BRAF-mutated mCRC.},

The combination of EGFR-TKI afatinib and anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab can overcome acquired resistance in mouse models and human patients. Since afatinib is also a potent HER2 inhibitor, we investigated the role of HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumor cells. We show in vitro and in vivo that afatinib plus cetuximab significantly inhibits HER2 phosphorylation. HER2 overexpression or knockdown confers resistance or sensitivity, respectively, in all studied cell line models. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that HER2 was amplified in 12\% of tumors with acquired resistance versus only 1\% of untreated lung adenocarcinomas. Notably, HER2 amplification and EGFR T790M were mutually exclusive. Collectively, these results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of resistance to EGFR TKIs and provide a rationale to assess the status and possibly target HER2 in EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.}

Automating the interpretation and reporting of sequencing results decrease the need for time-consuming manual procedures that are prone to errors. The adoption of an expert-agreed process to systematically link tumor molecular profiles with clinical actions promotes consistent decision-making and structured data capture across the connected centers. The use of information-rich patient reports with interactive content facilitates collaborative discussion of complex cases during virtual molecular tumor board meetings. Overall, streamlined digital systems like the MTBP are crucial to better address the challenges brought by precision oncology and accelerate the use of emerging biomarkers.},

Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, chemotherapy-naive patients or patients with recurrences after up to two prior chemotherapy regimens were eligible. Direct sequencing using DNA from tumour specimens was performed by a central laboratory to detect EGFR mutations. Patients harbouring EGFR mutations received gefitinib. The primary study objective was response; the secondary objectives were toxicity, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year survival (1Y-S) and the disease control rate (DCR). Between March 2005 and January 2006, 118 patients were recruited from 15 institutions and were screened for EGFR mutations, which were detected in 32 patients �� 28 of whom were enrolled in the present study. The overall response rate was 75\%, the DCR was 96\% and the median PFS was 11.5 months. The median OS has not yet been reached, and the 1Y-S was 79\%. Thus, gefitinib chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations was highly effective. This trial documents the feasibility of performing a multicentre phase II study using a central typing laboratory, demonstrating the benefit to patients of selecting gefitinib treatment based on their EGFR mutation status.}

We hypothesize that enhancing apoptosis through combination therapies can eradicate cancer cells and reduce the emergence of drug-tolerant persisters. Through high-throughput screening of a custom library of ��1,000 compounds, we discover Aurora B kinase inhibitors as potent enhancers of osimertinib-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, Aurora B inhibition stabilizes BIM through reduced Ser87 phosphorylation, and transactivates PUMA through FOXO1/3. Importantly, osimertinib resistance caused by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activates the ATR-CHK1-Aurora B signaling cascade and thereby engenders hypersensitivity to respective kinase inhibitors by activating BIM-mediated mitotic catastrophe. Combined inhibition of EGFR and Aurora B not only efficiently eliminates cancer cells but also overcomes resistance beyond EMT.}

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:title{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/jats:title{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}ALK receptor tyrosine kinase can be aberrantly activated by gene rearrangement or point mutation to drive tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. ALK rearrangements are detected in up to 5\% of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and up to 40\% of patients present with brain metastases at diagnosis. Crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib are FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors for ALK-positive NSCLC. However, durability of response to these treatments is partly limited by mutations in ALK that confer resistance. The G1202R solvent front mutation is commonly observed in patients that have progressed on crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, or brigatinib. Patients with tumors harboring G1202R have responded to lorlatinib, but many have relapsed after acquiring compound mutations such as G1202R/L1196M and G1202R/G1269A. Another challenge with lorlatinib is central nervous system (CNS) adverse events attributed to inhibition of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TRKB), a kinase structurally related to ALK. NVL-655 is a novel preclinical brain-penetrant ALK inhibitor with selectivity over TRKB. We previously reported that NVL-655 inhibits ALK G1202R, G1202R/L1196M, G1202R/G1269A, and G1202R/L1198F in vitro; has favorable kinome and ALK-vs-TRKB selectivity profiles; and shows antitumor activity in a Ba/F3 EML4-ALK variant 1 (v1) G1202R/L1196M xenograft model. Here we report results of a broader preclinical characterization of NVL-655 across ALK models, including an intracranial model. NVL-655 was observed to induce regression in a HIP1-ALK patient-derived xenograft model, an EML4-ALK v1 human cancer cell line-derived model (NCI-H3122), and Ba/F3 xenograft models expressing EML4-ALK v1 G1202R and G1202R/G1269A. Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker analyses supported in vivo ALK inhibition by NVL-655. Furthermore, NVL-655 was observed to reduce tumor size and prolong survival by more than 4-fold in a mouse intracranial tumor model of Ba/F3 EML4-ALK v1 G1202R/L1196M luciferase. In conclusion, NVL-655 has a preclinical profile that we believe supports its potential to address a medical need for patients with ALK-positive disease, including those with G1202R compound mutations. We believe the findings presented here support the evaluation of NVL-655 for the treatment of patients with ALK-driven disease.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Citation Format: Anupong Tangpeerachaikul, Amit Deshpande, Nancy E.

However, some patients show intrinsic resistance and an insufficient response to osimertinib. This study showed that osimertinib stimulated AXL by inhibiting a negative feedback loop. Activated AXL was associated with EGFR and HER3 in maintaining cell survival and inducing the emergence of cells tolerant to osimertinib. AXL inhibition reduced the viability of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cells overexpressing AXL that were exposed to osimertinib. The addition of an AXL inhibitor during either the initial or tolerant phases reduced tumor size and delayed tumor re-growth compared to osimertinib alone. AXL was highly expressed in clinical specimens of EGFR-mutated lung cancers and its high expression was associated with a low response rate to EGFR-TKI. These results indicated pivotal roles for AXL and its inhibition in the intrinsic resistance to osimertinib and the emergence of osimertinib-tolerant cells.}

This landmark advancement has however raised several important scientific questions. Indeed, we desperately need strategies to identify upfront patients deriving benefit from the addition of immunotherapy. Moreover, the best integration of pembrolizumab with further recent advancements (capecitabine, olaparib) is yet to be defined.

We first performed next-generation sequencing of cfDNA from seven subjects and detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one; expression of this mutant EGFR construct in a cell line rendered it resistant to AZD9291. We then performed droplet digital PCR on serial cfDNA specimens collected from 15 AZD9291-treated subjects. All were positive for the T790M mutation before treatment, but upon developing AZD9291 resistance three molecular subtypes emerged: six cases acquired the C797S mutation, five cases maintained the T790M mutation but did not acquire the C797S mutation and four cases lost the T790M mutation despite the presence of the underlying EGFR activating mutation. Our findings provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to AZD9291 and highlight the need for therapies that are able to overcome resistance mediated by the EGFR C797S mutation.}

  abstract = {Allosteric kinase inhibitors offer a potentially complementary therapeutic strategy to ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors due to their distinct sites of target binding. In this study, we identify and study a mutant-selective EGFR allosteric inhibitor, JBJ-04-125-02, which as a single agent can inhibit cell proliferation and EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S signaling in vitro and in vivo. However, increased EGFR dimer formation limits treatment efficacy and leads to drug resistance. Remarkably, osimertinib, an ATP-competitive covalent EGFR inhibitor, uniquely and significantly enhances the binding of JBJ-04-125-02 for mutant EGFR. The combination of osimertinib and JBJ-04-125-02 results in an increase in apoptosis, a more effective inhibition of cellular growth, and an increased efficacy in vitro and in vivo compared with either single agent alone. Collectively, our findings suggest that the combination of a covalent mutant-selective ATP-competitive inhibitor and an allosteric EGFR inhibitor may be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: The clinical efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in EGFR-mutant lung cancer is limited by acquired drug resistance, thus highlighting the need for alternative strategies to inhibit EGFR. Here, we identify a mutant EGFR allosteric inhibitor that is effective as a single agent and in combination with the EGFR TKI osimertinib.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813.}

  abstract = {Purpose In metastatic colorectal cancer, phase III studies have demonstrated the superiority of fluorouracil (FU) with leucovorin (LV) in combination with irinotecan or oxaliplatin over FU + LV alone. This phase III study investigated two sequences: folinic acid, FU, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) followed by folinic acid, FU, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6; arm A), and FOLFOX6 followed by FOLFIRI (arm B). Patients and Methods Previously untreated patients with assessable disease were randomly assigned to receive a 2-hour infusion of l-LV 200 mg/m2 or dl-LV 400 mg/m2 followed by a FU bolus 400 mg/m2 and 46-hour infusion 2,400 to 3,000 mg/m2 every 46 hours every 2 weeks, either with irinotecan 180 mg/m2 or with oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on day 1. At progression, irinotecan was replaced by oxaliplatin (arm A), or oxaliplatin by irinotecan (arm B). Results Median survival was 21.5 months in 109 patients allocated to FOLFIRI then FOLFOX6 versus 20.6 months in 111 patients allocated to FOLFOX6 then FOLFIRI (P = .99). Median second progression-free survival (PFS) was 14.2 months in arm A versus 10.9 in arm B (P = .64). In first-line therapy, FOLFIRI achieved 56\% response rate (RR) and 8.5 months median PFS, versus FOLFOX6 which achieved 54\% RR and 8.0 months median PFS (P = .26). Second-line FOLFIRI achieved 4\% RR and 2.5 months median PFS, versus FOLFOX6 which achieved 15\% RR and 4.2 months PFS. In first-line therapy, National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3/4 mucositis, nausea/vomiting, and grade 2 alopecia were more frequent with FOLFIRI, and grade 3/4 neutropenia and neurosensory toxicity were more frequent with FOLFOX6. Conclusion Both sequences achieved a prolonged survival and similar efficacy. The toxicity profiles were different.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In metastatic colorectal cancer, a combination of leucovorin (LV) and fluorouracil (FU) with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) 4 is a standard first-line regimen. The cumulative neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin often requires therapy to be stopped in patients who are still responding. This study evaluates a new strategy of intermittent oxaliplatin treatment that is based on FOLFOX7, a simplified leucovorin and fluorouracil regimen with high-dose oxaliplatin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients were randomly assigned to either FOLFOX4 administered every 2 weeks until progression (arm A) or FOLFOX7 for six cycles, maintenance without oxaliplatin for 12 cycles, and reintroduction of FOLFOX7 (arm B). RESULTS: Six hundred twenty patients were enrolled, including an exploratory cohort of 95 elderly or poor prognosis patients. Median progression-free survival and survival times were 9.0 and 19.3 months, respectively, in patients allocated to arm A compared with 8.7 and 21.2 months, respectively, in patients allocated to arm B (P = not significant). Response rates were 58.5\% with arm A and 59.2\% with arm B. National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed in 54.4\% of the patients in arm A v 48.7\% of patients in arm B. From cycle 7, fewer patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity in arm B. Grade 3 sensory neuropathy was observed in 17.9\% of the patients in arm A v 13.3\% of patients in arm B (P = .12). In arm B, oxaliplatin was reintroduced in only 40.1\% of the patients but achieved responses or stabilizations in 69.4\% of these patients. CONCLUSION: Oxaliplatin can be safely stopped after six cycles in a FOLFOX regimen. Further study is needed to fully evaluate oxaliplatin reintroduction.},

  abstract = {Over the past 15 years, rapid progress has been made in developmental therapeutics, especially regarding the use of matched targeted therapies against specific oncogenic molecular alterations across cancer types. Molecular tumour boards (MTBs) are panels of expert physicians, scientists, health-care providers and patient advocates who review and interpret molecular-profiling results for individual patients with cancer and match each patient to available therapies, which can include investigational drugs. Interpretation of the molecular alterations found in each patient is a complicated task that requires an understanding of their contextual functional effects and their correlations with sensitivity or resistance to specific treatments. The criteria for determining the actionability of molecular alterations and selecting matched treatments are constantly evolving. Therefore, MTBs have an increasingly necessary role in optimizing the allocation of biomarker-directed therapies and the implementation of precision oncology. Ultimately, increased MTB availability, accessibility and performance are likely to improve patient care. The challenges faced by MTBs are increasing, owing to the plethora of identifiable molecular alterations and immune markers in tumours of individual patients and their evolving clinical significance as more and more data on patient outcomes and results from clinical trials become available. Beyond next-generation sequencing, broader biomarker analyses can provide useful information. However, greater funding, resources and expertise are needed to ensure the sustainability of MTBs and expand their outreach to underserved populations. Harmonization between practice and policy will be required to optimally implement precision oncology. Herein, we discuss the evolving role of MTBs and current and future considerations for their use in precision oncology.},

  abstract = {Osimertinib has been demonstrated to overcome the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-T790M, the most relevant acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). However, the C797S mutation, which impairs the covalent binding between the cysteine residue at position 797 of EGFR and osimertinib, induces resistance to osimertinib. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the C797S/T790M/activating-mutation (triple-mutation)-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance. In the present study, we identify brigatinib to be effective against triple-mutation-harbouring cells in vitro and in vivo. Our original computational simulation demonstrates that brigatinib fits into the ATP-binding pocket of triple-mutant EGFR. The structure-activity relationship analysis reveals the key component in brigatinib to inhibit the triple-mutant EGFR. The efficacy of brigatinib is enhanced markedly by combination with anti-EGFR antibody because of the decrease of surface and total EGFR expression. Thus, the combination therapy of brigatinib with anti-EGFR antibody is a powerful candidate to overcome triple-mutant EGFR.}

  abstract = {Background: Biomarker-driven lung adenocarcinomas involving alterations in oncogenic drivers such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and NTRK have witnessed a dramatic shift in the therapeutic and prognostic landscape owing to the development of molecular targeted therapies. The recent approval of the selective RET inhibitor, selpercatinib, has led to an ardent interest in RET-rearranged non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, sequential single-gene testing cannot detect RET rearrangements accurately or characterize the fusion partners. Objectives: We aimed to determine the incidence and types of RET alterations in our patients with NSCLC, and to describe the demographic and clinical profile of our patients with RET-driven NSCLC. In addition, our aim was to highlight the advantages of broader panel-based testing by the next generation sequencing (NGS) over single-gene assays. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective, case series of patients with advanced NSCLC who underwent testing by NGS between December 2018 and August 2020 at our center, with a focus on the cases who were found to have the RET gene rearrangement. The demographic, clinicopathological profiles, and treatment details were retrieved from the medical record archives. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 23 for Windows. Results: A total of 169 patients were enrolled in the study. RET rearrangement was detected in 2.9\% (n = 5) of the patients in our cohort. Four cases had the KIF5B-RET fusion, and one case had the CCDC6-RET fusion. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 45��82), with a slight female preponderance (men: 2 and women: 3). The RET fusions were detected using an NGS-based assay. Four out of the five patients were administered pemetrexed-carboplatin-based chemotherapy and are alive and on regular follow-up. One patient did not receive any treatment and has succumbed to the disease. One patient has been administered selpercatinib after failing many lines of chemotherapy. Conclusions: The emergence of newer molecular targets necessitates the use of an broader panel-based NGS testing to detect oncogene addiction in NSCLC. This case series highlights the importance of NGS-based testing in the light of the recent approval of selpercatinib for RET-rearranged NSCLC.}

Gene rearrangements can be identified using many techniques including fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), reverse transcriptase-PCR, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for fusion oncoprotein expression. We aimed to determine the concordance between IHC, FISH and NGS for ALK biomarker detection, and determine differences in sensitivity, and survival outcomes. Methods We analysed the concordance between IHC using D5F3 monoclonal antibody, FISH (break-apart) and NGS using a custom panel containing 71 different ALK variants. Results Among 71 cases included in this study, FISH was evaluable in 58 cases. The concordance of ALK IHC with FISH was 75.9\% and that with NGS was 84.5\%. The sensitivities of FISH and NGS were 75.6\% and 87.5\%, respectively. The median progression-free survival of ALK IHC-positive and FISH-negative group was 5.5 months and that of both positive was 9.97 months.

  abstract = {Postobstructive pneumonia can complicate lung cancer, particularly in more advanced stages of the disease, producing significant clinical decline and a poorer prognosis. It can lead to complications such as empyema, lung abscess and fistula formation. Postobstructive pneumonia can also be the first manifestation of an underlying malignancy. There are multiple challenges in the management of these patients. Recognition and treatment of this entity can be complex and includes the use of imaging, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover the wide variety of microorganisms involved and the use of different interventional modalities to relieve the obstruction. Existing literature on postobstructive pneumonia is scarce. In this article, we review the pathophysiology, different diagnostic methods and the therapeutic options to treat this condition. The utility and efficacy of the various modalities that are currently available in clinical practice to the interventional pulmonologist are described in some detail.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) commonly involves a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen such as infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) or fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, often combined with bevacizumab or an epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody. We studied the effect of adding the novel antiangiogenic agent aflibercept (also known as ziv-aflibercept in the United States) to FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC previously treated with oxaliplatin, including patients who received prior bevacizumab.                                         Patients and Methods               Patients were randomly assigned to receive aflibercept (4 mg/kg intravenously; 612 patients) or placebo (614 patients) every 2 weeks in combination with FOLFIRI. Treatment was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was overall survival.                                         Results               Adding aflibercept to FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival relative to placebo plus FOLFIRI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.817; 95.34\% CI, 0.713 to 0.937; P = .0032) with median survival times of 13.50 versus 12.06 months, respectively. Aflibercept also significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 0.758; 95\% CI, 0.661 to 0.869; P {$<$} .0001), with median PFS times of 6.90 versus 4.67 months, respectively. The effects on overall survival and PFS exhibited a consistent trend across prespecified subgroup analyses, including bevacizumab pretreated patients. Response rate was 19.8\% (95\% CI, 16.4\% to 23.2\%) with aflibercept plus FOLFIRI compared with 11.1\% (95\% CI, 8.5\% to 13.8\%) with placebo plus FOLFIRI (P = .0001). Adverse effects reported with aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI included the characteristic anti–vascular endothelial growth factor effects and also reflected an increased incidence of some chemotherapy-related toxicities.                                         Conclusion               Aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI conferred a statistically significant survival benefit over FOLFIRI combined with placebo in patients with mCRC previously treated with oxaliplatin.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We compared the activity of panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) to that of BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had progressed after standard chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 463 patients with 1\% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, measurable disease, and radiologic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months of most recent chemotherapy to panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus BSC (n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Tumor assessments by blinded central review were scheduled from week 8 until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, overall survival (OS), and safety. BSC patients who progressed could receive panitumumab in a cross-over study. RESULTS: Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95\% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P {$<$} .0001]). Median PFS time was 8 weeks (95\% CI, 7.9 to 8.4) for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks (95\% CI, 7.1 to 7.7) for BSC. Mean (standard error) PFS time was 13.8 (0.8) weeks for panitumumab and 8.5 (0.5) weeks for BSC. Objective response rates also favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10\% for panitumumab and 0\% for BSC (P {$<$} .0001). No difference was observed in OS (HR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.22), which was confounded by similar activity of panitumumab after 76\% of BSC patients entered the cross-over study. Panitumumab was well tolerated. Skin toxicities, hypomagnesaemia, and diarrhea were the most common toxicities observed. No patients had grade 3/4 infusion reactions. CONCLUSION: Panitumumab significantly improved PFS with manageable toxicity in patients with chemorefractory colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates the efficacy of capecitabine using data from a large, well-characterised population of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated in two identically designed phase III studies. A total of 1207 patients with previously untreated mCRC were randomised to either oral capecitabine (1250 mg m(-2) twice daily, days 1-14 every 21 days; n=603) or intravenous (i.v.) bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV; Mayo Clinic regimen; n=604). Capecitabine demonstrated a statistically significant superior response rate compared with 5-FU/LV (26 vs 17\%; P{$<$}0.0002). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that capecitabine consistently resulted in superior response rates (P{$<$}0.05), even in patient subgroups with poor prognostic indicators. The median time to response and duration of response were similar and time to progression (TTP) was equivalent in the two arms (hazard ratio (HR) 0.997, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.885-1.123, P=0.95; median 4.6 vs 4.7 months with capecitabine and 5-FU/LV, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified younger age, liver metastases, multiple metastases and poor Karnofsky Performance Status as independent prognostic indicators for poor TTP. Overall survival was equivalent in the two arms (HR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.84-1.06, P=0.48; median 12.9 vs 12.8 months, respectively). Capecitabine results in superior response rate, equivalent TTP and overall survival, an improved safety profile and improved convenience compared with i.v. 5-FU/LV as first-line treatment for MCRC. For patients in whom fluoropyrimidine monotherapy is indicated, capecitabine should be strongly considered. Following encouraging results from phase I and II trials, randomised trials are evaluating capecitabine in combination with irinotecan, oxaliplatin and radiotherapy. Capecitabine is a suitable replacement for i.v. 5-FU as the backbone of colorectal cancer therapy.},

Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis of advanced ALK positive NSCLC patients who were treated from June 2012 to September 2015 was conducted. The primary goal was to evaluate outcomes of advanced ALK positive NSCLC in our practice and examine the logistic constraints in procuring Crizotinib. Results 94 patients were available for analysis. 21 (22.3\%) patients were started on Crizotinib upfront, 60 (63.8\%) on chemotherapy, 10 (10.6\%) on Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (in view of poor PS) and 3 (3.2\%) patients were offered best supportive care. Reasons for not starting Crizotinib upfront included symptomatic patients needing early initiation of therapy (23.3\%), ALK not tested upfront (23.3\%) and financial constraints (21.9\%). 69 patients (73.4\%) received Crizotinib at some stage during treatment. Dose interruptions ({$>$} 1 week) with Crizotinib were seen in 20 patients (29\%), with drug toxicity being the commonest reason (85\%). Median Progression free survival (PFS) on first line therapy for the entire cohort was 10 months, with a significant difference between patients receiving Crizotinib and those who did not ever receive Crizotinib (10 months vs. 2 months, p = 0.028). Median Overall Survival (OS) was not reached for the entire cohort, with 1 year survival being 81.2\%. Patients with an ECOG Performance Status (PS) of {$>$}2 had a significantly reduced PFS compared to patients with PS {$<$} = 2 (1.5 months vs. 11 months, p{$<$} 0.001). 47 patients with financial constraints (68.1\%) received Crizotinib completely free via various extramural support schemes. Conclusion A majority of our ALK positive NSCLC patients were exposed to Crizotinib through the help of various support mechanisms and these patients had similar outcomes to that reported from previously published literature.}

The optimal antibody combination is unknown. Methods: Patients (pts) with KRAS wild-type (wt)(codons 12 and 13) MCRC and performance status 0-1 received FOLFIRI or mFOLFOX6 (MD/pt choice at enrollment) and randomized to either CET 400 mg/m2 X 1, then 250 mg/m2 qw or BV 5 mg/kg q2w. The original study included unselected MCRC pts receiving FOLFIRI or mFOLFOX6 and randomized to CET, BV, or both. After 1,420 pts accrued the study amended as follows: only pts with KRAS wt tumors (codon 12 and 13) were included and the combination CET + BV arm was deleted. Rx continued until progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, curative surgery; treatment holidays of 4 wks permitted. Subsequent Rx not mandated. Accrual goal was 1,142 pts. One° endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: Between November 2005 and March 2012, 3,058 unselected pts enrolled, 2,334 KRAS wt pts randomized; final N =1137 (333 pre-amend eligible retrospective KRAS test, 804 post-amend), median f/u = 24 mos; Median age – 59 y; 61\% male. Chemo/BV – 559; chemo/CET – 578. FOLFIRI = 26.6\%, mFOLFOX6 = 73.4\%. OS analysis planned at 849 events; efficacy futility boundary crossed at 10th interim analysis on 1/29/14. OS - chemo/BV v. chemo/CET = 29.04 (25.66 - 31.21) v. 29.93 (27.56 - 31.21) mos; HR = 0.92 (0.78, 1.09) (p value = 0.34). PFS (by investigator): chemo/BV v. chemo/CET: 10.84 (9.86 - 11.4) v. 10.45 (9.66 - 11.33) mos. There were 94 pts free of disease following surgery, median f/u 40 mos (range 8.0 - 86.0). Outcomes similar by gender. On-study toxicity and deaths as expected. Analyses underway: Expanded RAS, FOLFOX v. FOLFIRI, subsequent therapies, long-term survivors, correlates. Conclusions: Chemo/CET and chemo/BV equivalent in OS in pts KRAS wt (codons 12 + 13) MCRC; either is appropriate in first line. Overall OS of 29 + mos and 8\% long-term survivors confirms progress in MCRC. The preference for FOLFOX limits chemotherapy comparison. Expanded RAS and other molecular and clinical analyses may identify subsets of pts who get more or less benefit from specific regimens. Clinical trial information: NCT00265850.},

  abstract = {Introduction Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) gene rearrangement characterizes a subgroup of patients with lung adenocarcinoma who may benefit from ALK inhibitors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a break-apart/split-signal strategy is the gold standard to investigate ALK . The cutoff to define ALK positivity has been settled at 15\% or greater. A subset of patients has ALK borderline status, showing 15\% 簣 5\% positive cells. Several aspects, both biological and technical, might influence signals evaluation, making FISH interpretation a challenging task. To improve ALK evaluation, we classified the different FISH patterns on the basis of the type of the split signals, namely short, long, far away, and deleted. Methods We investigated ALK gene status by FISH in 244 lung adenocarcinomas and in a series of ALK negative cell lines samples, collected in three Institutions. Results ALK positive profile was found in 12\% of patients; long, deleted, and far-away splits were the primary patterns observed. ALK borderline profile characterized 10\% of samples; long and deleted splits were significantly more frequent in those borderline finally classified as ALK positive, whereas short split were mostly detected in those borderline patients finally classified as ALK negative ( p = 3.4 � 10 ��3 ). In the ALK negative control series, short split was the predominant pattern. Concordance was observed among different operators and probes for both samples and controls. Conclusions Difficulties in ALK FISH signal interpretation might be bypassed using this detailed scoring system, which is highly reproducible, helps clarify borderline samples (according to split type), and provides experimental evidence that 15\% is a reasonable cutoff to overcome the assay-dependent background noise.}

Here, we show that a vaccine against ALK induced a strong and specific immune response that both prophylactically and therapeutically impaired the growth of ALK-positive lung tumors in mouse models. The ALK vaccine was efficacious also in combination with ALK TKI treatment and significantly delayed tumor relapses after TKI suspension. We found that lung tumors containing ALK rearrangements induced an immunosuppressive microenvironment, regulating the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of lung tumor cells. High PD-L1 expression reduced ALK vaccine efficacy, which could be restored by administration of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Thus, combinations of ALK vaccine with TKIs and immune checkpoint blockade therapies might represent a powerful strategy for the treatment of ALK-driven NSCLC.}

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction Multiple genetic mechanisms have been identified in EGFR-mutant lung cancers as mediators of acquired resistance (AR) to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but many cases still lack a known mechanism. Methods To identify novel mechanisms of AR, we performed targeted large panel sequencing of samples from 374 consecutive patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancer, including 174 post-TKI samples, of which 38 also had a matched pre-TKI sample. Alterations hypothesized to confer AR were introduced into drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines (H1975, HCC827, and PC9) by using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 genome editing. MSK-LX138cl, a cell line with EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) and praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 2 gene (PJA2)/BRAF fusion, was generated from an EGFR TKI�𩂈esistant patient sample. Results We identified four patients (2.3\%) with a BRAF fusion (three with acylglycerol kinase gene (AGK)/BRAF and one with PJA2/BRAF) in samples obtained at AR to EGFR TKI therapy (two posterlotinib samples and two posterlotinib and postosimertinib samples). Pre-TKI samples were available for two of four patients and both were negative for BRAF fusion. Induction of AGK/BRAF fusion in H1975 (L858R + T790M), PC9 (ex19del) and HCC827 (ex19del) cells increased phosphorylation of BRAF, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and conferred resistance to growth inhibition by osimertinib. MEK inhibition with trametinib synergized with osimertinib to block growth. Alternately, a pan-RAF inhibitor as a single agent blocked growth of all cell lines with mutant EGFR and BRAF fusion. Conclusion BRAF fusion is a mechanism of AR to EGFR TKI therapy in approximately 2\% of patients. Combined inhibition of EGFR and MEK (with osimertinib and trametinib) or BRAF (with a pan-RAF inhibitor) are potential therapeutic strategies that should be explored.}

  abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step during embryogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role in cancer progression, through which tissue epithelial cancers invade and metastasise. Cell characteristics are highly affected during EMT, resulting in altered cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, cell motility and invasiveness. Nevertheless, the demonstration of this process in human cancer has been proven difficult and controversial. Besides the fact that the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics is not a prerequisite for cell migration/invasion, it is a transient event that concerns only few cells in a tumour mass. The induction of EMT depends on the tumour type and its genetic alterations as well as on its interaction with the extracellular matrix. In parallel, trials for EMT identification in clinical samples lack of a widely accepted methodology, nomenclature and reliable markers. This review summarizes the main EMT characteristics and proposes methodologies for better analysis in vitro. It also highlights recent studies identifying cells with EMT characteristics in human cancer and proposes certain markers to identify them in tumour samples. Finally, it cites the recent literature concerning the mechanisms of drug resistance related to EMT in the context of anti-tumour therapies and proposes related new targets for therapy.}

  abstract = {Purpose Evaluating patients and treatment decisions in a multidisciplinary tumor board has led to better quality of care and longer survival in cancer patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor board recommendations for thoracic oncology patients regarding guideline adherence and transferal of recommendations into clinical practice. Methods We evaluated tumor board recommendations of the thoracic oncology tumor board at Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) Hospital Munich between 2014 and 2016. We compared patient characteristics between guideline-adherent and non-guideline-adherent recommendations, as well as between transferred and non-transferred recommendations. We used multivariate logistic regression models to evaluate factors associated with guideline adherence. Results Over 90\% of recommendations by the tumor board were either adherent to the guidelines (75.5\%) or over fulfilling guidelines (15.6\%). Almost 90\% of recommendations were transferred to clinical practice. If a recommendation was not according to the guidelines, the reason was mostly associated with the general condition (age, Charlson comorbidity index, ECOG) of the patient or due to the patients’ request. Surprisingly, sex also had a significant influence on the guideline adherence of recommendations, with females being more likely to get recommendations not according to the guidelines. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of this study are promising, as the guideline adherence of recommendations as well as the transferal of recommendations into clinical practice were high. In the future, a special focus should be put on fragile patients as well as female patients.

In vitro study proved that cells harboring EGFR C797S in trans with T790M are sensitive to a combination of first- and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, this has not been reported clinically. Methods We performed capture-based sequencing on longitudinal plasma samples obtained at various treatment milestones from a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who was undergoing targeted therapy. Results At the development of resistance to osimertinib, the patient's plasma sample revealed EGFR C797S located in trans with T790M. He achieved partial response accompanied by undetectable C797S after commencement of a combinatorial treatment consisting of erlotinib and osimertinib. After 3 months of progression-free survival, he experienced progressive disease with emergence of EGFR C797S located in cis to T790M. Conclusion We report the first clinical evidence of efficacy generated by combination therapy consisting of first- and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting concomitant EGFR T790M and C797S in trans. We also reveal that the clonal progression of C797S from in trans to in cis at disease progression may serve as a potential resistance mechanism.}

  abstract = {Background: Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring driver oncogene such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement are sensitive to the corresponding molecular targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, acquired resistance inevitably develops, and more effective treatment strategies are needed. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab significantly prolongs progression free survival when added to first-generation EGFR TKIs in EGFR mutant NSCLC. However, it remains unknown whether anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) antibody enhances the efficacy of molecular targeted agents as well. In this study, we investigated combinations with an anti-VEGFR antibody and EGFR or ALK TKIs in preclinical models Materials and Methods: We treated mice bearing subcutaneous tumor cell lines harboring EGFR mutation (PC-9, H3255) or ALK rearrangement (ABC-11, H3122) using combinations of anti-mouse VEGFR antibody DC101 and erlotinib (EGFR TKI) /alectinib (ALK TKI). Neovascularization of the tumors were determined by CD31 immunostaining. To determine the effects of VEGFR antibody on cancer cell itself, we also examined the efficacy of the combinations in vitro. Results: Combination therapy demonstrated significantly better tumor inhibition compared to erlotinib or alectinib alone in all the examined xenograft tumors. CD31 positive blood vessel staining was significantly reduced in the tumors treated with combination therapy. Mutant EGFR transfection in HEK293T cells increased VEGF expression in the cell culture supernatant. Furthermore, MTT assay showed significantly enhanced cell growth inhibition when anti-human VEGFR antibody ramucirumab combined with erlotinib (against PC-9 or H3255 cells) or alectinib (against ABC-11 or H3122 cells) suggesting that anti-VEGFR antibody affects not only on tumor vasculature but cancer cell itself. Consistent with this finding, combination with siVEGFR and erlotinib also inhibited the cell proliferation significantly better than erlotinib alone in PC-9 cells. Conclusion: A significant combination benefit was observed with anti-VEGFR2 antibody and EGFR or ALK TKI both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting anti-VEGFR antibody inhibits not only the blood vessels but may also exert direct anticancer effects. Combination therapy of erlotinib or alectinib and anti-VEGFR2 antibody could be a promising treatment strategy for oncogene addicted NSCLC.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of adding panitumumab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) vs bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) to standard first-line chemotherapy for treatment of RAS wild-type, left-sided, metastatic colorectal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial at 197 sites in Japan in May 2015–January 2022 among 823 patients with chemotherapy-naive RAS wild-type, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (final follow-up, January 14, 2022). INTERVENTIONS Panitumumab (n = 411) or bevacizumab (n = 412) plus modified fluorouracil, l-leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) every 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point, overall survival, was tested first in participants with left-sided tumors, then in the overall population. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, response rate, duration of response, and curative (defined as R0 status) resection rate. RESULTS In the as-treated population (n = 802; median age, 66 years; 282 [35.2\%] women), 604 (75.3\%) had left-sided tumors. Median follow-up was 61 months. Median overall survival was 37.9 months with panitumumab vs 34.3 months with bevacizumab in participants with left-sided tumors (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0.82; 95.798\% CI, 0.68-0.99; P = .03) and 36.2 vs 31.3 months, respectively, in the overall population (HR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.98; P = .03). Median progression-free survival for panitumumab vs bevacizumab was 13.1 vs 11.9 months, respectively, for those with left-sided tumors (HR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.20) and 12.2 vs 11.4 months overall (HR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.90-1.24). Response rates with panitumumab vs bevacizumab were 80.2\% vs 68.6\%, respectively, for left-sided tumors (difference, 11.2\%; 95\% CI, 4.4\%-17.9\%) and 74.9\% vs 67.3\% overall (difference, 7.7\%; 95\% CI, 1.5\%-13.8\%). Median duration of response with panitumumab vs bevacizumab was 13.1 vs 11.2 months for left-sided tumors (HR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.70-1.10) and 11.9 vs 10.7 months overall (HR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.74-1.06). Curative resection rates with panitumumab vs bevacizumab were 18.3\% vs 11.6\% for left-sided tumors; (difference, 6.6\%; 95\% CI, 1.0\%-12.3\%) and 16.5\% vs 10.9\% overall (difference, 5.6\%; 95\% CI, 1.0\%-10.3\%). Common treatment-emergent adverse events were acneiform rash (panitumumab: 74.8\%; bevacizumab: 3.2\%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (panitumumab: 70.8\%; bevacizumab: 73.7\%), and stomatitis (panitumumab: 61.6\%; bevacizumab: 40.5\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, adding panitumumab, compared with bevacizumab, to standard first-line chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in those with left-sided tumors and in the overall population.},

  abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is commonly upregulated in cancers such as in non-small-cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Various mechanisms mediate the upregulation of EGFR activity, including common mutations and truncations to its extracellular domain, such as in the EGFRvIII truncations, as well as to its kinase domain, such as the L858R and T790M mutations, or the exon 19 truncation. These EGFR aberrations over-activate downstream pro-oncogenic signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK and AKT-PI3K-mTOR pathways. These pathways then activate many biological outputs that are beneficial to cancer cell proliferation, including their chronic initiation and progression through the cell cycle. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms that regulate EGFR signal transduction, including the EGFR structure and its mutations, ligand binding and EGFR dimerization, as well as the signaling pathways that lead to G1 cell cycle progression. We focus on the induction of CYCLIN D expression, CDK4/6 activation, and the repression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins (CDKi) by EGFR signaling pathways. We also discuss the successes and challenges of EGFR-targeted therapies, and the potential for their use in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors.}

This study investigated retrospectively the benefits of local ablative therapy (LAT) to central nervous system (CNS) and/or limited systemic disease progression and continuation of crizotinib or erlotinib in patients with metastatic ALK gene rearrangement ( ALK+ ) or EGFR -mutant ( EGFR -MT) NSCLC, respectively. Methods: Patients with metastatic ALK + NSCLC treated with crizotinib ( n = 38) and EGFR -MT NSCLC treated with erlotinib ( n = 27) were identified at a single institution. Initial response to the respective kinase inhibitors, median progression-free survival (PFS1), and site of first progression were recorded. A subset of patients with either nonleptomeningeal CNS and/or four sites or fewer of extra-CNS progression (oligoprogressive disease) suitable for LAT received either radiation or surgery to these sites and continued on the same tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The subsequent median progression-free survival from the time of first progression (PFS2) and pattern of progression were recorded. Results: Median progression-free survival in ALK + patients on crizotinib was 9.0 months, and 13.8 months for EGFR -MT patients on erlotinib. Twenty-five of 51 patients (49\%) who progressed were deemed suitable for local therapy (15 ALK +, 10 EGFR -MT; 24 with radiotherapy, one with surgery) and continuation of the same targeted therapy. Post-LAT, 19 of 25 patients progressed again, with median PFS2 of 6.2 months.

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on genomic DNA has been widely applied for gene rearrangement detection in patients with NSCLC. However, intergenic-breakpoint fusions, in which one or both genomic breakpoints localize to intergenic regions, confound kinase fusion detection. We evaluated the function of intergenic-breakpoint fusions with multiplex molecular testing approaches. Methods NSCLCs with intergenic-breakpoint fusion identified by DNA-based NGS were analyzed by RNA-based NGS, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Results A total of 26 cases with single intergenic-breakpoint fusion were identified from a large cohort of NSCLCs using DNA-based NGS. Of the 26 cases, RNA-based NGS detected expressed fusion transcripts in 11 cases, but the genomic breakpoint position did not logically predict breakpoint of the fusion transcript in these cases, possibly owing to complex rearrangements (n = 5), alternative splicing (n = 2), and reciprocal rearrangement (n = 4). Nonetheless, no expressed fusion transcript was detected in five cases. Moreover, positive anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine (ALK) finding was observed in three of the remaining 10 cases with IHC but not with RNA-based NGS. Three patients with intergenic-breakpoint ALK fusion with or without RNA-based NGS or IHC confirmation who received crizotinib treatment were found to have partial responses. However, one patient with intergenic-breakpoint ROS1, given the positive fluorescence in situ hybridization result, received crizotinib but developed progressive disease within 1 month, possibly owing to no functional fusion transcript detected by RNA-based NGS. Conclusions Intergenic-breakpoint fusions detected by DNA sequencing confound kinase fusion detection in NSCLC, as functional fusion transcripts may be generated or not. Additional validation testing using RNA/protein assay should be performed in intergenic-breakpoint fusion cases to guide optimal treatment.}

However, little is known about the efficacy and safety of combining osimertinib with chemotherapy. Methods This was a retrospective study performed at 3 institutions. Patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC who received concurrent osimertinib with chemotherapy in the third-line or beyond were identified by chart review. Efficacy outcomes including duration on treatment (DOT), overall survival (OS), and CNS outcomes were assessed. Safety outcomes were also evaluated. Results A total of 44 patients met inclusion criteria. Median DOT with osimertinib plus platinum doublet (n = 28) was 6.1 months (95\% CI 4.1 months�忛ot reached), and with osimertinib plus single-agent chemotherapy (n = 29) was 2.6 months (95\% CI 1.8-4.8 months). Median OS from the start of osimertinib plus chemotherapy was 10.4 months (95\% CI 7.0-13.2 months). At initiation of osimertinib plus chemotherapy, 37 patients (84\%) had CNS metastases; 9 of these (24\%) had CNS disease progression on osimertinib plus chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was delayed or dose reduced due to toxicity in 8 patients (18\%); osimertinib was discontinued in 1 patient (2\%) for reduced cardiac ejection fraction, and dose reduced in 2 patients (5\%). Conclusions The combination of osimertinib plus chemotherapy appeared safe and showed favorable control of CNS disease in this cohort of patients who had progressed systemically with multiple prior lines of therapy, with DOT and survival outcomes similar to historical chemotherapy controls.}

Among the latter were members of the P2Y purinergic receptor family of G-protein-coupled receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y6). P2Y receptors mediated resistance in part through a protein-kinase-C (PKC)-dependent mechanism. Moreover, PKC activation alone was sufficient to confer resistance to ALK inhibitors, whereas combined ALK and PKC inhibition restored sensitivity. We observed enrichment of gene signatures associated with several resistance drivers (including P2Y receptors) in crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged lung tumors compared to treatment-naive controls, supporting a role for these identified mechanisms in clinical ALK inhibitor resistance.}

We report final efficacy and safety data, and exploratory molecular profiling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who received prior platinum-doublet chemotherapy and crizotinib were randomized 2~:~1 to receive alectinib 600 mg twice daily (n~= 79) or chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 or docetaxel 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks; n~= 40) until progressive disease, death or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints included ORR, CNS ORR and safety. Plasma samples were collected at baseline, then every 6 weeks until progressive disease; molecular factors detected by next-generation sequencing were correlated with outcomes. RESULTS: Investigator-assessed PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than chemotherapy (median 10.9 versus 1.4 months; hazard ratio 0.20, 95\% confidence interval 0.12-0.33; P {$<$} 0.001). ORR was 50.6\% with alectinib versus 2.5\% with chemotherapy (P {$<$} 0.001). In patients with measurable CNS metastases at baseline, CNS ORR was 66.7\% with alectinib versus 0\% with chemotherapy (P {$<$} 0.001). No new safety signals were seen. ALK rearrangement was identified in 69.5\% (n~= 41/59) of baseline plasma samples. Confirmed partial responses were observed with alectinib in 6/11 patients with a secondary ALK mutation and 4/6 patients with a non-EML4-ALK (where EML4 is echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) fusion. Detection of mutant TP53 in baseline plasma resulted in numerically shorter PFS with alectinib (hazard ratio 1.88, 95\% confidence interval 0.9-3.93). CONCLUSIONS: Final efficacy data from ALUR confirmed the superior PFS, ORR and CNS ORR of alectinib versus chemotherapy in pretreated, advanced ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Alectinib prolonged PFS versus chemotherapy in patients with wild-type or mutant TP53; however, alectinib activity was considerably decreased in patients with mutant TP53.},

The most common EGFR-activating mutations, the exon 19 deletion and the L858R point mutation occurring in the receptor tyrosine kinase domain, are susceptible to inhibition. The first EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to be evaluated were the reversible first-generation EGFR TKIs, gefitinib and erlotinib, followed by the irreversible second-generation EGFR TKIs, afatinib and dacomitinib. The study of acquired resistance mechanisms to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs in patients with activating EGFR-mutated NSCLC identified the gatekeeper T790M point mutation, present in over 50\% of cases, as the most common mechanism of acquired resistance. The need to overcome this resistance mechanism led to the development of third-generation EGFR TKIs, of which osimertinib is the only one to date with regulatory approval. In this review, we present the clinical context leading to the development of third-generation EGFR TKIs, the mode of action of these inhibitors and the clinical data supporting their use. We review third-generation TKI agents that are approved, in development, and those that failed in clinical trials. Finally, we will touch upon ongoing studies and future directions, such as combination treatment strategies, currently being explored to improve the efficacy of treatment with third-generation EGFR TKIs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Responses to EGFR-targeted therapy are generally temporary, due to inevitable drug resistance. The prevalence and characteristics of receptor tyrosine-kinase (RTK) fusion as acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are rarely investigated. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed genomic profiling data of 3873 EGFR (exons 18-21)-mutant lung cancer patients with more than once next-generation sequencing detection. A total of 16 patients who acquired RTK fusions during EGFR-TKI treatment with paired pre- and post-EGFR-TKI samples were identified. Their treatment history was collected. Results: Newly acquired RTK fusions during EGFR-TKI treatment included RET (n=6, 37.5\%), ALK (n=5, 31.3\%), NTRK1 (n=4, 25.0\%), ROS1 (n=1, 6.3\%), and FGFR3 (n=1, 6.3\%). All RET and EML4-ALK fusions were uncommon variants of KIF5B-RET and E2:A20 (V5), respectively. Interestingly, RET fusion occurred only after osimertinib treatment, and contributed to drug resistance in 50\% (6 of 12) of patients treated with osimertinib, indicating that fusions had different prevalence when functioning as resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs. Moreover, we found that in all patients developing drug resistance to EGFR TKIs due to fusion emergence (n=16), those that had a treatment history of third-generation EGFR TKIs accounted for 75\% (n=12). Conclusion: We have extended the current knowledge of resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs in non-small-cell lung cancer. Detection of RTK fusions should be included in genomic profiling panels to uncover potential resistance mechanisms of EGFR TKIs, which might inform therapeutic strategies, such as combination-therapy approaches, to circumvent tumorigenesis.},

More than 19 different ALK fusion partners have been discovered in NSCLC, including EML4, KIF5B, KLC1, and TPR. Most of these ALK fusions in NSCLC patients respond well to the ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. In this paper, we reviewed fusion partner genes with ALK, detection methods for ALK-rearrangement (ALK-R), and the ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, used in NSCLC patients.}

  abstract = {Purpose: The third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib is approved to treat patients with EGFR T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have developed resistance to earlier-generation drugs. Acquired EGFR C797S mutation has been reported to mediate osimertinib resistance in some patients. However, the remaining resistance mechanisms are largely unknown.Experimental Design: We performed mutation profiling using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) for 416 cancer-relevant genes on 93 osimertinib-resistant lung cancer patients' samples, mainly cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs), and matched pretreatment samples of 12 patients. In vitro experiments were conducted to functionally study the secondary EGFR mutations identified.Results:EGFR G796/C797, L792, and L718/G719 mutations were identified in 24.7\%, 10.8\%, and 9.7\% of the cases, respectively, with certain mutations coexisting in one patient with different prevalence. L792 and L718 mutants markedly increased the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of osimertinib in vitro, among which the L718Q mutation conferred the greatest resistance to osimertinib, as well as gefitinib resistance when not coexisting with T790M. Further analysis of the 12 matched pretreatment samples confirmed that these EGFR mutations were acquired during osimertinib treatment. Alterations in parallel or downstream oncogenes such as MET, KRAS, and PIK3CA were also discovered, potentially contributing to the osimertinib-resistance in patients without EGFR secondary mutations.Conclusions: We present comprehensive mutation profiles of a large cohort of osimertinib-resistance lung cancer patients using mainly cfDNA. Besides C797 mutations, novel secondary mutations of EGFR L718 and L792 residues confer osimertinib resistance, both in vitro and in vivo, and are of great clinical and pharmaceutical relevance.

The feasibility of combining erlotinib or gefitinib with the anti�𢖯rogrammed death 1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab was evaluated in the phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-021 study (NCT02039674). Methods Adults with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks plus oral erlotinib 150 mg daily in cohort E or oral gefitinib 250 mg daily in cohort F, using a 3 + 3 design with cohort expansion. rTumor response was evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by blinded independent central review. The primary objective was determination of a recommended phase 2 dose. Results Twelve patients enrolled to receive pembrolizumab plus erlotinib and seven to receive pembrolizumab plus gefitinib. No dose-limiting toxicities or grade 5 events occurred. Pembrolizumab plus erlotinib was feasible, with adverse events similar to those expected for monotherapy. However, pembrolizumab plus gefitinib was not feasible due to grade 3/4 liver toxicity in five of seven patients (71.4\%), leading to permanent treatment discontinuation in four patients. The most frequently occurring treatment-related adverse events with pembrolizumab plus erlotinib were rash (50.0\%), dermatitis acneiform, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, and pruritus (33.3\% each). The objective response rate was 41.7\%, including response in all four patients with programmed death ligand 1 expression 50\% or greater. Conclusions Although pembrolizumab plus gefitinib was not feasible, the toxicity profile observed with pembrolizumab plus erlotinib suggests combining immunotherapy with anti-EGFR therapy is feasible. Pembrolizumab plus erlotinib did not improve objective response rate compared with previous monotherapy studies; further evaluation would be necessary to evaluate potential effects on other efficacy outcomes.}

  abstract = {Introduction: This open-label, phase 3 trial (ALTA-3; NCT03596866) compared efficacy and safety of brigatinib versus alectinib for ALKþ NSCLC after disease progression on crizotinib. Methods: Patients with advanced ALKþ NSCLC that progressed on crizotinib were randomized 1:1 to brigatinib 180 mg once daily (7-d lead-in, 90 mg) or alectinib 600 mg twice daily, aiming to test superiority. The primary end point was blinded independent review committee–assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Interim analysis for efficacy and futility was planned at approximately 70\% of 164 expected PFS events. Results: The population (N ¼ 248; brigatinib, n ¼ 125; alectinib, n ¼ 123) was notable for long median duration of prior crizotinib (16.0–16.8 mo) and low rate of ALK fusion in baseline circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA; 78 of 232 [34\%]). Median blinded independent review committee–assessed PFS was 19.3 months with brigatinib and 19.2 months with alectinib (hazard ratio ¼ 0.97 [95\% confidence interval: 0.66–1.42], p ¼ 0.8672]). The study met futility criterion. Overall survival was immature (41 events [17\%]). Exploratory analyses pooled across the treatment groups revealed median PFS of 11.1 versus 22.5 months in patients with versus without ctDNA-detectable ALK fusion at baseline (hazard ratio: 0.48 [95\% confidence interval: 0.32–0.71]). Treatmentrelated adverse events in more than 30\% of patients (brigatinib, alectinib) were elevated levels of blood creatine phosphokinase (70\%, 29\%), aspartate aminotransferase (53\%, 38\%), and alanine aminotransferase (40\%, 36\%). Conclusions: Brigatinib was not superior to alectinib for PFS in crizotinib-pretreated ALKþ NSCLC. Safety was consistent with the well-established and unique profiles of each drug. The low proportion of patients with ctDNAdetectable ALK fusion may account for prolonged PFS with both drugs in ALTA-3.},

  abstract = {The cornerstone of treatment for advanced ALK-positive lung cancer is sequential therapy with increasingly potent and selective ALK inhibitors. The third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib has demonstrated clinical activity in patients who failed previous ALK inhibitors. To define the spectrum of ALK mutations that confer lorlatinib resistance, we performed accelerated mutagenesis screening of Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK. Under comparable conditions, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis generated numerous crizotinib-resistant but no lorlatinib-resistant clones harboring single ALK mutations. In similar screens with EML4-ALK containing single ALK resistance mutations, numerous lorlatinib-resistant clones emerged harboring compound ALK mutations. To determine the clinical relevance of these mutations, we analyzed repeat biopsies from lorlatinib-resistant patients. Seven of 20 samples (35\%) harbored compound ALK mutations, including two identified in the ENU screen. Whole-exome sequencing in three cases confirmed the stepwise accumulation of ALK mutations during sequential treatment. These results suggest that sequential ALK inhibitors can foster the emergence of compound ALK mutations, identification of which is critical to informing drug design and developing effective therapeutic strategies.Significance: Treatment with sequential first-, second-, and third-generation ALK inhibitors can select for compound ALK mutations that confer high-level resistance to ALK-targeted therapies. A more efficacious long-term strategy may be up-front treatment with a third-generation ALK inhibitor to prevent the emergence of on-target resistance.

This class of anticancer therapeutics, termed immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has harnessed the potential of the body's own immune system to recognize cancerous cells and selectively eliminate them, in some cases with alarming success. This new breakthrough, however, has not been without its drawbacks. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are adverse events encountered during treatment with ICIs that are thought to be mediated through the patient's immune system which can manifest with a variety of symptoms which often resemble autoimmunity. These events range widely in presentation and severity and are reported frequently. Here, we will discuss a large selection of case reports in order to inform the clinician, laboratorian, and researcher of the scope of organ systems affected, the severity of the conditions being encountered, and the responses of these events to treatment, as well as explore the use of ICIs in the setting of preexisting autoimmunity. We will also consider the ability to detect autoantibodies before and during irAEs as well as the correlations that irAEs have with clinical outcomes. Finally, we will conclude by exploring the possibility that two distinct pathways may be contributing to the phenomenon of irAEs within this class of drugs, and the role that this might play in future research and clinical practice.},

Methods: Patients with NSCLC were examined for EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations by fragment analysis and for EGFR L858R point mutations by the Cycleave polymerase chain reaction technique. EGFR mutation-positive patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent/refractory NSCLC that was not curable with surgery or thoracic radiotherapy were candidates for gefitinib treatment administered at 250 mg/day until disease progression. Results: Mutations of the EGFR gene were detected in 27 (41\%) of 66 patients. Ten had exon 19 deletion, and 17 had L858R. Twenty-one patients harboring EGFR mutations were treated with gefitinib and were considered assessable for responses and adverse events. Nineteen patients with EGFR mutations achieved objective responses (three complete responses and 16 partial responses), resulting in an overall response rate of 90.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 69.6\%��98.8\%). The median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (95\% confidence interval, 6.0 mo to not reached). The median overall survival has not been reached. Common adverse events were skin toxicity, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferases, but no pulmonary toxicity was observed. Conclusions: Detection of common EGFR mutations seems to be useful for selecting patients with NSCLC who would likely benefit from gefitinib monotherapy.}

  abstract = {EGFR-mutant lung cancers represent a paradigm for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to treat molecular subsets of cancer, with randomized trials demonstrating the efficacy of first-generation, reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs. However, acquired resistance invariably develops, and rebiopsy of patients with clinical progression has elucidated EGFR T790M mutation as the major resistance mechanism.1 To address this clinical challenge, third-generation pyrimidine-based EGFR TKIs have been designed to have selectivity for EGFR T790M over wild-type EGFR.2 They form a covalent bond with cysteine 797 in the adenosine triphosphate�弎inding cleft. Early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy in patients with double-mutant tumors (EGFR L858R/T790M and ex19del/T790M) and acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors.3 Specificity for EGFR T790M may be the result of hydrophobic interactions between the bulky methionine moiety of EGFR T790M and these pyrimidine-based drugs. Mechanisms of resistance to these third-generation EGFR TKIs have been identified in preclinical in vitro models, but none have so far been identified in patients. Mutations at the EGFR C797 codon, located within the kinase-binding site, are a predicted resistance mechanism to irreversible EGFR inhibitors also confirmed in vitro.4 Loss of the potential for covalent bond formation at position 797 by the missense mutation C797S results in a markedly reduced cellular potency of this class of TKIs.5 Interestingly, an analogous cysteine-to-serine mutation is a mechanism of resistance to the irreversible Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.6}

Smaller series have identified various mechanisms of resistance, but systematic evaluation of a large number of patients to definitively establish the frequency of various mechanisms has not been conducted. Experimental Design: Patients with lung adenocarcinomas and acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib enrolled onto a prospective biopsy protocol and underwent a rebiopsy after the development of acquired resistance. Histology was reviewed. Samples underwent genotyping for mutations in EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, NRAS and PIK3CA , and FISH for MET and HER2 . Results: Adequate tumor samples for molecular analysis were obtained in 155 patients. Ninety-eight had second-site EGFR T790M mutations [63\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 55\%��70\%] and four had small cell transformation (3\%, 95\% CI, 0\%��6\%).

We did not detect any acquired mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1 , or NRAS (0 of 88, 0\%; 95\% CI, 0\%��4\%). Overlap among mechanisms of acquired resistance was seen in 4\%. Conclusions: This is the largest series reporting mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy. We identified EGFR T790M as the most common mechanism of acquired resistance, whereas MET amplification, HER2 amplification, and small cell histologic transformation occur less frequently. More comprehensive methods to characterize molecular alterations in this setting are needed to improve our understanding of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.

  abstract = {9007             Background: EGFR ins20-mutant NSCLC has historically been challenging to treat. While new agents targeting EGFR ins20 have recently been approved, adverse events (AEs), particularly wild type (WT) EGFR-related AEs are common. CLN-081 is a novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with broad activity against EGFR mutations, including ins20, and increased selectivity for ins20 versus WT EGFR. CLN-081 has been granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of pts with EGFR ins20 NSCLC. We present updated results of the initial multicenter Ph1/2a study of CLN-081 in pts with advanced, EGFR ins20-mutant NSCLC, including 39 pts treated in an expanded cohort at the dose of 100 mg twice daily (BID). Methods: Ph1 dose escalation utilized an accelerated titration (AT) and rolling six design. Individual cohorts were expanded in Phase 1 and 2a based on prespecified protocol criteria. Pts were required to have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Stable, treated brain metastasis (mets) were allowed. CLN-081 is dosed in 21-day cycles. Results: As of 13 December 2021, 73 pts [median age: 65 (36-82), median lines of prior therapy: 2 (1-9), 28 (39\%) with a history of brain mets] received CLN-081 at 30 mg (8), 45 mg (1), 65 mg (14), 100 mg (39), and 150 mg (11), all BID. Treatment-related AEs in ≥ 15\% of pts were rash (74\%), diarrhea (27\%), paronychia (25\%), fatigue (19\%), anemia (18\%), dry skin (18\%), nausea (16\%). Treatment-related Gr ≥ 3 AEs in ≥ 4 \% of pts included anemia (10\%), increased ALT (4\%), and increased AST (4\%). Gr 3 rash and Gr 3 diarrhea were observed in 1 and 2 pts, respectively, at 150 mg BID, while no pts treated at ≤ 100 mg BID experienced Gr 3 rash or diarrhea. Treatment-related dose reductions and discontinuations across all dose levels occurred in 10 pts (14\%) and 5 pts (7\%) respectively. Among 70 response-evaluable pts across all dose levels, 25 (36\%) had a confirmed partial response (PR), 34 (49\%) had stable disease (SD), and 3 (4\%) had progressive disease as a best response. Seven pts (10\%) had a PR that remained unconfirmed; 1 (1\%) pt was pending a confirmatory scan. Of 36 response-evaluable pts at 100 mg BID, 14 (39\%) had a confirmed PR, 17 (47\%) had SD, and 1 (3\%) had PD. Three pts had a PR that remained unconfirmed (8\%); 1 (3\%) pt was pending a confirmatory scan. Notably, among Ph1 pts treated at 100 mg BID (N = 13) in whom longer follow-up is available, the mDOR and mPFS (estimated by Kaplan-Meier) was {$>$} 15 months and 12 months, respectively. Disease control (SD ≥ 6 months or any PR) was observed in 12/13 pts (92\%). Updated data with additional follow-up will be presented. Conclusions: In pts with heavily-pretreated advanced EGFR ins20 NSCLC, CLN-081 has a manageable safety profile, with anti-tumor activity across the range of doses tested. Further, CLN-081 has demonstrated a favorable clinical profile at the dose of 100 mg BID, with an encouraging objective response rate, response durability, and no Gr 3 rash or diarrhea.

  abstract = {The promising results of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors have changed the significance of ALK fusions in several types of cancer. These fusions are no longer mere research targets or diagnostic markers, but they are now directly linked to the therapeutic benefit of patients. However, most available tumor tissues in clinical settings are formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE), and this significantly limits detailed genetic studies in many clinical cases. Although recent technical improvements have allowed the analysis of some known mutations in FFPE tissues, identifying unknown fusion genes by using only FFPE tissues remains difficult. We developed a 5��-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-based system optimized for FFPE tissues and evaluated this system on a lung cancer tissue with ALK rearrangement and without the 2 known ALK fusions EML4-ALK and KIF5B-ALK. With this system, we successfully identified a novel ALK fusion, KLC1-ALK. The result was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Then, we synthesized the putative full-length cDNA of KLC1-ALK and demonstrated the transforming potential of the fusion kinase with assays using mouse 3T3 cells. To the best of our knowledge, KLC1-ALK is the first novel oncogenic fusion identified using only FFPE tissues. This finding will broaden the potential value of archival FFPE tissues and provide further biological and clinical insights into ALK-positive lung cancer.}

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely used in clinics, but DNA-based NGS used to detect fusion genes has delivered false-negative results. However, fusion genes can be successfully detected at the transcription level and with higher sensitivity using RNA-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This study compared the performance of RT-PCR and NGS in the detection of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion in Chinese patients with NSCLC. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 153 patients who were pathologically diagnosed as having NSCLC were collected from November 2017 to October 2019. Both DNA/RNA-based NGS and RNA-based RT-PCR were used to detect EML4-ALK fusion. For samples with discordant ALK status results, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or Sanger sequencing was used to further confirm the ALK status. In total, 124 samples were successfully analyzed using both NGS and RT-PCR. For 118 samples, results were consistent between NGS and RT-PCR, with 25 reported as ALK fusion positive and 93 as ALK fusion negative, achieving a concordance rate of 95.16\%. Among the six samples with disconcordant results, five were positive using RT-PCR but negative using NGS, and one was positive using NGS but negative using RT-PCR. Four of six cases with disconcordant results (three RT-PCR positive and one NGS positive) were successfully validated using either FISH or Sanger sequencing. Compared with NGS, RT-PCR appears to be a reliable method of detecting EML4-ALK fusion in patients with NSCLC.}

  abstract = {Lung cancers caused by activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are initially responsive to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the efficacy of these agents is often limited because of the emergence of drug resistance conferred by a second mutation, T790M. Threonine 790 is the "gatekeeper" residue, an important determinant of inhibitor specificity in the ATP binding pocket. The T790M mutation has been thought to cause resistance by sterically blocking binding of TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib, but this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that it remains sensitive to structurally similar irreversible inhibitors. Here, we show by using a direct binding assay that T790M mutants retain low-nanomolar affinity for gefitinib. Furthermore, we show that the T790M mutation activates WT EGFR and that introduction of the T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the oncogenic L858R mutant by more than an order of magnitude. The increased ATP affinity is the primary mechanism by which the T790M mutation confers drug resistance. Crystallographic analysis of the T790M mutant shows how it can adapt to accommodate tight binding of diverse inhibitors, including the irreversible inhibitor HKI-272, and also suggests a structural mechanism for catalytic activation. We conclude that the T790M mutation is a "generic" resistance mutation that will reduce the potency of any ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and that irreversible inhibitors overcome this resistance simply through covalent binding, not as a result of an alternative binding mode.}

Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372), a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR-MET, has shown preclinical activity in TKI-sensitive EGFR-mutated NSCLC models and in an ongoing first-in-human study in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the activity of amivantamab in Exon20ins-driven tumors has not yet been described. Ba/F3 cells and patient-derived cells/organoids/xenograft models harboring diverse Exon20ins were used to characterize the antitumor mechanism of amivantamab. Amivantamab inhibited proliferation by effectively downmodulating EGFR-MET levels and inducing immune-directed antitumor activity with increased IFNγ secretion in various models. Importantly, in vivo efficacy of amivantamab was superior to cetuximab or poziotinib, an experimental Exon20ins-targeted TKI. Amivantamab produced robust tumor responses in two Exon20ins patients, highlighting the important translational nature of this preclinical work. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the activity of amivantamab and support its continued clinical development in Exon20ins patients, an area of high unmet medical need. SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies for EGFR Exon20ins-driven NSCLC. Preclinical data shown here, together with promising clinical activity in an ongoing phase I study, strongly support further clinical investigation of amivantamab in EGFR Exon20ins-driven NSCLC.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1079.}

  abstract = {Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and lacks HER2 overexpression or gene amplification. It accounts for 10–15\% of incident breast cancers and carries the worst prognosis. TNBC is overrepresented among Black and pre-menopausal women and is associated with significant psychological and treatment-related burdens, including financial toxicity. Like other breast cancers, TNBC is biologically heterogeneous, leading to diverse clinical and epidemiological behaviors, however, unlike the other clinical subtypes, in TNBC we still lack tumor-specific targeted therapy. Early TNBC outcomes have improved due to the intensification of therapies, including improvements in polychemotherapy and the addition of immunotherapy. Future efforts are needed to identify targetable aberrations for specific drug therapy, prevent immune evasion, and increase social-economic support. Given that the name TNBC illustrates its lack of specifically targeted and effective therapy, we look forward to being able to retire the name in favor of a group of targetable entities within what is now called “TNBC”.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anthracyclines and taxanes are chemotherapeutic agents widely used in a sequential regimen in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of early breast cancer to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Standard practice is to administer anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by a taxane. Anthracyclines tend to be administered first as they were established before taxanes for treatment of early breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the sequence in which anthracyclines and taxanes are administered affects outcomes for people with early breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 February 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing administering a taxane prior to an anthracycline with taxane following anthracycline to people with early breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. The studies needed to have reported on at least one of our outcomes of interest, which included overall survival, disease-free survival, pathological response, treatment adherence, toxicity and quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was overall survival. Secondary outcomes included disease-free survival, pathological response (in the neoadjuvant setting only), adverse events, treatment adherence and quality of life. For time-to-event outcomes of overall survival and disease-free survival, we derived hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) where possible. For dichotomous outcomes of pathological complete response, treatment adherence and adverse events, we reported the treatment effect as a risk ratio (RR) with 95\% CI where possible. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence separately for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. MAIN RESULTS: There were 1415 participants in five neoadjuvant studies and 280 participants in four adjuvant studies involving five treatment comparisons. Four of the five neoadjuvant studies collected data for the primary outcome (overall survival) and two studies had data available; one of the four adjuvant studies collected overall survival data.The neoadjuvant studies suggested that the administration of taxanes first probably resulted in little to no difference in overall survival (HR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.60 to 1.08; 947 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 828 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). Administration of taxanes first also resulted in little to no difference in pathological complete response (absence of cancer in the breast and axilla: RR 1.15, 95\% CI 0.96 to 1.38; 1280 participants; 4 studies; high-certainty evidence). However, there appeared to be a trend in favour of taxanes first. Studies reported treatment adherence using a range of measures. Administration of taxanes first probably did not increase the likelihood of requiring dose reductions compared to administration of anthracyclines first (RR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.59 to 1.11; 280 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably little to no difference in the risk of grade 3/4 neutropenia (RR 1.25, 95\% CI 0.86 to 1.82; 280 participants, 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) or grade 3/4 neurotoxicity (RR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.55 to 1.65; 1108 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence) when taxanes were given first. There were no data on quality of life.Only one adjuvant study collected data on overall survival and disease-free survival but did not report data. Administration of taxanes first reduced the risk of grade 3/4 neutropenia (RR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.40 to 0.97; 279 participants; 4 studies, 5 treatment comparisons; high-certainty evidence) and appeared to result in little to no difference in grade 3/4 neurotoxicity (RR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.25 to 2.46; 162 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). There was probably little to no difference in the proportions experiencing dose delays when taxanes are given first compared to anthracyclines given first (RR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.52 to 1.12; 238 participants; 3 studies, 4 treatment comparisons; moderate-certainty evidence). One study reported on quality of life and indicated that scores (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast Cancer (FACT-B) validated questionnaire) were similar in both groups though did not provide numerical data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the neoadjuvant setting, there is high- to low-certainty evidence of equivalent outcomes for the sequence in which taxanes are delivered. In the adjuvant setting, none of the studies reported on overall survival or disease-free survival. In most institutions, standard practice would be to deliver anthracycline followed by taxane, and currently available data do not support a change in this practice. We wait for the full-text publication of a relevant neoadjuvant study for women with HER2-negative breast cancer for inclusion in an update of this review.},

Trop-2 is an ideal candidate for targeted therapeutics due to it being a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain overexpressed on a wide variety of tumors as well as its upregulated expression relative to normal cells. As a result, several Trop-2-targeted therapeutics have recently been developed for clinical use, such as anti-Trop-2 antibodies and Trop-2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Subsequently, multiple early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated safety and clinical benefit of Trop-2-based ADCs across multiple tumor types. This includes clinical benefit and tolerability in tumor types with limited treatment options, such as triple-negative breast cancer, platinum-resistant urothelial cancer, and small-cell lung cancer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The authors' previous study demonstrated that the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (Bcl-2)-like 11 (BCL2L11) (Bim) deletion polymorphism was associated with poor clinical response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with non�𦽳mall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of the Bim deletion polymorphism among patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive or ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1)-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib. METHODS A total of 55 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and 14 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib were enrolled into the current study. The Bim deletion polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The clinical features of the Bim deletion polymorphism and its impact on the effect of crizotinib were investigated. RESULTS The Bim deletion polymorphism was present in 9 of 69 patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC (13.0\%). There were no differences noted with regard to clinicopathological features between patients with and without the Bim deletion polymorphism. Patients with the Bim deletion polymorphism had a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and lower objective response rate compared with those without (median PFS, 182 days vs 377 days [P = .008]) (objective response rate, 44.4\% vs 81.7\% [P =.041]) in all populations. The significant difference in PFS was observed in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC (83 days vs 305 days [P =.0304]) compared with those with ROS1-positive NSCLC (218 days vs not reached [P =.082]). Multivariate analysis indicated that the Bim deletion polymorphism was an independent predictive factor for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib (hazard ratio, 4.786 [P =.006]). CONCLUSIONS The Bim deletion polymorphism was found to be associated with poor clinical response to crizotinib in patients with ALK fusion-positive NSCLC.

  abstract = {Background T790M mutation is well known as the most common mechanism for resistance to the first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for EGFR mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer. Several third-generation EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib, have been explored and approved for conquering this resistance; however, acquired resistance to osimertinib is evident and the resistance mechanisms remain complex and incompletely explored. Case presentation A non-smoking 58-year-old female patient was initially diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion and clinically responded to initial gefitinib treatment. The patient progressed on gefitinib after {$>$}1 year and a T790M mutation was detected in tissue biopsy by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Osimertinib treatment was administrated for several months and an acquired rare EGFR G724S mutation was detected via NGS blood sample after osimertinib resistance. Conclusion The specific mechanisms of acquiring drug resistance for EGFR-TKIs have not been fully explored. EGFR G724S mutation might be associated with osimertinib resistance but more studies about the mechanism should be explored.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Non�𦽳mall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring ALK gene rearrangements (ALK+) typically become resistant to the first-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib through development of secondary resistance mutations in ALK or disease progression in the brain. Mutations that confer resistance to second-generation ALK TKIs ceritinib and alectinib have also been identified. Here, we report the structure and first comprehensive preclinical evaluation of the next-generation ALK TKI brigatinib. Experimental Design: A kinase screen was performed to evaluate the selectivity profile of brigatinib. The cellular and in vivo activities of ALK TKIs were compared using engineered and cancer-derived cell lines. The brigatinib�𨯗LK co-structure was determined. Results: Brigatinib potently inhibits ALK and ROS1, with a high degree of selectivity over more than 250 kinases. Across a panel of ALK+ cell lines, brigatinib inhibited native ALK (IC50, 10 nmol/L) with 12-fold greater potency than crizotinib. Superior efficacy of brigatinib was also observed in mice with ALK+ tumors implanted subcutaneously or intracranially. Brigatinib maintained substantial activity against all 17 secondary ALK mutants tested in cellular assays and exhibited a superior inhibitory profile compared with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib at clinically achievable concentrations. Brigatinib was the only TKI to maintain substantial activity against the most recalcitrant ALK resistance mutation, G1202R. The unique, potent, and pan-ALK mutant activity of brigatinib could be rationalized by structural analyses. Conclusions: Brigatinib is a highly potent and selective ALK inhibitor. These findings provide the molecular basis for the promising activity being observed in ALK+, crizotinib-resistant patients with NSCLC being treated with brigatinib in clinical trials.

However, the use of osimertinib may result in the development of further resistance, most commonly via the cis-C797S mutation. Herein, we report a case of a lung cancer patient harboring triple EGFR mutations of L858R, T790M, and cis-C797S who was treated with a combination of osimertinib, bevacizumab, and brigatinib. The above 3 mutations were detected by circulating tumor DNA analysis after osimertinib treatment. Subsequently, the patient received combination therapy of osimertinib and bevacizumab; the partial relief obtained was negated by later disease progression. The regimen was then changed to osimertinib, bevacizumab, and brigatinib combination therapy. Partial remission was observed, and a significant reduction in EGFR mutations was detected. This case represents the first evidence that 1) bevacizumab combined with osimertinib can significantly relieve tumor growth and respiratory symptoms in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with osimertinib resistance and 2) the clinical use of osimertinib, bevacizumab, and brigatinib is effective as combination therapy for pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the presence of triple EGFR mutations of L858R, T790M, and cis-C797S. These combination therapies may provide potential novel treatment options for pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients.},

Despite impressive initial tumor responses, development of drug resistance ultimately limits the benefit of this compound. Mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib are just beginning to emerge, such as EGFR C797S and L718Q mutations, BRAF V600E and PIK3CA E545K mutations, as well as ERBB2 and MET amplification. However, a comprehensive view is still missing. In this study, we presented the first case of Chinese NSCLC patient who developed resistance to osimertinib, and discovered de novo EGFR G796D mutation as a potential mechanism. Our findings provided insights into mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib and highlighted tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution during the development of drug resistance.}

According to updated ALK testing guidelines from the College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Association for Molecular Pathology published in 2018, ALK immunohistochemistry is formally an alternative to ALK FISH, and simultaneous detection of multiple hot spots, including, at least, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET, ERBB2, BRAF and KRAS genes is also recommended while performing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing. Therefore, ALK status in a specimen can be tested by different methods and platforms, even in the same institution or laboratory. In this review, we discuss several clinically relevant technical aspects of ALK FISH, including pros and cons of the unique two-step (50- to 100-cell) analysis approach employed in the Vysis Break Apart ALK FISH assay, including: the preset cutoff value of ��15\% for a positive result; technical aspects and biology of discordant results obtained by different methods; and incidental findings, such as ALK copy number gain or amplification and co-existent driver mutations.

Methods Patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC harbouring EGFR-mutation were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive either combination with erlotinib (150 mg daily) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg iv q3w) or erlotinib (150 mg daily). Random assignment was stratified by sex (female/male), disease stage (stage IIIb vs. stage IV vs. recurrence), and EGFR gene mutation (exon 19 deletion vs. exon 21 L858R). The primary endpoint was Progression-free survival (PFS), as determined by an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints were PFS by investigator, tumor response (by IRC and investigator), overall survival (OS), time to failure (TTF), safety, patient-reported outcome (PRO) and exploratory biomarker analysis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a 448-gene panel and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used for resistance biomarker analysis of paired frozen tissue samples. Results From Mar 31, 2016 to Jul 26, 2017, 311 patients from 14 centers across China were randomized to receive BE (N = 157) or E (N = 154). Median follow-up time was 22 months for BE and 21.5 months for E. Baseline characteristics were well balanced in each arm. The median PFS by IRC was 18.0 months (95\% CI 15.2-20.7) in BE and 11.3 months (95\%CI 9.8-13.8) in E (p Conclusions As compared with E alone, B plus E showed superior efficacy with acceptable tolerability.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK-positive) disease occurs in approximately 5\% of all patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, with a similar incidence reported in Asian patients. This study is the first phase 3 randomised trial recruiting only Asian patients to compare alectinib with crizotinib as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with 600 mg of alectinib twice per day. This study assessed consistency of the progression-free survival benefit with the global phase 3 ALEX study. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 21 investigational sites in China, South Korea, and Thailand, Asian patients, aged 18 years or older, with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) to twice-daily oral alectinib (600 mg) or crizotinib (250 mg). Patients were randomly assigned via a block-stratified (block size three) randomisation procedure, done centrally via an interactive voice or web response system, with stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and baseline CNS metastases. Clinical staff and the funder's drug safety and medical monitoring staff had access to treatment assignments. The independent review committee was masked to treatment assignment, and funder personnel did not have access to efficacy and safety summaries by treatment group, before the formal reporting of study results. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were permitted. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The primary analysis population for efficacy was the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomly assigned patients. The primary analysis population for safety was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02838420. FINDINGS: Between Aug 3, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 187 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 125 to alectinib and 62 to crizotinib. Median follow-up was 16·2 months (IQR 13·7-17·6) in the alectinib group, and 15·0 months (12·5-17·3) in the crizotinib group. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with alectinib versus crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22, 95\% CI 0·13-0·38; p{$<$}0·0001; median progression-free survival not estimable vs 11·1 months). Independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the alectinib group compared with the crizotinib group (HR 0·37, 0·22-0·61; p{$<$}0·0001). The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 114 (91\%) of 125 with alectinib, and 48 (77\%) of 62 with crizotinib, with a longer duration of response for alectinib than crizotinib (HR 0·22, 95\% CI 0·12-0·40; p{$<$}0·0001). Time to CNS progression (cause-specific HR 0·14) and the percentage of patients who achieved a CNS objective response with measurable or non-measurable baseline CNS lesions were improved (32 [73\%] of 44 patients treated with alectinib vs five [22\%] of 23 patients treated with crizotinib). Despite longer treatment duration with alectinib than crizotinib (14·7 months vs 12·6 months, respectively), fewer patients had grade 3-5 adverse events (36 [29\%] of 125 vs 30 [48\%] of 62, respectively) or serious adverse events (19 [15\%] of 125 vs 16 [26\%] of 62, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Our results align with ALEX, confirming the clinical benefit of 600 mg of alectinib twice per day as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate treatment outcomes and safety of mobocertinib in patients with previously treated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 3-part, open-label, phase 1/2 nonrandomized clinical trial with dose-escalation/dose-expansion cohorts (28 sites in the US) and a single-arm extension cohort (EXCLAIM; 39 sites in Asia, Europe, and North America) was conducted between June 2016 and November 2020 (data cutoff date). The primary analysis populations were the platinum-pretreated patients (PPP) cohort and the EXCLAIM cohort. The PPP cohort included 114 patients with platinum-pretreated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC who received mobocertinib 160 mg once daily from the dose-escalation (n = 6), dose-expansion (n = 22), and EXCLAIM (n = 86) cohorts. The EXCLAIM cohort included 96 patients with previously treated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC (10 were not platinum pretreated and thus were excluded from the PPP cohort). INTERVENTIONS Mobocertinib 160 mg once daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point of the PPP and EXCLAIM cohorts was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent review committee (IRC). Secondary end points included confirmed ORR by investigator, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS Among the PPP (n = 114) and EXCLAIM (n = 96) cohorts, the median (range) age was 60 (27-84) and 59 (27-80) years, respectively; most patients were women (75 [66\%] and 62 [65\%], respectively) and of Asian race (68 [60\%] and 66 [69\%], respectively). At data cutoff, median follow-up was 14.2 months in the PPP cohort (median 2 prior anticancer regimens; 40 [35\%] had baseline brain metastases), with confirmed ORR of 28\% (95\% CI, 20\%-37\%) by IRC assessment and 35\% (95\% CI, 26\%-45\%) by investigator assessment; median duration of response by IRC assessment was 17.5 months (95\% CI, 7.4-20.3). Median progression-free survival by IRC assessment was 7.3 months (95\% CI, 5.5-9.2). Median overall survival was 24.0 months (95\% CI, 14.6-28.8). In the EXCLAIM cohort, median follow-up was 13.0 months, with confirmed ORR by IRC assessment of 25\% (95\% CI, 17\%-35\%) and by investigator assessment of 32\% (95\% CI, 23\%-43\%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea and rash. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this open-label, phase 1/2 nonrandomized clinical trial, mobocertinib was associated with clinically meaningful benefit in patients with previously treated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC, with a manageable safety profile.},

  abstract = {Exploring resistance mechanisms in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) upon disease progression on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been an area of great interest as it may lead to effective next-line treatment strategies. Here we report a case of emergent MET amplification detected in a tumor sample from a patient with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R mutation after disease progression on erlotinib. The patient subsequently had a sustained partial response to a combination of full-dose osimertinib and crizotinib with excellent tolerance but eventually had central nervous system (CNS) progression. Comprehensive genomic profiling performed on the resected brain sample continued to demonstrate MET amplification as an acquired resistance mechanism. A review of literature shows several groups have utilized similar combination regimens (erlotinib or osimertinib + crizotinib or cabozantinib), albeit with various dosing to target MET alterations in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. As more actionable resistance mechanisms are identified, we envision combination TKI therapy will be readily adopted in clinical practice. Our case report adds to a growing body of evidence that combination osimertinib and crizotinib should be recommended to EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with emergent MET amplification as acquired resistance. More importantly, as crizotinib has limited brain penetration, developing next-generation MET inhibitors with better CNS activity is urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Lorlatinib is a third-generation ALK inhibitor that can overcome the largest number of acquired ALK resistance mutations, including the solvent-front mutation G1202R. Here, we report, for the first time, a novel, sequentially-evolved EML4-ALK variant 3 G1202R/S1206Y double mutation in cis detected in a patient with ALK-positive NSCLC after disease progression on sequential crizotinib, alectinib, and then lorlatinib. Three-dimensional computer modeling of this double mutation and other G1202R-based double mutations with lorlatinib (ALK G1202R/L1196M, ALK G1202R/F1174C, ALK G1202R/l1198F, ALK G1202R/G1269A) were provided to reveal how these double mutations may confer resistance to lorlatinib through diverse steric hindrances in the ALK kinase domain. In addition, we performed a comprehensive literature review on published acquired double or triple ALK mutations that are resistant to lorlatinib from both patient samples and in vitro mutagenesis experiments.}

  abstract = {The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), have been implicated in the progression of several human cancers and are attractive therapeutic targets. PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of {$>$}120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.}

Compared with other clinically available ALK inhibitors, PF-06463922 displayed superior potency against all known clinically acquired ALK mutations, including the highly resistant G1202R mutant. Furthermore, PF-06463922 treatment led to regression of EML4-ALK-driven brain metastases, leading to prolonged mouse survival, in a superior manner. Finally, PF-06463922 demonstrated high selectivity and safety margins in a variety of preclinical studies. These results suggest that PF-06463922 will be highly effective for the treatment of patients with ALK-driven lung cancers, including those who relapsed on clinically available ALK inhibitors because of secondary ALK kinase domain mutations and/or brain metastases.}

  abstract = {Introduction: Patients with life-threatening advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbor an exon 20 deletion and/or insertion mutation (EGFRex20 + ) have limited effective treatment options. The high dose 3rd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib shows promising in vitro activity in EGFRex20 + NSCLC tumors. Methods: The POSITION20 is a single arm phase II, multicenter study investigating 160 mg osimertinib in patients with EGFRex20+, T790M negative NSCLC. We allowed patients to be treatment naïve and to have asymptomatic brain metastases. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes were duration of response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment related adverse events (trAEs). Results: From June 2018 to October 2021, 25 patients were enrolled across five centers in the Netherlands. The median age was 70 years (range, 47–87), 20 patients (80\%) were women, and the median number of previous lines of therapy was 1 (range, 0–3). The exon 20 mutations were clustered between A763 and L777. The most common exon 20 mutations were p.(N771\_H773dup) (n = 3) and p.(A767\_V769dup) (n = 3). The ORR was 28\% (95\% CI, 12–49\%), including seven partial responses, with a median DoR of 5.3 months (range, 2.7–27.6). The median PFS was 6.8 months (95\% CI, 4.6–9.1) and the median OS was 15.2 months (95\% CI, 14.3–16.0). The most common trAEs were diarrhea (72\%), dry skin (44\%), and fatigue (44\%). The primary reason for discon­ tinuation was progressive disease in 14 patients (56\%). Conclusion: The POSITION20 study showed modest antitumor activity in patients with EGFRex20 + NSCLC treated with 160 mg osimertinib, with a confirmed ORR of 28\% and acceptable toxicity.},
