# BCL2

BCL2 is an oncogene located on chromosome 18q21 and encodes for a prosurvival protein whose function is to maintain cellular viability via inhibition of apoptosis. In normal lymphoid cells, oxidative stress, genomic instability, and other insults induce the expression of the BH3 family of proteins, which function to inhibit BCL2 and thus allow apoptosis to proceed.27 In the setting of malignant lymphoma, BCL2 overexpression is synergistic with MYC and other oncogenes and promotes the progression of lymphoma and resistance to chemotherapy.28, 29 BCL2 dysregulation can be seen as a result of chromosomal translocations and gene amplification and has also been linked with increased nuclear factor B signaling.30
