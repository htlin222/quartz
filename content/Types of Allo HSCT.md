# Types of Allo HSCT

based on donor/recipient matching of major HLA antigens on Chr. 6 (4 principal genes for serotyping: HLA-A, -B, -C, & -DR; each w/ 2 alleles ‚à¥ 8 major Ag)

[[HLA-compatible]]

- Matched related (MRD, sibling 8/8 major Ag match):
  - lowest GVHD; preferred donor
- Matched unrelated (MUD):
  - ‚Üë risk of GVHD; ‚à¥ matching of 10 HLA alleles (DQ also) to ‚Üì risk; chance of match correlates w/ ethnicity (NEJM 2014;371:339)
- Mismatched related (eg, 1/8 Ag mismatch):
  - ‚Üë available donor pool, but ‚Üë GVHD, rejection; ‚à¥ need additional immunosuppression
- Haploidentical:
  - typically, between parents and young children or sibs (‚Äúhalf‚Äù match); early post-tx cyclophosphamide reduces GVH by destroying proliferating alloreactive T-cells
- Umbilical cord blood:
  - HSC processed at birth & stored. Yields lower cell number. Need 2 cords per adult. Neonatal immune cells: HLA-mismatch tolerated better, ‚Üì GVHD, slow immune reconstitution ‚Üí ‚Üë late viral infections (Blood 2010;116:4693).

## Graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD)

undesirable side effect of allo HSCT allogeneic T cells view host cells as foreign; ‚Üë incid. w/ mismatch or unrelated donors

## Graft-vs.-tumor (GVT)

desired effect in allo-SCT; graft T cells attack host tumor cells
