# keynote-040

In patients with recurrent or metastatic head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, pembrolizumab monotherapy resulted in a clinically meaningful prolongation of overall survival compared to standard-of-care therapy (8.4 vs. 6.9 months) with a favourable safety profile, supporting its further evaluation as a monotherapy and in combination therapy in earlier stages of disease.
