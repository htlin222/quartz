# Vertigo #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Vertigo

â€¢Â Â Â **Physical exam:** Perform a cranial nerve exam and a **HINTS** exam (**H**ead-**I**mpulse, **N**ystagmus, **T**est of **S**kew); perform an otoscopic exam and assess for hearing loss; evaluate the patientâ€™s gait; perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver

â€¢Â Â Â **Differential diagnosis:**

Peripheral causes

-Â Â Â **Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)**

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Dizziness triggered by changing head position, usually intermittent and brief episodes

â€¢Â Â Â Physical exam: Positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis (no specific labs/imaging required)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Epley maneuver

-Â Â Â **Meniereâ€™s disease**

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Ear fullness, tinnitus, unilateral hearing loss. Most patients cycle between periods with active symptoms followed by prolonged remissions.

â€¢Â Â Â Pathogenesis: Excess fluid buildup in the endolymphatic spaces of the inner ear; the exact mechanism is not entirely clear

â€¢Â Â Â Physical exam: Nystagmus during the acute attack

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis (no specific labs/imaging required)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Avoid substances that cause increased endolymphatic retention (e.g., salt, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine)

-Â Â Â Consider a trial of a thiazide diuretic

-Â Â Â Provide symptomatic relief with meclizine or a scopolamine patch (avoid in the elderly given anticholinergic side effects)

â€¢Â Â Â Complications: Refractory symptoms may require ENT referral to consider surgical interventions

-Â Â Â **Acute vestibular neuritis**

-Â Â Â **Otosclerosis**

Central causes

-Â Â Â **Vestibular migraine**

-Â Â Â **Posterior circulation TIA/stroke** (isolated vertigo from a TIA or stoke is **very** rare)

-Â Â Â **Medication-induced**
