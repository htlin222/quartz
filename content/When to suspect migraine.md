# When to suspect migraine

* Recurrent headache of moderate to severe intensity
* Visual aura
* Family history of migraine
* Onset of symptoms at or around puberty

In the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), migraine is classified into three main types: 
* migraine without aura
* migraine with aura
* chronic migraine

## Types of migraine
* [[Migraine without aura]]
* [[Migraine with aura]]
* [[Chronic migraine]]
* [[Family history of migraine]]

## Recommendations
Suspect migraine without aura in a person with recurrent moderate to severe headache, particularly if pain is unilateral and/or pulsating, and when the person has accompanying symptoms such as photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and/or vomiting.

Suspect migraine with aura in a person with the symptoms above and recurrent, short-lasting visual and/or hemisensory disturbances.

Suspect chronic migraine in a person with â‰¥15 headache days per month.

Suspicion of migraine should be strengthened by a family history of migraine and if onset of symptoms is at or around puberty.
