# molecular_diagnostics-of-chronic_myelogenous_leukemia

- BMBx: Advised at dx for CP, if questions of AP/BC (anytime) & loss/failure of cytogenetic response
- Cytogenetics: Testing for BCR-ABLE1 (& to identify any additional chromosomal abnormalities), repeat if significant â†‘ qPCR or minimal â†“ (eg, loss of CCyR, CHR)
- FISH: For BCRâ€“ABLE1 fusion gene; historically poorer prog w/ 9q deletion
- Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR): Fusion mRNA product, most sensitive technique to detect MRD; used extensively to monitor therapy response (early into deep remission)
- Kinase domain mutational analysis: Not obtained at dx (unless BC), only if failure of TKI
