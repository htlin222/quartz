# Rheumatology - Systemic Sclerosis - Fast Facts | NEJM Resident 360
Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is an autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. SSc has a poor prognosis, and mortality risk is estimated anywhere between two- to fivefold higher than the general population. Most SSc-related deaths are due to complications of pulmonary fibrosis; pulmonary arterial hypertension; cardiac, renal, or gastrointestinal disease; and infections. There is no cure for any manifestation of SSc.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has defined the following subsets of systemic sclerosis:

*   **limited cutaneous****SSc (lcSSc)** includes CREST syndrome (calcifications, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal hypomotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia)
    
*   **diffuse cutaneous****SSc (dcSSc)**
    
*   **SSc without skin involvement** (or “systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma” [ssSSc])  
      
    

### Manifestations

A range of systems can be affected by systemic sclerosis and are outlined in the following table:

| System | Symptoms & Signs |
| --- | --- |
| Skin | Scleroderma  
- lcSSc: typically restricted to hands, face, and neck  
- dcSSc: involves chest, abdomen, forearms, upper arms, and shoulders  
Sclerodactyly  
Telangiectasias |
| Musculoskeletal | Fibrosis around tendons and nerves, manifesting as:  
- arthralgia  
- tendinopathy  
- myalgia  
- neuropathy |
| Vascular | Raynaud phenomenon (occurs in almost all patients with SSc)  
Abnormalities in nail-fold capillaries (seen with a dermatoscope or other similar device)  
Digital ulcers |
| Gastrointestinal | Esophageal dysmotility  
Wide-mouthed diverticula  
Telangiectasias  
Primary biliary cirrhosis |
| Renal | Mild-to-moderate proteinuria  
Increased creatinine  
Hypertension  
Scleroderma renal crisis |
| Pulmonary | Interstitial lung disease  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension  
Pleuritis  
Endobronchial telangiectasias |
| Cardiac | Cardiac fibrosis  
Coronary artery disease  
Pericarditis |

Although not diagnostic for SSc, Raynaud phenomenon develops in almost all patients with SSc:

### Diagnosis

There is no single test to confirm diagnosis of SSc. Rather, diagnosis depends on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and, in some cases, pathologic manifestations. In 2013, the ACR revised classification criteria for SSc. These guidelines are more sensitive for identifying early SSc and are useful for evaluating patients with possible SSc. Using this classification system, a score of 9 classifies a patient as having definite SSC.

### ACR Classification Criteria for SSc

Many antibodies are associated with the various manifestations of SSc. For a summary of the phenotypic characteristics and their autoantibody associations, see table 1, “ Phenotypic Characteristics and Their Autoantibody Associations in Scleroderma,” from Mayo Clinic Proceedings, “My Approach to the Treatment of Scleroderma.” 

### Treatment

Treatment varies depending on the patient’s clinical manifestations. Therapies are either immunomodulatory, target vascular function, or target specific symptoms (i.e., proton pump inhibitors for reflux).

For an outline of important management considerations, see table 2, “Management Principles,” from Mayo Clinic Proceedings, “My Approach to the Treatment of Scleroderma.”
