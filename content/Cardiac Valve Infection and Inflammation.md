### Cardiac Valve Infection and Inflammation

##### Rheumatic fever

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Complication of inflammatory reaction to group A strep spp. Jones criteria: Strep infection and two major criteria OR one major criteria and two minor criteria:

-Â Â Â Major criteria: Migratory polyarthritis, erythema marginatum, cardiac problems (pericarditis, CHF, valve), chorea, subcutaneous nodules

-Â Â Â Minor criteria: Fever, ESR â‰¥60 mm/hr or CRP â‰¥3 mg/L, p\[.omicron\]lyarthralgias, prolonged PR interval on ECG

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat strep pharyngitis with penicillin; NSAIDs or steroids. Consider penicillin prophylaxis to prevent recurrence.

##### Endocarditis

â€¢Â Â Â Infectious endocarditis: See Infectious Diseases Chapter 8

â€¢Â Â Â Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (marantic endocarditis): Rarely, malignancy can cause sterile depositions of fibrin/platelets that attach to the cardiac valves. Treatment: Anticoagulation.

â€¢Â Â Â Nonbacterial verrucous endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis): Noninfectious endocarditis that occurs in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus, typically with vegetations on both sides of the valve. Treatment: Anticoagulation, treat lupus or underlying condition.
