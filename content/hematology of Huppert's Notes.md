**FIGURE 7.7: Agents that cause cancer and progression of normal cells to malignant cells.**

•   Pathophysiology: Genetic and environmental factors can cause normal cells to become malignant. Typically, a solid tumor grows locally first and then has the potential to spread to other organs (metastasize).

•   Diagnosis is based on biopsy-proven diagnosis most of the time – “**tissue is the issue”**

-   Exceptions: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and glioblastoma can be diagnosed _without_ biopsy via imaging

•   General rules of thumb:

-   Biopsy distant metastasis. This provides the opportunity to diagnose the primary tumor type and confirm staging simultaneously.

-   More tissue is better, especially in the era of molecular testing.

-   Core biopsy is generally preferred over fine needle aspiration (FNA) (except FNA preferred for suspected head/neck carcinoma).

•   Key resource: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN.org) has guidelines on initial workup and staging by suspected cancer site. Trainees can register for a free account.
