### Chronic Diarrhea (>3 weeks)

â€¢Â Â Â Work-up:

-Â Â Â Use history/physical to determine the probable subtype of diarrhea (i.e., watery, fatty, or inflammatory)

-Â Â Â Send further diagnostics from the stool based on the suspected subtype (watery = stool osms; fatty = fecal fat; inflammatory = stool RBC/WBC, consider fecal calprotectin)

-Â Â Â Pursue additional testing based on narrowed differential diagnosis

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies: See Table 4.3
