# types of peritoneal dialysis


## Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)	
Manual instillation and drainage of dialytic fluid several times per day
## Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD)
Use of a machine (cycler) to instill and drain fluid a number of times over a period of several hours

## Nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis
(NIPD)
APD performed at night only, with no fluid in the peritoneal cavity during the day

## Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD)
APD at night plus a final installation of fluid into the peritoneal cavity, which remains there during the day; performed with or without an additional exchange of fluid during the course of the day

## Incremental peritoneal dialysis
Initiation of peritoneal dialysis at a low dose, with stepwise increases as needed to compensate for loss of residual kidney function

## Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis
Initiation of peritoneal dialysis within 2 wk after catheter placement in a person with end-stage kidney disease and no previously planned renal replacement therapy
