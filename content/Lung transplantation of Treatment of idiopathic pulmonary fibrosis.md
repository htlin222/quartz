# Lung transplantation of Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Lung transplantation may be an option for patients with progressive disease and minimal comorbidities. For appropriate patients (based on criteria from the United Network for Organ Sharing [UNOS]), we suggest early referral for lung transplantation evaluation rather than waiting until the patient has developed advanced disease (Grade 2C). (See 'Lung transplantation' above.)
