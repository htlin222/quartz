# Amivantamab

> [!tldr] TLDR
>
> Amivantamab is a novel anti-EGFR/c-MET bispecific antibody that has been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor directed against PD-1 on lymphocytes, which is used to treat certain types of cancer. Combination therapy with both agents may be promising in treating NSCLC.

[Amivantamab: a monoclonal EGFR-MET bispecific antibody for EGFR exon 20 insertion in non-small cell lung cancer - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35983925/)

- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved amivantamab, a monoclonal epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mesenchymal--epithelial transition factor (MET) bispecific antibody, in May 2021, to treat adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an insertion mutation in exon 20 of EGFR.
- The approval of amivantamab represents a targeted therapy for this subtype of advanced NSCLC.
- In contrast to other drugs that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity in the protein, EGFR, amivantamab has efficacy in inhibiting EGFR and MET.
- In this article, we summarize the development of therapeutic drugs for NSCLC, discuss the mechanism of action of amivantamab, review data from clinical trials with amivantamab and suggest future lines of research.
