# tumor lysis syndrome

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a medical emergency that occurs when the contents of tumor cells are released into the bloodstream, either spontaneously or in response to therapy.

TLS is primarily associated with aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (e.g., Burkitt lymphoma), acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis. Increasingly, TLS is seen with other tumors, including solid tumors.
