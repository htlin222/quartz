# hyperthyroidism

## [[Etiologies-hyperthyroidism]]

## Clinical manifestations

- Restlessness, sweating, tremor, moist warm skin, fine hair, tachycardia,
- AF, weight loss, â†‘ frequency of stools, menstrual irregularities, hyperreflexia, osteoporosis, stare and lid lag (due to sympathetic overactivity)
- Apathetic thyrotoxicosis: seen in elderly who can present with lethargy as only sx

## Laboratory testing

- â†‘ free T4 and total T3; â†“ TSH (except in TSH-secreting tumors)
- Gold standard: I131 uptake and scan
- RAIU scan is useful study to differentiate causes (see table on page 7-3); cannot do if recent IV contrast or amio load b/c iodine blocks uptake, so âœ“ autoantibodies instead
- No need to âœ“ for autoantibodies except in pregnancy (to assess risk of fetal Gravesâ€™)
- May see hypercalciuria Â± hypercalcemia, â†‘ AÏ•, anemia

## Subclinical hyperthyroidism

[[Subclinical hyperthyroidism]] (NEJM 2018;378:2411)

- Mild â†“ TSH and normal free T4 with only subtle or no sx
- ~15% â†’ overt hyperthyroidism in 2 y; â†‘ risk of AF, CHD, fracture (JAMA 2015;313:2055)
- Rx controversial: consider if TSH <0.1 mU/L and â†‘ risk for CV disease or osteopenic
  [[Thyroid storm]] (extremely rare; JCEM 2015;2:451)
