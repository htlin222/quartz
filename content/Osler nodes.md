# Osler nodes

Osler's nodes result from the deposition of **immune complexes**. The resulting inflammatory response leads to swelling, redness, and pain that characterize these lesions.

The nodes are commonly indicative of subacute bacterial endocarditis. **10â€“25%** of endocarditis patients will have Osler's nodes. Other signs of endocarditis include Roth's spots and Janeway lesions. The latter, which also occur on the palms and soles, can be differentiated from Osler's nodes because they are non-tender.

## Osler's nodes can also be seen in

* Systemic lupus erythematosus
* Marantic endocarditis
* Disseminated gonococcal infection
* Distal to infected arterial catheter
