### Acute Liver Failure (ALF)

â€¢Â Â Â Definitions:

-Â Â Â Acute liver injury (ALI): AST/ALT >100 IU/L

-Â Â Â Acute liver failure (ALF): All three criteria must be present â€“ 1) Coagulopathy (INR >1.5), 2) Hepatic encephalopathy, 3) No preexisting liver disease

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology:

-Â Â Â Major causes: Ischemic hepatitis (e.g., shock liver, Budd-Chiari, hepatic artery thrombus or vasospasm), drug- or toxin-induced liver injury (e.g., acetaminophen, *Amanita* mushrooms), viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (See Table 4.9)

-Â Â Â Other causes: Fulminant Wilsonâ€™s disease, malignancy with infiltration, pregnancy-related, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

-Â Â Â Conditions that do not typically cause ALF: Alcohol-related liver disease, hemochromatosis, NAFLD, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, PSC, PBC

â€¢Â Â Â Workup:

-Â Â Â Viral: Hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface ag/ab/core, hepatitis C virus antibodies, hepatitis C RNA, HSV, EBV, CMV, varicella zoster antibodies, hepatitis E IgM

-Â Â Â Other labs: Acetaminophen level, toxicology screen, ceruloplasmin, urine copper (patients <35 yr), pregnancy test, ANA, anti-SMA, IgG, HIV, amylase/lipase

-Â Â Â Complete abdominal ultrasound with Doppler

-Â Â Â If hepatic encephalopathy is present, consider NCHCT to rule out brain herniation

â€¢Â Â Â Complications: Neurologic (hepatic encephalopathy, herniation), pulmonary (ARDS), cardiac (high-output heart failure), hepatic (hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, coagulopathy), bone marrow suppression, adrenal insufficiency, renal failure (thought to be due to cytokine-induced damage)

â€¢Â Â Â Prognosis: Multiple prognostic scoring systems are available (e.g., Kingâ€™s College Criteria)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Supportive care:

**â€¢**Â Â Â N-acetylcysteine (NAC): Historically only used to treat acetaminophen-related ALF, but there is emerging evidence to consider use of NAC for all patients with ALF

**â€¢**Â Â Â Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if needed

**â€¢**Â Â Â Intracranial hypertension prevention/treatment if needed: Hypertonic saline and then mannitol, goal Na 145 mEq/L, elevate head of bed, intubate if needed

**â€¢**Â Â Â Prophylactic antibiotics

**â€¢**Â Â Â Phosphate repletion

**â€¢**Â Â Â Glucose monitoring/dextrose administration

**â€¢**Â Â Â Enteral feeding

**â€¢**Â Â Â Frequent neurologic checks. Of note, lactulose is *not* used to treat hepatic encephalopathy in ALF

-Â Â Â Treat the underlying cause of ALF: See Table 4.9

-Â Â Â Consider liver transplantation if low probability of recovery
