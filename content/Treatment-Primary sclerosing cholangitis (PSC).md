# Treatment-Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)

- supportive care, fat-soluble vitamins; no meds have improved survival
- UDCA may ↓ Aϕ & improve Sx, but unclear if beneficial
- If dominant stricture → endoscopic dilation, stenting or surgical resection can help
- Cholangiocarcinoma:
  - 15% lifetime risk;
  - annual surveillance w/ MRCP or U/S & CA19-9
- Liver transplantation:
  - ~30% recurrence,
  - though if UC,
  - colectomy may ↓ recurrence
