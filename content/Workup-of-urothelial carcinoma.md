# Workup-of-urothelial carcinoma

Evaluation of entire urinary tract: Cystourethroscopy, consider urine cytology (low sensitivity âˆ¼34%, high specificity âˆ¼98%) (Urology 2003;61:109), abd & upper tract imaging
Initial cystoscopy includes bimanual exam under anesthesia to assess for locally advanced dz, bladder wash for cytology, visual inspection & tumors biopsied or transurethral resection, random bxs if positive urine cytology w/ no visible tumors
If no muscle in specimen, strongly consider repeat TURBT-aim to correctly identify stage & grade while completely resecting all visible tumors
UC are either low-grade or high-grade, w/ muscle-invasive dz almost always high-grade
