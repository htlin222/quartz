# diagnostic test of Budd-Chiari syndrome

- ± ↑ AST, ALT & Aϕ;
  Doppler hepatic veins (85% Se & Sp);
  CT (I+) or MRI/MRV → vein occlusion or ↑ caudate lobe (separate venous drainage);
  hepatic venography gold standard w/ “spider- web” pattern + assess venous pressure; biopsy only if unclear

Elevated levels of AST, ALT, and Alpha-fetoprotein (Aϕ) may be present, but are not required for diagnosis.

## Diagnostic Tests

- Doppler Ultrasound of hepatic veins: **85% sensitivity** and spe
- Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRI/MRV)
- to assess for vein occlusion or increased size of caudate lobe (indicating separate venous drainage)
- Hepatic venography is considered the gold standard with a "**spider-web**" pattern seen in the veins and venous pressure assessed.

- Biopsy is only necessary if the diagnosis is unclear after the above tests.
