### Quantitative Platelet Disorders

**Thrombocytopenia**

â€¢Â Â Â Definition*:* Low number of platelets (<150K/Î¼l)

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms*:* Easy bruising or bleeding (e.g., mucosal bleeding such as gingiva or nasal mucosa, heavy menses, petechiae)

â€¢Â Â Â Work-up*:*

-Â Â Â Get a peripheral blood smear:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Rule out pseudothrombocytopenia (platelet clumping), which can occur in the blood tube when the anticoagulant EDTA is present, causing a spuriously low platelet count. Evaluate by looking for platelet clumping on the blood smear. Resend platelets in a heparin or sodium citrate tube if needed.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Giant platelets can be falsely counted by the automated cell counter as WBCs or RBCs. Large platelets can occur with inherited platelet disorders.

-Â Â Â Take a thorough history:

**â€¢**Â Â Â History of easy bleeding or bruising?

**â€¢**Â Â Â Systemic symptoms â€“ fever, headache, abdominal pain, hematuria, diarrhea? These symptoms can occur with HUS or TTP.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Medications? In the hospital, consider heparin products, antibiotics, immunosuppressants.

**â€¢**Â Â Â History of autoimmune conditions? A history of autoimmune conditions makes ITP more likely.

-Â Â Â Also check PT, PTT, reticulocyte count, fibrinogen, LDH, TSH, HIV, HCV, and other labs guided by the disease entity suspected

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies of thrombocytopenia: Consider three buckets:

-Â Â Â **Decreased production:** Think about processes that cause bone marrow suppression or infiltration. Often multiple cell lines down\!

**â€¢**Â Â Â Aplastic anemia, MDS, leukemia, Fanconi syndrome, infiltrative disorders

**â€¢**Â Â Â Medications/toxins: Alcohol, chemotherapeutic agents, chloramphenicol, benzene, radiation

**â€¢**Â Â Â Infections: Parvovirus, EBV, CMV, HCV, HIV

**â€¢**Â Â Â Nutritional deficiencies: B12 or folate deficiency

-Â Â Â **Increased destruction:** Divide causes by immune-mediated or non-immune mediated. Also see additional details about these conditions in the section below.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Immune-mediated

-Â Â Â Primary: ITP

-Â Â Â Secondary: HIT, other medications (antibiotics, H2 blockers), infections, lupus, APS, lymphoproliferative disease

**â€¢**Â Â Â Non-immune-mediated

-Â Â Â Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA): HUS, TTP, DIC, scleroderma renal crisis

-Â Â Â HELLP

-Â Â Â Mechanical: CVVH

-Â Â Â **Sequestration/dilutional**

**â€¢**Â Â Â Hepatosplenomegaly: Cirrhosis and portal HTN can sequester 90% of platelets

**â€¢**Â Â Â Massive transfusion: 10U pRBCs decrease platelets by 50%
