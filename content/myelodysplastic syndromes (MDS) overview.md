# myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) overview

(Lancet 2014;383:2239)

- Acquired clonal stem cell disorder â†’ ineffective hematopoiesis â†’ cytopenias, dysmorphic blood cells and precursors, variable risk of leukemic transformation
- Epidemiology: 20â€“30,000 cases/y; median age ~70 y; male predominance (1.8Ã—)
- Idiopathic or 2Â° to chemo w/ alkylating agents; â†‘ risk w/ radiation, benzene
- Clinical manifestations:
  - anemia (85%),
  - neutropenia (50%),
  - thrombocytopenia (40â€“65%)
- Diagnosis:

  - dysplasia (usually multilineage) in peripheral smear
    - oval macrocytes,
    - pseudo-Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly
  - and bone marrow (â‰¥10% dysplasia with blasts Â± RS)

- Both

  - cytogenetic [eg, del(5q), mono 7, del(7q), trisomy 8, del(20q)] and
  - molecular abnl (TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, ASXL1, SF3B1, DNMT3A) may carry prognostic signif

- Prior to dx MDS:
  - exclude AML (â‰¥20% blasts) and
  - CMML (monos >1 Ã— 109/L);
  - r/o 2Â° BM Î”s (defic. of B12, folate, copper);
  - viral infxn (eg, HIV); EtOH; lead, arsenic exposures
