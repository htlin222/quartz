# adrenal incidentalomas

- 4% of Pts undergoing abdominal CT scan have incidentally discovered adrenal mass;
- prevalence ↑ with age

## Differential diagnosis

- Nonfunctioning mass:
  - adenoma,
  - cysts,
  - abscesses,
  - granuloma,
  - hemorrhage,
  - lipoma,
  - myelolipoma,
  - primary or metastatic malignancy
- Functioning mass:
  - [[pheochromocytoma]],
  - adenoma (cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones),
  - other endocrine tumor,
  - carcinoma

## Hormonal workup (EJE 2016;175:G1; NEJM 2021;384:1542)

- Rule out subclinical [[Cushing’s Syndrome]]
  - in all Pts using _1 mg overnight DST_ (Sp 91%).
  - Abnormal results require confirmatory testing.
- Rule out hyperaldosteronism
  - if hypertensive w/ plasma aldo & renin (see above)
- Rule out [[pheochromocytoma]]
  - in ALL Pts (b/c of morbidity unRx’d pheo)
  - using 24-h urine fractionated metanephrines or plasma fractionated metanephrines
- [[Malignancy workup-adrenal incidentalomas]]

## Follow-up

- If hormonal workup ⊖ and appearance benign,
- no further follow-up imaging needed,
- but controversial (Annals 2019;171:107)

- biochemical testing to detect [[pheochromocytoma]] and excess cortisol secretion, and those who also have high blood pressure should undergo biochemical testing to detect [[primary hyperaldosteronism]]
- Patients with pheochromocytoma should undergo adrenalectomy after adequate presurgical alpha-blockade and beta-blockade, if necessary.
- Patients with mild autonomous cortisol excess and primary hyperaldosteronism may benefit from adrenalectomy, but treatment should be individualized.
- Nonfunctioning adrenal tumors that have an attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less on computed tomographic (CT) evaluation and that are smaller than 4 cm in greatest diameter generally do not warrant intervention or long-term follow-up.
- All other adrenal incidentalomas with indeterminate features on imaging may warrant additional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT,
  - magnetic resonance imaging with chemical-shift analysis,
  - positron-emission tomography–CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, or all of these tests.
