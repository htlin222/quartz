# Advanced sclerosing LN

-Â Patients with advanced sclerosing glomerulonephritis usually display slowly progressive kidney dysfunction in association with proteinuria and a relatively bland urine sediment.

- Class VI disease is â†’ characterized by global sclerosis of more than 90 percent of glomeruli.
- It represents healing of prior inflammatory injury, as well as the advanced stage of chronic class III, IV, or V lupus nephritis (LN).
- Active glomerulonephritis should not be observed.
- A retrospective study found that 4 percent of 169 kidney biopsies from patients with LN were classified with type VI disease [114].
- Identification of this lesion is â†’ important since immunosuppressive therapy is â†’ unlikely to be beneficial.
