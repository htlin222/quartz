### GYN Malignancies

**Ovarian cancer**

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Median age at diagnosis 63 yr, lifetime risk 1.3%. Risk factors: BRCA 1 or 2 mutation, older age, infertility, endometriosis, PCOS, cigarette smoking. Protective factors: OCPs, previous pregnancy, history of breastfeeding.

â€¢Â Â Â Screening: No screening indicated; if high risk (e.g., ovarian cancer in first degree family member, BRCA mutation) can screen with CA-125, pelvic exams, and transvaginal ultrasounds, but little data

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Subacute presentation. Adnexal mass, ascites, early satiety, weight loss.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Transvaginal/abdominal ultrasound usually visualizes complex adnexal mass. Elevated CA-125. Pathologic diagnosis requires surgical exploration, as needle biopsy can rupture the mass and cause a worse prognosis.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â If surgical candidate: Exploratory-laparotomy for surgical excision \+/â€“ intraperitoneal chemotherapy (survival benefit in patients with small amounts of residual disease confined to the peritoneal cavity following surgery)

-Â Â Â Adjuvant chemotherapy: Paclitaxel, carboplatin

-Â Â Â Surgical debulking improves survival in metastatic disease

â€¢Â Â Â Surveillance: Obtain CA-125 before surgery. Following CA-125 longitudinally post-surgery may help identify recurrence, but has not been shown to impact overall survival.

##### Cervical cancer

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Median age at diagnosis 50 yr. Risk factors: HPV, immunosuppression, HIV, smoking

â€¢Â Â Â Screening: Pap smear (every 3 yr for women age 21â€“29 yr, then every 5 yr with HPV co-testing for women age -30 yr)

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Abnormal vaginal bleeding (post-menopausal, post-coital, intermenstrual)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Pap smear cervical cytology, cervical biopsy and colposcopy

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Early (stage I): Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or cervical conization. After childbearing: Hysterectomy.

-Â Â Â Advanced (stage IIIâ€“IV): Concurrent chemotherapy/radiation therapy (cisplatin-based regimen) or chemotherapy alone for metastatic disease

##### Endometrial cancer

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Median age at diagnosis 60 yr. Risk factors: Excess estrogen (e.g., obesity, postmenopausal estrogen without progesterone opposition), tamoxifen therapy, nulliparity, diabetes, Lynch syndrome

â€¢Â Â Â Screening: No routine screening recommended

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Postmenopausal/irregular bleeding

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Transvaginal ultrasound with thickened endometrial stripe â†’ perform endometrial biopsy

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Surgical resection of the uterus, cervix, and adnexa in early stages; later stages may require chemotherapy/radiation therapy
