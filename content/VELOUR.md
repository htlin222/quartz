# VELOUR

- Design: Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial
- Number of patients: 1226
- Patients characteristics: previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer,
  - including those who received prior `bevacizumab`
- Agent: [[aflibercept]] (4 mg/kg intravenously) or placebo every 2 weeks in combination with [[FOLFIRI]]
- Treatment line: second-line or later
- Trial Name/NCT Number: [[VELOUR]]/NCT00561470

| Group | Progression-free survival (PFS) | Overall survival (OS) | Response rate (RR) |
|-------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Aflibercept + FOLFIRI | 6.90 months | 13.50 months | 19.8% |
| Placebo + FOLFIRI | 4.67 months | 12.06 months | 11.1% |

- Other findings:
  - Aflibercept significantly improved PFS and OS compared to placebo
  - Effects demonstrated consistent trend across prespecified subgroup analyses, including bevacizumab pretreated patients
  - Adverse effects included anti-vascular endothelial growth factor effects and increased incidence of some chemotherapy-related toxicities

- Summary: The VELOUR trial showed that adding aflibercept to FOLFIRI significantly improved PFS, OS, and response rate in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, including those who received prior bevacizumab. The survival benefit was statistically significant and consistent across prespecified subgroup analyses. However, adverse effects were reported, including anti-vascular endothelial growth factor effects and increased incidence of some chemotherapy-related toxicities.
