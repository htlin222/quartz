# autologous_stem_cell_transplantation

## Description

High-dose therapy & autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) rely on cytotoxic effects of HDC/radiation to treat hematologic malignancies followed by infusion of auto stem cells to ‚Äúrescue‚Äù from profound pancytopenia (generally no significant graft-vs.-malignancy effect)
Tx intent (curative vs. palliative) depends on dz

- Stem cell source
  - Stem cells should be collected prior to exposure to an alkylator (eg, melphalan), nitrogen mustard or purine analog as these agents are stem cell toxic
  - Collection is done by PBSC apheresis following G-CSF ¬± plerixafor or chemomobilization (BM harvesting only very rarely used for ASCT)
  - Collected CD34+ stem cells are cryopreserved until time of transplant

## Conditioning regimens

- All conditioning regimens are **myeloablative** & combine HDC ¬± radiation given prior to stem cell infusion to eradicate dz
- Melphalan-based regimens are commonly used for the tx of plasma cell dyscrasias & lymphoma (commonly treated w/ BEAM: BCNU, Etoposide, Ara-C, Melphalan)
