### Gallbladder Stone Diseases

##### Cholelithiasis

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Stone in the **gallbladder**

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Patients may be asymptomatic or develop biliary colic

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: RUQ ultrasound

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Elective cholecystectomy, if symptomatic

â€¢Â Â Â Types of stones: *Cholesterol*: Obesity, multiparity, OCPs, rapid weight loss. *Pigmented*: Hemolysis, cirrhosis, biliary infections, TPN



**FIGURE 4.6: Anatomy of the biliary tree and the types of gallbladder stone disease.** Shown is the biliary tree and the passage of gallstones through this system: 1) Cholelithiasis; 2) Cholecystitis; 3) Choledocholithiasis; 4) Cholangitis. Of note, cholangitis can be due to obstruction from a gallstone or another cause (see chapter text).

##### Cholecystitis

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Stone in the **cystic duct**

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Acute inflammation of the gallbladder wall which causes RUQ pain, N/V, fever, leukocytosis, \+Murphyâ€™s sign (inspiratory arrest during deep palpation of RUQ)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: RUQ ultrasound, if inconclusive consider HIDA scan

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: IVF, NPO, IV antibiotics. Then early cholecystectomy (within 24â€“48 hr). If poor surgical candidate, achieve drainage with a percutaneous cholecystostomy.

â€¢Â Â Â Subtypes:

-Â Â Â Acalculous cholecystitis: Cholecystitis in the absence of a stone. More common in patients that are very ill (e.g., ICU patients, burn patients). Treatment: If necrosis, perforation, or emphysematous cholecystitis, needs emergent cholecystectomy or percutaneous drainage.

-Â Â Â Emphysematous cholecystitis: Infection of the gallbladder with gas-forming bacteria. Ultrasound shows air-fluid levels and gas shadows. Treatment: IVF, antibiotics, early cholecystectomy

â€¢Â Â Â Post-cholecystectomy syndrome: Persistent abdominal pain post-operatively or months/years later due to a retained stone or extrabiliary problem. Patients also may have bile salt wasting and diarrhea. Diagnosis: RUQ ultrasound, MRCP, or ECRP. Treatment: Bile acid sequestrants.

##### Choledocholithiasis

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Stone in the **common bile duct**

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Abdominal pain, fever. Labs notable for initial transaminitis followed by a cholestatic elevation. RUQ ultrasound may show biliary dilatation.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: High risk: ERCP with removal of stone, followed by elective cholecystectomy. Intermediate risk: MRCP, if positive proceed to ERCP. Low risk: If gallstones/sludge seen on RUQ ultrasound, consider elective cholecystectomy.

##### Cholangitis

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Infection of the biliary ducts due to obstruction (stone, tumor, stricture), biliary stasis, or bacterial overgrowth.

â€¢Â Â Â Classic symptoms: Charcotâ€™s triad: 1) RUQ pain, 2) Jaundice, 3) Fever. Reynoldâ€™s pentad: The prior triad and in addition: 4) Septic shock, 5) Altered mental status

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: RUQ ultrasound, hyperbilirubinemia, leukocytosis, mild elevation serum transaminases

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: IV antibiotics, IVF. Perform ERCP with sphincterotomy, stone extraction, and/or stenting within 24â€“48 hours
