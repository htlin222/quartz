✓ cell counts, TP, LDH, glc, Gram stain & Cx, AFB, cytology
ADA, PCR for MTb, and specific tumor markers as indicated by clinical suspicion
“exudate”: TP >3 g/dL, TPeff/TPserum >0.5, LDHeff/LDHserum >0.6 or glc <60 mg/dL; high Se (~90%) but very low Sp (~20%); overall low utility (Chest 1997;111:1213)
