- 6-MERCAPTOPURINE and 6-THIOGUANINE
  - Inhibit purine ring biosynthesis
  - Inhibit DNA synthesis
- PEMETREXED and METHOTREXATE
  - Inhibit dihydrofolate reduction,
  - block [[thymidylate]] and purine synthesis
- CAMPTOTHECINS ETOPOSIDE TENIPOSIDE DAUNORUBICIN DOXORUBICIN
  - Block [[topoisomerase]] function
- HYDROXYUREA
  - Inhibits ribonucleotide reductase
- [[5-fluorouracil]]
  - Inhibits thymidylate synthesis
- GEMCITABINE CYTARABINE FLUDARABINE 2-CHLORODEOX YADENOSINE CLOFARABINE
  - Inhibit DNA synthesis
- PLATINUM ANALOGUES ALKYLATING AGENTS MITOMYCIN TEMOZOLOMIDE
  - Form adducts with DNA
- L-ASPARAGINASE
  - Deaminates asparagine
  - Inhibits protein synthesis
- EPOTHILONES TAXANES VINCA ALKALOIDS ESTRAMUSTINE
  - Inhibit function of microtubules
