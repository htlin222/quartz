# Imaging-Diagnosis-osteomyelitis


* Plain radiographs: **normal early in disease**; **lytic lesions seen after 2–6 wk**
* MRI: **preferred imaging study** (overall Se 90%, Sp 82%; Archives 2007;167:125)
* CT: can demonstrate periosteal reaction and cortical and medullary destruction
* CT & MRI very Se but ↓ Sp; false ⊕ if contig focus w/ periosteal reaction, Charcot Δs
* Radionuclide imaging: very Se but non-Sp (false ⊕ if soft-tissue inflammation)


## Explain by ChatGPT

1. Plain x-rays: normal in the beginning stages of the disease; after 2-6 weeks, lytic lesions can be seen.
2. MRI: the preferred imaging study. It is very accurate in identifying the disease (overall Se 90%, Sp 82%).
3. CT: can show periosteal reaction, cortical and medullary destruction.
4. CT and MRI are very accurate in identifying the disease, but can sometimes give false positive results if there is a contigous focus with periosteal reaction or Charcot lesions.
5. Radionuclide imaging: very accurate in identifying the disease, but can sometimes give false positive results if there is soft-tissue inflammation.

1. X線平片：發病初期正常； 2-6 週後，可見溶解性病變。
2. MRI：首選影像學檢查。它在識別疾病方面非常準確（總體 Se 90%，Sp 82%）。
3. CT：可顯示骨膜反應，皮質和髓質破壞。
4. CT和MRI對疾病的鑑別非常準確，但如果有鄰近病灶伴有骨膜反應或Charcot病變，有時會出現假陽性結果。
5.放射性核素顯像：對疾病的鑑別非常準確，但如果有軟組織炎症，有時會出現假陽性結果。
