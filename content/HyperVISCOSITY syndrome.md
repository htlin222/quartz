# HyperVISCOSITY syndrome

## Diagnostic Considerations

- Multiple myeloma
- WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia
- Leukostasis (see the Medscape Reference article Oncologic Emergencies, under Hyperleukocytosis)
- Polycythemia
- Thrombocytosis

## management
- Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice for initial management and stabilization of HVS from elevated immunoglobulin levels. [5] Leukapheresis, plateletpheresis, and phlebotomy are indicated for HVS from leukostasis, thrombocytosis, and polycythemia, respectively.
