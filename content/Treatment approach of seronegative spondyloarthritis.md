# Treatment approach of seronegative spondyloarthritis

- Untreated disease may lead to irreversible structural damage and associated â†“ function
- Early physiotherapy beneficial
- Tight control of inflammation may improve outcomes (eg, in PsA; Lancet 2015;386:2489)

---

- _NSAIDs_: 1st line; rapidly â†“ stiffness and pain; prolonged, continuous administration may modify disease course but associated w/ GI and CV toxicity (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2015;17:CD010952); may exacerbate IBD
- Intra-articular corticosteroids in mono- or oligoarthritis; limited role for systemic steroids, esp. for axial disease
- _Conventional DMARDs_ (eg, MTX, SSZ, leflunomide):
  - no efficacy for axial disease or enthesitis; may have a role in peripheral arthritis, uveitis, and extra-articular manifestations
- _Anti-TNFs_:
  - effective for both axial and peripheral SpA, improves function and may slow progression of structural changes; adalimumab or infliximab preferred if eyes involved
- _Anti-IL17A_ (secukinumab, ixekizumab):
  - for both AS and axial and peripheral PsA (NEJM 2015;373:1329 & 2534; Lancet 2015;386:1137)
- _Anti-IL12/23_ (ustekinumab) and anti-IL23 (guselkumab)
  - for both axial & peripheral PsA (Lancet 2020;395:1115) but not axial SpA (Arthritis Rheumatol 2019;71:258)
- _PDE-4 inhibitor_ ([[apremilast]]):
  - effective in PsA refractory to conventional DMARD or as first-line (Rheumatology 2018;7:1253); a/w GI side effects and wt loss
- JAK inhibitor:
  - for conventional DMARD- or anti-TNF-resistant peripheral and/or axial SpA (NEJM 2017;377:1525 & 1537; 2021;384:1227)
- Other:
  - Abx indicated in ReA if active GU infxn but not typically needed for uncomplicated enteric infx. Can consider prolonged abx for refractory Chlamydia ReA (Arthritis Rheum 2010;62:1298), but controversial.
  - Involve ophtho if suspect eyes affected (may need steroid drops or intravitreal injection)
  - Treat underlying IBD when appropriate
