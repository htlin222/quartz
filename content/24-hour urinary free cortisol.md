# 24-hour urinary free cortisol

Normal range is 4 to 40 mcg/24 hours or 11 to 110 nmol/day.

## A higher than normal level may indicate

1. Cushing disease, in which the pituitary gland makes too much ACTH because of excess growth of the pituitary gland or a tumor in the pituitary gland
2. Ectopic Cushing syndrome, in which a tumor outside the pituitary or adrenal glands makes too much ACTH
3. Severe depression
4. Tumor of the adrenal gland that is producing too much cortisol
5. Severe stress
6. Rare genetic disorders

## A lower than normal level may indicate

1. Addison disease in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol
2. Hypopituitarism in [[which]] the pituitary gland does not signal the adrenal gland to produce enough cortisol
3. Suppression of normal pituitary or adrenal function by glucocorticoid medicines including pills, skin creams, eyedrops, inhalers, joint injections, chemotherapy
