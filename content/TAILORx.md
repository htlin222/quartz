## Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Women with Midrange Recurrence Score of 21-Gene Breast Cancer Assay

1. Design:
   - Prospective trial
   - Multi-center
   - Randomized
2. Number of patients: 10,273 women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer
3. Patients characteristics:
   - Hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer
   - Midrange recurrence score of 11 to 25
4. Agent:
   - Endocrine therapy alone
   - Chemoendocrine therapy
5. Treatment line: Adjuvant therapy
6. Trial Name: TAILORx

| Outcome                  | Endocrine therapy alone     | Chemoendocrine therapy |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Invasive DFS             | Noninferior                 | Noninferior            |
| HR                       | 1.08 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.24) | -                      |
| p-value                  | 0.26                        | -                      |
| OS                       | Similar                     | Similar                |
| Chemotherapy benefit DFS | 50 < and score 16 to 25     | -                      |

8. Other findings in this trial:
   - Endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine therapy had similar efficacy in women with midrange 21-gene recurrence score.
   - Chemotherapy benefit varied with the combination of recurrence score and age.
