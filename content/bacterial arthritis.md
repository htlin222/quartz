- Treatment for native joints (IDCNA 2017;31:203)
  - Prompt empiric antibiotics guided by Gram stain after surgical drainage.
  - If Gram stain âŠ–, empiric Rx w/ vancomycin;
    - add anti-pseudomonal agent if IVDU or immunocompromised.
- [[Treatment for native joints]] ó°’– (IDCNA 2017;31:203)
  - IV antibiotics Ã— â‰¥2 wk followed by oral antibiotics; varies by clinical course & microbiology
  - Joint must be drained, often serially w/ arthroscopy (larger joints, initial Rx) or arthrocentesis. Serial synovial fluid analyses should demonstrate â†“ in WBC and sterility.
  - 10-15% mortality (up to 50% w/ polyarticular); depends on virulence, time to Rx, host
