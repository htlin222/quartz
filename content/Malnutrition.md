### Malnutrition

â€¢Â Â Â Risk factors: Critical illness often associated with increased catabolism and muscle breakdown

â€¢Â Â Â Benefits of adequate nutrition: Maintains gut integrity and prevents bacterial translocation, reduces risk of stress ulcer formation, possibly reduces the risk of infection and may decrease mortality

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Enteral nutrition within 48 hours is preferred; however, parenteral nutrition is necessary in some patients with contraindications to enteral nutrition
