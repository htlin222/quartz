# mechanisms of hypophosphatemia

## Intracellular uptake of phosphate from the extracellular fluid #anki
- acute respiratory alkalosis:
	- increased intracellular pH stimulates phosphofructokinase activity and glycolysis which leads to intracellular uptake of phosphate;
	- hyperventilation (caused for example by sepsis, anxiety, diabetic ketoacidosis, or other underlying conditions) can precipitate intracellular shift of phosphate into cells;
- refeeding of malnourished patients;
- administration of insulin or glucose (which stimulates insulin secretion);
hungry bone syndrome.

## Reduced intestinal phosphate absorption: #anki
- inadequate intake is not sufficient to cause hypophosphatemia but contributes to other mechanisms;
- nonabsorbable antacids containing aluminum and magnesium block intestinal absorption of phosphorus;
- vitamin D is required for phosphate absorption; chronic diarrhea can contribute, especially if malabsorption syndromes leads to vitamin D deficiency.

## Increased renal excretion due to: #anki
- elevated phosphaturic hormones (parathyroid hormone [PTH] or fibroblast growth factor [FGF-23]); common medications including bisphosphonates and denosumab may increase PTH secretion and result in drug-induced hypophosphatemia;
- decreased renal tubular absorptive capacity as a result of:
	- diuretics;
	- [[Fanconi Syndrome]];
	- genetic defects in renal tubule phosphate transporters.
