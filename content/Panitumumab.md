# Panitumumab

[Panitumumab-FOLFOX4 Treatment and RAS Mutations in Colorectal Cancer | NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1305275)

## Colorectal cancer, metastatic, RAS wild-type

- Single agent therapy:
  - IV: 6 mg/kg every 14 days; continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (Ref).
- In combination with [[CAPOX]] (capecitabine and oxaliplatin; off-label combination): IV: 9 mg/kg every 21 days for at â†£ least 6 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (Ref).
- In combination with FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin): IV: 6 mg/kg every 14 days; continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (Ref). Note: Data from a phase 3 randomized, multicenter trial showed significantly improved overall survival in patients with previously untreated RAS wild-type and left-sided metastatic colorectal cancer who received panitumumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 (Ref).
- In combination with FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan; off-label combination): IV: 6 mg/kg every 14 days; continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (Ref).
- In combination with FOLFOXIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan; off-label combination): IV: 6 mg/kg every 14 days until disease progression or resection for up to a maximum of 12 preoperative cycles; after resection, patients received the same regimen as adjuvant therapy for a total of 12 perioperative cycles (Ref).
- As maintenance therapy (in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin) following 6 cycles of FOLFOX plus panitumumab; off-label combination): IV: 6 mg/kg every 14 days; continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (Ref).
