# rtog_91-11

- These 10-year results show that induction PF followed by RT and concomitant cisplatin/RT show similar efficacy for the composite end point of LFS.
- Locoregional control and larynx preservation were significantly improved with concomitant cisplatin/RT compared with the induction arm or RT alone.
- New strategies that improve organ preservation and function with less morbidity are needed
