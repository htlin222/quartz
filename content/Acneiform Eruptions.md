### Acneiform Eruptions

##### Acne vulgaris

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Inflammation of the hair follicle/sebaceous gland due to increased sebum production (androgen driven), abnormal keratinization, and proliferation of *Cutibacterium acnes* (formerly *P. acnes*)

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Open comedones (blackheads), closed comedones (whiteheads), inflammatory papules and pustules (can progress to nodulocystic lesions and scars) on the face, neck, chest, shoulders, and back

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Mild: Topical antimicrobial (benzoyl peroxide, erythromycin, clindamycin) \+/âˆ’ topical retinoid

-Â Â Â Moderate: Topical combination therapy (antimicrobial \+ retinoid)

-Â Â Â Severe: Oral antibiotic (doxycycline, minocycline) or oral isoretinoin (requires birth control if woman of childbearing potential)

##### Rosacea

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Immune dysfunction, *Demodex* mites, and vascular hyperreactivity

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Common in adults age 30â€“60 yr with light complexions (Celtic ancestry); much more common in females than males

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Centrofacial erythema (especially the nose and medial cheeks), papules and pustules, flushing, telangiectasias, and phymatous changes (e.g., skin thickening and sebaceous hyperplasia); frequently triggered by stress, alcohol, heat, spicy foods, or sunlight

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Avoidance of triggers, topical metronidazole or azelaic acid, oral antibiotics (doxycycline, minocycline), laser therapy

##### Hidradenitis suppurativa

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Inflammatory skin disease of the apocrine glands

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Begins after puberty, more commonly affects women and prevalence is disproportionately high among African Americans

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Tender inflammatory nodules, abscesses, draining sinuses, and scarring in the intertriginous areas (e.g., axilla, groin, under the breasts, vulva, perineal area)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Weight loss and tobacco cessation, skin decolonization (bleach baths, chlorhexidine), oral antibiotics (tetracyclines, clindamycin, rifampin), TNF-inhibitors (adalimumab, infliximab), surgical excision (although recurrence is common)
