### Diseases of the Vasculature

##### Hypertensive emergency

â€¢Â Â Â Definitions: Elevated SBP with end-organ damage

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: See etiologies for hypertension in General Medicine Chapter 10; in particular consider medication noncompliance, stimulant use (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamines), hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, Cushingâ€™s, pre eclampsia, vasculitis, renal artery stenosis

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: CNS symptoms (e.g., mental status changes, visual changes, papilledema, encephalopathy), renal injury (e.g., hematuria, AKI), cardiac injury (e.g., ACS, ADHF), pulmonary edema

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 25% in 1â€“2 hours (then slower after). IV medications: Nitroprusside or nicardipine gtt

##### Aortic dissection

â€¢Â Â Â Definitions:

-Â Â Â Type A: Dissection of the ascending aorta

-Â Â Â Type B: Dissection of the descending aorta

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Risk factors: Hypertension (most common), stimulant use (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamines), connective tissue disease, bicuspid aortic valve

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical presentation: 1) Abrupt onset tearing pain in the chest or back; 2) Pulse and/or BP asymmetry in each arm or between the arms and the legs

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: CT Angiogram. On CXR, see widened mediastinum. Sometimes need TEE to confirm the diagnosis.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Type A: Emergent surgery, in meantime medical management

-Â Â Â Type B: Medical management: IV BB to lower HR, then IV nitroprusside to lower BP (goal SBP 100â€“120 mmHg within 20 minutes)

##### Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Atherosclerosis, hypertension, smoking, syphilis, connective tissue disorders

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical: Pulsatile abdominal mass (rarely detect clinically); instead usually diagnosed on screening imaging or incidentally on abdominal imaging obtained for another purpose

â€¢Â Â Â Screening: Ultrasound: One-time screening ultrasound indicated in men age 65â€“75 yr who have ever smoked. Insufficient evidence for screening ultrasounds in women

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Open vs. endovascular repair

-Â Â Â Repair if 1) AAA >5.5 cm in men or AAA >5 cm in women; 2) Rapid rate of expansion, >0.5 cm in 6 months or >1 cm in 1 yr; 3) Symptoms due to the AAA

-Â Â Â Rupture: Triad of 1) Abdominal pain; 2) Hypotension; 3) Palpable pulsatile abdominal mass Treatment: Open repair

##### Peripheral artery disease (PAD)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Abnormal narrowing of the arteries, most commonly affecting the legs. Risk factors = atherosclerotic risk factors. Common vessels affected include the superficial femoral artery, popliteal artery (causes calf pain), aortoiliac artery (causes butt/hip pain)

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical presentation: Claudication, leg pain at rest (especially at night, hanging foot over the bed often relieves the pain). Signs: Diminished pulses, less hair over legs/feet, ulcers

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Ankle-brachial index (ABI): ABI <1.0 is diagnostic of PAD. Claudication typically develops if ABI <0.7 and rest pain if <0.4. If vessel calcification is present (ABI >1.4) then non-interpretable and get toe-brachial index

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Smoking cessation, exercise, aspirin, (phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor (e.g., cilostazol, contraindicated in heart failure). Percutaneous intervention (e.g., balloon angioplasty, stenting), surgery (i.e., bypass grafting).

##### Acute arterial occlusion

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Native arterial thrombosis, arterial (or paradoxical) embolism, arterial injury

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical: Six **P**s: **P**ain (acute), **P**allor, **P**oikilothermic (cold), **P**aralysis, **P**aresthesia, **P**ulselessness

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: CTA to determine the site of occlusion

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Immediate IV heparin gtt and vascular procedure/surgery; Use anticoagulation with caution for suspected cholesterol emboli
