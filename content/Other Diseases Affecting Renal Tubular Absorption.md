### Other Diseases Affecting Renal Tubular Absorption

##### Renal papillary necrosis

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Poor medullary perfusion resulting in ischemia and necrosis. Most often bilateral. Caused by vascular disease (diabetes), vasoconstriction (NSAIDs), vascular occlusion (sickle cell).

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Stop offending agent, treat the underlying disease

##### Hartnup Syndrome

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Rare autosomal recessive inborn error of amino acid metabolism. Impaired amino acid absorption in the gut and proximal renal tubule causing variable losses of proteins (e.g., tryptophan).

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Variable. Can be similar to pellagra: Dermatitis, diarrhea, ataxia, psychiatric findings

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Elevated amino acids in the urine

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Supplemental nicotinamide if symptomatic

##### Fanconi Syndrome

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Primary (idiopathic) or secondary proximal tubule dysfunction causing defective transport of glucose, amino acids, Na\+, K\+, phosphorus, uric acid, bicarb. Causes include genetic (Wilsonâ€™s disease, galactosemia), acquired damage from heavy metals, connective tissue disorders, hematologic malignancies (monoclonal gammopathy), and medications (tenofovir, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors).

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Glucosuria, phosphaturia (rickets, osteomalacia), proteinuria, polyuria, dehydration, hypercalciuria, hypokalemia

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat the underlying cause if possible. Electrolyte and vitamin D supplementation may be required.
