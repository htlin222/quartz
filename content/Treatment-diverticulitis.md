* Mild: outPt Rx indicated if Pt has few comorbidities and can tolerate POs
PO abx: (MNZ + FQ) or amox/clav for 7 d; liquid diet until clinical improvement

No abx is noninferior to abx in uncomplicated diverti (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2021;19:503)

* Severe: inPt Rx if cannot take POs, narcotics needed for pain, or complications

NPO, IVF, NGT (if ileus); IV abx (GNR & anaerobic coverage; eg, CTX/MNZ or pip-tazo)

After source control, 4 d abx may be sufficient (NEJM 2015;372:1996)
