Migraine without aura is characterized by 
recurrent headache attacks that last 4–72 h. 
Typical features of an attack include a unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity,

However, bilateral pain is not uncommon; 
population-based data indicate that ~40% of individuals with migraine report bilateral pain during attacks. 
The most common associated symptoms are photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and vomiting

Before the onset of pain, prodromal symptoms can include a depressed mood, yawning, fatigue and cravings for specific foods. 

After resolution of the headache, postdromal symptoms can last up to 48 h and often include tiredness, concentration difficulties and neck stiffness15.
