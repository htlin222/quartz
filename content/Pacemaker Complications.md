# Pacemaker Complications

## Perforation
Effusion/tamp/pain
Typically acute, consider if HoTN
## Failure to pace
Bradycardia
↓ Battery, lead fx/dislodgment, ↑ pacing threshold due to tissue rxn/injury; oversense → inapprop. inhib
## Failure to sense
Inapprop. pacing
Lead dislodgment or sensing threshold too high
## PM-mediated tachycardia
WCT at device upper rate
Seen w/ DDD. V → A retrograde conduction; sensed by A lead → triggers V pacing → etc.
## PM syndrome
Palpit, HF
Seen w/ VVI, due to loss of AV synchrony
