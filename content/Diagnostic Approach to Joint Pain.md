### Diagnostic Approach to Joint Pain

##### (1) Consider non-articular mimics of joint pain

•   Articular structures: Synovium, synovial fluid, articular cartilage, intraarticular ligaments, joint capsule, and juxtaarticular bone

•   Non- or peri-articular structures: Extraarticular ligaments, tendons, bursae, muscle, fascia, bone, nerve, and overlying skin

##### (2) Characterize the joint pain

•   Temporality: Acute versus chronic

-   **Acute**: <6 weeks

-   **Chronic**: >6 weeks

•   Inflammation: Inflammatory or non-inflammatory; assess for inflammatory features:

-   History: Morning stiffness lasting >30–60 min

-   Exam: “Rubor, calor, tumor” – Peri-articular erythema, warmth and joint swelling

-   Labs: Elevated ESR and/or CRP, synovial fluid WBC >2K cells/μL 

•   Number of joints involved: Mono-, oligo-, and polyarthritis

-   **Monoarthritis**: Single joint

-   **Oligoarthritis**: 2–4 joints

-   **Polyarthritis**: ≥5 joints

##### (3) Analyze synovial fluid

Synovial fluid analysis is particularly critical in patients with acute monoarthritis.

•   Cell count:

-   **WBC** <2K cells/μL: Noninflammatory

**•**   Bloody: Trauma, coagulopathy, tumor

**•**   Non-bloody: OA, avascular necrosis, Charcot arthropathy (peripheral neuropathy resulting in unwitting pathologic joint trauma typically in the feet and ankles)

-   **WBC 2–10K cells/**μ**L**: Inflammatory arthritis, gout, and pseudogout

-   **WBC** >**20K cells/**μ**L**: Very high concern for infectious arthritis; gout and pseudogout are also possible, but orthopedic surgical consultation for consideration of washout is essential

•   Crystals:

-   **Monosodium urate**: Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals (yellow when parallel to the microscope polarization axis). Suggestive of gout in the setting of acute monoarthritis.

-   **Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate**: Rhomboid crystals with weak positive birefringence (blue when parallel to the polarization axis). Suggestive of pseudogout in the setting of acute monoarthritis.
