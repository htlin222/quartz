â€¢Â Â Â Bile duct stricture: May be benign or malignant, and can cause obstructive jaundice. Treatment: Endoscopic dilation, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain, stenting, or surgical bypass.

â€¢Â Â Â Biliary dyskinesia: Motor dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi. Causes recurrent biliary colic without evidence of gallstones. Diagnosis: HIDA scan with administration of cholecystokinin (CCK) to determine the gallbladder ejection fraction. Treatment: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, sphincterotomy.
