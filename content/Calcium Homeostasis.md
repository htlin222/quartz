# Calcium Homeostasis
**Calcium Homeostasis / PTH / Vitamin D**

**Physiology of Calcium, Phosphate and Bone**:

> 99% of the body's Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present in bones
> 
> 1% is required for **fertilization, vision, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, blood clotting**, exocytosis, cell division and the activity of many enzymes and hormones

> *The concentration of calcium in the cellular and extracellular fluids must be maintained at a constant value.*

**Definitions**:

Resorption: the process of breaking down and assimilating (Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization)

Reabsorption: the process of re-absorbing (absorbing again)

1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>: Vitamin D (active form, 1,25 D)

PTH: Parathyroid hormone

CT: Calcitonin

**Physiology of Calcium Metabolism**:

> **Low Plasma Calcium**: stimulates PTH release, and PTH acts to resorb Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the pool in bone and to enhance renal re-absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
> 
> **High Plasma Calcium**: stimulates CT secretion which lowers plasma calcium by inhibiting bone resorption

**Parathyroid Hormone**:

> i) functions to raise plasma calcium via bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption
> 
> ii) stimulates the metabolism of Vitamin D to its active hormonal form, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>

**Parathyroid Hormone Secretion and Calcium Homeostasis in the Parathyroid Cell**:

1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>: enhances PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> absorption which in turn eleicits bone mineralization preventing Rickets in children and bone remodeling / strengthening in adults

**Vitamin D**: more later.....

Functions-

> i) promotes calcium absorption from the gut
> 
> ii) promotes calcium reabsorption from the kidney
> 
> iii) promotes calcium mobilization from bone via resorption
> 
> iv) enhances phosphate absorption by the intestine

**Control of Blood Ca****<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>**:

**Clinical Correlate**(**s**):

**Hyperparathyroidism**-

> Excessive PTH usually due to a Parathyroid Adenoma, breaks the feedback loops
> 
> Symptoms- renal stones, bone pain (due to increased bone resorption)

**Hypoparathyroidism**-

> Lack of PTH (usually due to removal of the parathyroid gland along w/ the thyroid)
> 
> Symptoms- hypocalcemia
> 
> Treatment- large doses of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> to raise blood calcium through intestinal calcium absorption

**Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)**: Chemistry, Biosynthesis and Biochemical Actions

> PTH is an 84 A.A. peptide initially biosynthesized as prepro-PTH
> 
> PTH acts upon target cells primarily to increase cAMP via G<sub><span size="+1">s</span></sub>
> 
> Kidney is the primary site of PTH action
> 
> PTH infusion will sharply increase urinary cAMP levels, as well as producing a marked increase in urinary phosphate levels (PTH inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption)

**Clinical Correlate**: **Pseudohypoparathroidism** (PsHP)

> Symptoms: short stature, round face, abnormally short fingers and toes, subcutaneous calcification and mental deficiency
> 
> Cause: deficiency in the G<sub><span size="+1">s</span></sub> protein that couples receptors to adenylate cyclase, G<sub><span size="+1">s</span></sub> activity is only about 50% of normal

> Since G<sub><span size="+1">s</span></sub> couples many other hormone receptors to adenylate cyclase, TSH, glucagon etc, severely affected patients display resistance to these hormones as well.

**Calcitonin (CT)**: is a 32 amino acid peptide secreted by the thyroid under conditions of hypercalcemia

> It operates via receptors in bone that are coupled to adenylate cyclase through G<sub><span size="+1">s</span></sub> and raise cAMP levels.

*How* can CT act on bone to lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> resorption while PTH increases resorption when both function via G<sub><span size="+1">s</span></sub> to raise cAMP???

*Answer*: two opposing hormones can act via the same signal transduction pathway in the same tissue if they affect different cell types.

> ***CT*** raises cAMP in bone resorbing osteoclasts ----> inhibit their activity

> ***PTH*** raises cAMP in osteoblasts ----> secrete resorptive factors ----> activate osteoclasts

**Vitamin D**:

The Synthesis of Vitamin D:

Vitamin D is classified as a fat soluble vitamin, however with adequate sunlight exposure humans do not need dietary vitamin D because with sunlight vitamin D can be synthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol

**Photosynthesis of Vitamin D****<sub>3</sub>**:

**Metabolism of Vitamin D**:

> Vitamin D itself does not act upon intestine, kidney and bone but must be bioactivated in the liver and kidney

**The Bioactivation and Inactivation of Vitamin D****<sub>3</sub>**:

**1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>**-is known as the active "*hormonal*" form of vitamin D because:

> 1. It stimulates calcium absorption more rapidly than other forms of vitamin D.
> 
> 2. It is more active on a molar basis than any other form.
> 
> 3. it is produced in kidney in a regulated fashion, based on the need for calcium and/or phosphate.
> 
> 4. It has specific receptors in intestine, bone and kidney.
> 
> 5. It chemically resembles the steroid hormones.

**Regulation of 1,25(OH)****<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> Production**:

OHase- Hydroxylase

> **Note**: When Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> are elevated, 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> is metabolized to 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3 </sub> an inactive metabolite.

**1,25(OH)****<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>** production is **stimulated** under the following conditions:

> 1. Low dietary calcium: PTH is secreted, which activates the 1-OHase in kidney to produce 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>.
> 
> 2. Low dietary phosphate: direct enhancement of kidney 1-OHase.
> 
> 3. Active growth in children: via growth hormone stimulation of 1-OHase.
> 
> 4. Pregnancy and lactation: estrogens and prolactin increase renal 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> output.

**Biochemical Mode of 1,25(OH)****<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> Action**:

The proposed mode of action for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> resembles the mode of action of the general class of thyroid/steroid hormones:

i) transport to nucleus

ii) mediation by a nuclear receptor

iii) stimulation of DNA transcription

iv) synthesis of functional proteins: Calcium Transporter (Ionophore), Ca-Binding Protein and Ca-ATPase.

**Clinical Correlate**(**s**):

**Rickets**- "a disease marked by soft deformed bones caused by vitamin D deficiency"

**Type I**:

> *Symptoms*- delayed walking, severe rickets
> 
> *Serum Chemistry*- low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, high PTH and phosphate, high 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, low 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>

> *Cause*- defective 1-OHase enzyme in kidney
> 
> *Treatment*- physiologic replacement doses of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>

**Type II**:

> *Symptoms*- rickets, bowing of lower extremities, hair loss
> 
> *Serum Chemistry*- low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, high PTH, normal 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and elevated 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>

> *Cause*- target tissue resistance to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, receptor or post-receptor defect
> 
> *Treatment*- mega doses of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>

**Osteoporosis**:

*Symptoms*-clinically significant loss of bone mass resulting in fractures of the vertebrae, wrist or hip

> **.** Affects over 27 million individuals in the U.S. and about 1.5 million fractures are . attributable to osteoporosis annually in people 45 and older.

> **.** Of those women who live to age 90, 32% will suffer hip fracture.

> **.** Cost of oteoporosis is $10 billion annually.

*Prevention*- adequate dietary calcium plus vitamin D, regular exercise, estrogen replacement for post-menopausal women.
