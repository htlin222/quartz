# WHO Histologic Classification of Classical HL

### Nodular sclerosis
60â€“80%
Collagen bands; frequent mediastinal LAN; young adults; female predominance; usually stage I or II at dx
Mixed cellularity
15â€“30%
Pleomorphic; older age; male predominance; â‰¥50% stage III or IV at presentation; intermediate prognosis
Lymphocyte rich
5%
Abundant normal-appearing lymphocytes; mediastinal LAN uncommon; male predominance; good prognosis
Lymphocyte depleted
<1%
Diffuse fibrosis and large numbers of RS cells; older, male patients; disseminated at dx; seen in HIV; worst prognosis
â€¢ Nonclassical HL (5%): nodular lymphocyte predominant (NLP); involves peripheral LN
80% present in stages Iâ€“II, Rx w/ RT vs. chemoRT w/ 4-yr PFS 88% and OS 96% (JCO 2008;26:434); consider rituximab because most NLP RS cells are CD20+
Stages IIIâ€“IV treated with combination chemo (see below)
