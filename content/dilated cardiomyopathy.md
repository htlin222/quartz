# dilated cardiomyopathy

## Definition and epidemiology (JACC 2016;67:2996; Lancet 2017;390:400)

- LV or biventricular dilatation and global ↓ contractility ± ↓ wall thickness in the absence of ischemia/infarct, valvular disease or HTN. Pts w/ prior MI complicated by LV dilation and ↓ EF are often termed “ischemic CMP.”

## [[etiologies of dilated cardiomyopathy]]

## Clinical manifestations

- Heart failure: both congestive & poor forward flow sx; signs of L- & R-sided HF

diffuse, laterally displaced PMI, S3, ± MR or TR (annular dilat., displaced pap. muscle)

- Embolic events (~10%), supraventricular/ventricular arrhythmias, & palpitations

## [[diagnostic studies and workup of dilated cardiomyopathy]]

## Treatment (see “Heart Failure” for standard HF Rx)

- Possibility of reversibility of CMP may temper implantation of devices

- Prognosis differs by etiology (NEJM 2000;342:1077):
  - postpartum (best),
  - ischemic/GCM (worst)
