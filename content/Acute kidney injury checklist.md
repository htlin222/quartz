# Acute kidney injury checklist

- confirm diagnosis and stage AKI
- send initial laboratory evaluation
- CBC, BMP, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and ABG or VBG
- urine studies: urinalysis, urine microscopy, urine chemistry (sodium, urea, osmolality, creatinine)
- consider urgent ultrasound and/or foley catheter placement (if urinary tract obstruction is suspected).
- optimize volume status.
- identify and treat any metabolic complications (e.g., acidosis, hyperkalemia).
- identify and treat the underlying cause.
- hold nephrotoxic medications and renally-dose other medications.
- strict input/output monitoring
- nutritional support
- consider early nephrology consult.
