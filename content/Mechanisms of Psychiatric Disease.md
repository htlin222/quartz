### Mechanisms of Psychiatric Disease

**â€¢**Â Â Â Mechanisms of psychiatric disease remain partially understood

**â€¢**Â Â Â Complementary mechanistic hypotheses exist for many disorders (e.g., dysfunction in the stress axis, altered glutamatergic neurotransmission, reduced GABAergic transmission, abnormal circadian rhythms, thyroxine abnormalities, etc.) and these data inform current psychopharmacotherapy (Table 13.1)


**TABLE 13.1** â€¢ Selected Psychiatric Diseases and Classically Associated Neurotransmitter Changes




**â€¢**Â Â Â Advanced imaging techniques offer increasingly refined descriptions of neurobiological mechanisms and can help uncover novel targets for advanced therapies such as deep brain stimulation or operative interventions (Figure 13.1)



**FIGURE 13.1:** Deep brain stimulation targets by psychiatric disease. Deep brain stimulation targets are selected based on historical ablation targets as well as emerging understandings of which neuroanatomical structures and tracts are involved in the pathophysiology of specific psychiatric diseases. Abbreviations: CM-PF, centromedian nucleus; GPi, globus pallidus internus; GPe, globus pallidus externus; OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder

**â€¢**Â Â Â Researchers have begun to use behavioral domains to characterize psychiatric disease (e.g., reframing obsessive compulsive disorder \[OCD\] as dysfunction of performance monitoring, response inhibition, goal selection, and reward learning), which may help refine therapeutic management in the future
