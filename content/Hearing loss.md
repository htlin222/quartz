# Hearing loss #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Hearing loss

â€¢Â Â Â **Physical exam:** Otoscopic exam, Weber test (performed by pressing the handle of the tuning fork to the center of the forehead), Rinne test (performed by comparing the sound heard when a tuning fork is placed on the mastoid bone behind the ear to when a tuning fork is held near the ear, in order to compare bone and air conduction)

â€¢Â Â Â **Differential diagnosis:**

-Â Â Â **Conductive hearing loss**

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Decreased perception of sound (especially low frequency), but often can still hear loud noises well

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies: Lesion in the external/middle ear

-Â Â Â External canal: Cerumen impaction, otitis externa, exostoses (bony outgrowths often due to cold water)

-Â Â Â Tympanic membrane: Perforation secondary to trauma/infection, clot in meatus, tear

-Â Â Â Middle ear: Effusion (otitis media, allergic rhinitis), otosclerosis (bony immobilization of stapes), neoplasm

â€¢Â Â Â Physical exam: **CARWA** â€“ **C**onductive hearing loss will have **A**bnormal **R**inne (bone conduction is better than air) and **W**eber with sound lateralizing to **A**ffected side (louder in bad ear)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis (no specific labs/imaging required)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat underlying cause, hearing aids, soften and irrigate cerumen, tympanoplasty if needed, stapedectomy for otosclerosis

-Â Â Â **Sensorineural hearing loss**

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Hearing loss; may have more difficulty with high frequency sounds

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies: Lesion in the cochlea or CN VIII (auditory branch)

-Â Â Â Presbycusis (most common): Gradual, symmetric hearing loss (especially at high frequencies) associated with aging, due to degeneration of the sensory cells at the base of the cochlea; most marked at high frequencies with slow progression to lower frequencies

-Â Â Â Noise-induced: Chronic loud noise damages hair cells in the organ of Corti

-Â Â Â Inflammatory/infectious: Infection (e.g., viral cochleitis), congenital infections, autoimmune hearing loss

-Â Â Â CNS: Acoustic neuromas (especially if marked hearing difference between ears), meningitis, multiple sclerosis, syphilis

-Â Â Â Drug-induced: Aminoglycoside antibiotics, furosemide, ethacrynic acid, cisplatin, quinidine, aspirin (tinnitus)

â€¢Â Â Â Physical exam: Normal Rinne test (air conduction better than bone); Weber test with sound lateralizing to the unaffected side (louder = good ear)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis (no specific labs/imaging required)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat underlying cause, hearing aids, cochlear implants
