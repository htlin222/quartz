* When evaluating a patient for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), it is important to measure the hematocrit, which may be normal in the first 24 hours of acute GIB before equilibration.
	* A 2-3% decrease in hematocrit may indicate a loss of 500 mL of blood.
* A low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) may suggest iron deficiency and chronic blood loss.
* Other laboratory tests that may be useful include
	* measuring the platelet count,
	* prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT),
	* [[blood urea nitrogen creatinine (BUN Cr) ratio]], which may be elevated in UGIB due to
		* the resorption of blood in the gastrointestinal tract or prerenal azotemia,
	* and liver function tests (LFTs).
