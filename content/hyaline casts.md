# hyaline casts

* Casts are clusters of urinary sediment elements 
* (red blood cells, white blood cells, fat bodies, etc.) wrapped in a protein matrix. 
* Cast formation necessarily occurs in the kidney tubules, 
* and the the contents of the casts indicate the nature of the abnormalities occurring in the kidney itself.
* Hyaline casts are the only casts that should be observed in normal urine and are not of particular clinical interest. 
* They can be observed after intense exercise, in very concentrated low-volume urine, or during diuretic treatment.
