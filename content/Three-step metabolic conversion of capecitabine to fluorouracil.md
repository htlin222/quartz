- Capecitabine needs three activation steps to become its active form FU.

1. It is → absorbed in the intestine
2. and converted to 5'-DFCR by carboxylesterase,
3. then → to 5'-DFUR by cytidine deaminase in the liver.

- Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) converts 5'-DFUR to the active drug, FU.
  - 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, which is → a prodrug of the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
- TP is → found at ↣ higher concentrations in most tumor tissue compared to normal healthy tissue.
- The activation of capecitabine occurs in both tumor and normal tissues.
