# Differential Diagnosis of Cellulitis

## Stasis dermatitis	
* Bilateral leg involvement; circumferential erythema and swelling; usually no fevers
* 雙腿；周圍紅斑和腫脹;通常不發燒
 
## Contact dermatitis	
* Unusual patterns of distribution; pruritus; no fevers

## Inflammatory arthritis	
Erythema overlies a joint; pain with range of motion

## Deep venous thrombosis/ thrombophlebitis	
Deep pain in calf; linear venous cord; usually no fevers

## Hypersensitivity/drug reaction	
* History of medication, allergen, insect bite exposure; erythema doesn’t spread as fast as cellulitis
* 用藥史、過敏原、昆蟲叮咬史；紅斑的傳播速度不如蜂窩織炎
## Pyoderma gangrenosum	
* Nodular, bullous, ulcerated lesions; usually on anterior shin; often associated with inflammatory bowel disease or collagen vascular syndromes
* 結節性，大皰性，潰瘍性病變；
* 通常在前脛骨上；通常與ulcerative colitis 或collagen vasuclar syndrome
