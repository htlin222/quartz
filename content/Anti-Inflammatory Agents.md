### Anti-Inflammatory Agents

##### NSAIDS

â€¢Â Â Â Mechanism: Decreased prostaglandin production and thus reduced prostaglandin-mediated capillary leakage and inflammatory cell recruitment. Most NSAIDs are non-selective inhibitors of both cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX1 and COX2).

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical use: Analgesic only in most rheumatologic diseases

â€¢Â Â Â Side effects: GI bleed, hypertension, hyperkalemia, AKI (ATN from inappropriate afferent arteriole constriction or tubulointerstitial nephritis)

##### Glucocorticoids

â€¢Â Â Â Mechanism: Suppress antibody production by B cells; promote T cell apoptosis; inhibit inflammatory chemokine/cytokine production and antigen presentation by myeloid cells

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical use: Rapid suppression of acute disease activity in RA, SLE, gout/pseudogout, inflammatory myopathies, PMR, etc. (1 mg/kg = common initial dose for organ-threatening rheumatologic disease)

-Â Â Â PJP prophylaxis should be provided for all patients on â‰¥20 mg prednisone daily for â‰¥3 weeks

-Â Â Â Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis:

**â€¢**Â Â Â All patients on â‰¥2.5 mg prednisone â‰¥3 months should take oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation

**â€¢**Â Â Â For patients >40 yr old on â‰¥2.5 mg prednisone â‰¥3 months: Check DEXA. If DEXA indicates moderate to high risk for fracture based on FRAX score, consider bisphosphonate therapy

â€¢Â Â Â Side effects: Immunosuppression, osteoporosis, skin thinning, glaucoma, cataracts, weight gain, DM2, hypertension, mania/altered mental status, avascular necrosis, HPA axis suppression

##### Colchicine

â€¢Â Â Â Mechanism: Impairs microtubule polymerization, and thus impairs neutrophil function

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical use: Gout, pseudogout, familial Mediterranean fever, hypersensitivity vasculitis

â€¢Â Â Â Side effects: Diarrhea, neuromuscular toxicity especially when co-administered with statins. Dose reduction needed for CKD
