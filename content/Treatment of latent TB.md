Scenario - Prophylaxis Regimen

## PPD/IGRA ⊕ (regardless of HIV status)

- 1st line:
  - Rifampin × 4 mo or
  - INH/rifampin daily x 3 mos or
  - INH/rifapentine weekly × 12 wks) (MMWR 2020; 69:1)
- Alternative: INH + vitamin B6 × 6–9 mos

## Contact case known or suspected to have MDR TB

- No proven regimen: ? PZA + EMB, ? PZA + FQ
- ✓ LFTs monthly if receiving INH
  - (risk ↑ w/ age; Chest 2005;128:116): if AST/ALT ↑ 5× ULN or sx (nausea, vomiting, abd pain)
