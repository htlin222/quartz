7. Comparison of two groups:

| Outcome | Durvalumab Group | Placebo Group |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Progression-free survival (median duration, months) | 17.2 | 5.6 |
| Progression-free survival (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death) | 0.51 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63) | Not reported |
| Overall survival (24-month rate, %) | 66.3 (95% CI, 61.7 to 70.4) | 55.6 (95% CI, 48.9 to 61.8) |
