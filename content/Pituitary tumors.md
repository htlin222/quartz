# Pituitary tumors

- Pathophysiology:
  - adenoma → excess of trophic hormone (if tumor fxnal, but 30–40% not) and potentially deficiencies in other trophic hormones due to compression;
  - cosecretion of PRL and growth hormone in 10% of prolactinomas
- Clinical manifestations:
  - specific syndromes due to oversecretion of hormones (see below) ±
  - non-specific mass effect:
    - headache,
    - visual Δs,
    - diplopia,
    - cranial neuropathies
- Workup:
  - MRI brain pituitary protocol,
  - hormone levels,
  - ± visual field testing if <10 mm,
  - no mass effect,
  - no hormone overproduction,
  - can f/up in 12 mos
