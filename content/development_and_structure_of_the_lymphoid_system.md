# development_and_structure_of_the_lymphoid_system

- **Lymphatic System**:

  - A complex, **blind-ended vascular network** distinct from the blood circulatory system.
  - It plays essential roles in:
    - **Tissue fluid homeostasis**
    - **Nutrient uptake**
    - **Immune function regulation**

- **Lymphatic Vessels & Endothelial Cells**:

  - Lymphatic vessels exhibit unique features aiding in:
    - **Uptake of substances**
    - **Transport back to the blood circulation**
  - **Lymphatic endothelial cells** are specialized and their:
    - **Specification** and **differentiation** are controlled by molecular programs.
    - **Heterogeneity** and **plasticity** lead to the creation of tissue- and organ-specific vascular beds.

- **Lymph Nodes**:

  - Lymph nodes are complex structures containing unique layers of endothelial cells.
  - Function as **key immune surveillance centers**.

- **Lymphatics in Cancer**:

  - Present in the **tumor microenvironment**, actively involved in tumor metastasis.
  - **Tumor-associated lymphatic vessels** have distinct molecular profiles compared to normal lymphatics.
  - **Crosstalk between tumors and lymphatic vessels** significantly contributes to:
    - **Cancer progression**
    - **Metastasis**

- **Key Growth Factors**:

  - **VEGFC** and **VEGFD** are major growth factors that attract **VEGFR3-expressing lymphatic endothelial cells**, accelerating **tumor lymphangiogenesis**.

- **Current Knowledge Gaps**:
  - Most research is limited to specific cancer types such as:
    - **Melanoma**
    - **Breast cancer**
    - **Glioblastomas**
  - More exploration is needed across other cancer types.
