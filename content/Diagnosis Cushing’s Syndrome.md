# Diagnosis Cushingâ€™s Syndrome

- Typically performed in outPt setting
- Very difficult as inPt b/c hypercortisolism from acute illness and hosp.
  (NEJM 2017;376:1451)

![Approach to suspected Cushingâ€™s syndrome](https://i.imgur.com/HUuyl7W.png)

- suspect [[Cushingâ€™s Syndrome]] Clinically
- [[3 options for screening for hypercortisolism]]
- Results:
  - negative and low clinical suspicion of hypercortisolism
  - positive and high clinical suspicion hypercortisolism
    - âœ… 24-hr UFC again
  - positive but pt w/ acute illness, alcohol, depression
    - re âœ… after resolution of illness or
    - âœ… combined
      - [[48-hr LD-dexamethasone suppression test]]
      - [[CRH stimulations test]]
- if positive:

## Differentiate level of defect by checking serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone

> âœ… ACTH level

### adrenocorticotrophic hormone dependent

- 48-hr or Overnight high-dose DST (or CRH test)
  - will not suppress or negative stimulations
    - chest/abdominal CT
    - [[somatostatin scan]]
      - negative -> [[BIPSS]]
  - will suppress or positive stimulations
    - pituitary MRI
      - positive -> [[Cushingâ€™s disease]]
      - negative -> [[BIPSS]]
  - BIPSS
    - positive -> [[Cushingâ€™s disease]]
    - negative -> Ectopic ACTH

### adrenocorticotrophic hormone independent

- adrenal computed tomogram or magnetic resonance imaging
- Adrenal tumor

- O/N HD DST = 8 mg at 11 p.m.; âœ“ 9 a.m. serum cortisol (suppression if <50% from day prior)
