# top 10 take-home messages for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease

1. The most important way to prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation is to promote a healthy lifestyle throughout life.
2. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions.
3. Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [[ASCVD risk estimation]] and have a
clinician-patient risk discussion before starting on
pharmacological therapy, such as antihyperten-
sive therapy, a statin, or aspirin. The presence or
absence of additional risk-enhancing factors can
help guide decisions about preventive interven-
tions in select individuals, as can coronary artery
calcium scanning
4. All adults should consume a healthy diet that
emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts,
whole grains, lean vegetable or animal protein,
and fish and minimizes the intake of trans fats, red
meat and processed red meats, refined carbohy-
drates, and sweetened beverages. For adults with
overweight and obesity, counseling and caloric
restriction are recommended for achieving and
maintaining weight loss.
5. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per
week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical
activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-inten-
sity physical activity.
6. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lifestyle
changes, such as improving dietary habits and
achieving exercise recommendations are crucial.
If medication is indicated, metformin is first-line
therapy, followed by consideration of a sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or a glucagon-
like peptide-1 receptor agonist.
7. All adults should be assessed at every healthcare
visit for tobacco use, and those who use tobacco
should be assisted and strongly advised to quit.
8. Aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine
primary prevention of ASCVD because of lack of
net benefit.
9. Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary
prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (â‰¥190
mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40
to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at
sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician-patient risk
discussion.
10. Nonpharmacological interventions are recom-
mended for all adults with elevated blood pressure
or hypertension. For those requiring pharmaco-
logical therapy, the target blood pressure should
generally be <130/80 mm Hg.
