# Principles of Imaging in Vasculitides

## for large- and certain medium-vessel vasculitides, various imaging techniques can be useful
* magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) allow for the assessment of
	* extensive vascular territories
	* vessels not readily accessible for tissue biopsy
* ultrasound, particularly color-coded duplex sonography, is often used as first-line imaging in patients with suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA)
 
## small-vessel vasculitides 
* difficult to directly visualize with imaging 
* indirect signs can be detected; 
* this may play a role in evaluating disease activity and extent of involvement
