### Miscellaneous

•   Milaria (“heat rash”): Numerous non-follicular papules or pustules; caused by occlusion of the sweat ducts. Treatment: Removal of occluding agents

•   Transient acantholytic dermatosis (Grover disease): Discrete pruritic papulovesicles on the trunk and back; especially common in older Caucasian men. Treatment: Moisturizers and topical glucocorticoids

•   Vitiligo: Autoimmune condition resulting in the absence or loss of function of melanocytes; presents as well-demarcated depigmented macules and patches; associated with type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease. Treatment: Topical glucocorticoids, phototherapy

•   Venous stasis ulcer: Most common cause of leg ulceration (~70% of cases); presents as irregularly shaped shallow ulcers on the lower extremities; often occurs with other findings to suggest chronic venous stasis, including edema, eczematous change, hyperpigmentation, and varicosities. Treatment: Leg elevation, compression therapy, wound care

•   Arterial insufficiency ulcer: Less common cause of leg ulceration (~25% of cases); presents as painful, sharply demarcated ulcers with a “punched out” appearance. Diagnosis: Ankle-brachial index. Treatment: Wound care and surgical revascularization
