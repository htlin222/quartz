  {"id":"_interleukin6_2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND The efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is unclear.\nMETHODS We evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours after starting organ support in the intensive care unit (ICU), were randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight), sarilumab (400 mg), or standard care (control). The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support‚Äìfree days, on an ordinal scale combining in-hospital death (assigned a value of ‚àí1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with predefined criteria for superiority, efficacy, equivalence, or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support‚Äìfree days, or both.\nRESULTS Both tocilizumab and sarilumab met the predefined criteria for efficacy. At that time, 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab, and 402 to control. The median number of organ support‚Äìfree days was 10 (interquartile range, ‚àí1 to 16) in the tocilizumab group, 11 (interquartile range, 0 to 16) in the sarilumab group, and 0 (interquartile range, ‚àí1 to 15) in the control group. The median adjusted cumulative odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95% credible interval, 1.17 to 2.91) for sarilumab as compared with control, yielding posterior probabilities of superiority to control of more than 99.9% and of 99.5%, respectively. An analysis of 90-day survival showed improved survival in the pooled interleukin-6 receptor antagonist groups, yielding a hazard ratio for the comparison with the control group of 1.61 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.08) and a posterior probability of superiority of more than 99.9%. All secondary analyses supported efficacy of these interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. The members of the writing committee (A.C. Gordon, P.R. Mouncey, F. Al‚ÄëBeidh, K.M. Rowan, A.D. Nichol, Y.M.

The drugs available through the National Health Insurance include fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, tegafur-uracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, bevacizumab, and cetuximab. Progress has been made in the treatment of colorectal cancer since the 1960s with the use of 5-FU bolus monotherapy, including the development of drug combinations such as FOLFOX (FOLinic acid, Fluorouracil, OXaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (Folinic acid, 5-FU, IRInotecan), which not only improve response rates but also extend overall survival. The combination of monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab and cetuximab has also brought significant benefits to certain patients. In addition, the development of oral formulations and special infusion devices allows patients to conveniently and effectively undergo chemotherapy at home. The future direction of development is towards personalized gene therapy, where pre-genetic testing can improve diagnosis precision and treatment effectiveness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"","given":"ÊûóÁéâËêç"}],"citation-key":"_JieChangZhiChangAiDeYaoWuZhiLiao_","language":"zh-Hant-TW","title":"ÁµêËÖ∏Áõ¥ËÖ∏ÁôåÁöÑËó•Áâ©Ê≤ªÁôÇ","type":"document","URL":"https://www.taiwan-pharma.org.tw/magazine/120/017.pdf"},

  {"id":"_lisocabtagene_2023","abstract":"This global phase 3 study compared lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) with a standard of care (SOC) as second-line therapy for primary refractory or early relapsed (ÔøΩÔøΩ12 months) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Adults eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT; N = 184) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to liso-cel (100 ÔøΩ 106 chimeric antigen receptor-positive T cells) or SOC (3 cycles of platinum-based immunochemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT in responders). The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS). In this primary analysis with a 17.5-month median follow-up, median EFS was not reached (NR) for liso-cel vs 2.4 months for SOC. Complete response (CR) rate was 74% for liso-cel vs 43% for SOC (P < .0001) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was NR for liso-cel vs 6.2 months for SOC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.400; P < .0001). Median overall survival (OS) was NR for liso-cel vs 29.9 months for SOC (HR = 0.724; P = .0987). When adjusted for crossover from SOC to liso-cel, 18-month OS rates were 73% for liso-cel and 54% for SOC (HR = 0.415). Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in 1% and 4% of patients in the liso-cel arm, respectively (no grade 4 or 5 events). These data show significant improvements in EFS, CR rate, and PFS for liso-cel compared with SOC and support liso-cel as a preferred second-line treatment compared with SOC in patients with primary refractory or early relapsed LBCL.

  {"id":"a_international_2022","abstract":"The classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias was last updated in 2016 within a collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO), the Society for Hematopathology, and the European Association for Haematopathology. This collaboration was primarily based on input from a clinical advisory committees (CACs) composed of pathologists, hematologists, oncologists, geneticists, and bioinformaticians from around the world. The recent advances in our understanding of the biology of hematologic malignancies, the experience with the use of the 2016 WHO classification in clinical practice, and the results of clinical trials have indicated the need for further revising and updating the classification. As a continuation of this CAC-based process, the authors, a group with expertise in the clinical, pathologic, and genetic aspects of these disorders, developed the International Consensus Classification (ICC) of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias. Using a multiparameter approach, the main objective of the consensus process was the definition of real disease entities, including the introduction of new entities and refined criteria for existing diagnostic categories, based on accumulated data. The ICC is aimed at facilitating diagnosis and prognostication of these neoplasms, improving treatment of affected patients, and allowing the design of innovative clinical trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"A","given":"rber Daniel A."},{"family":"O","given":"razi Attilio"},{"family":"H","given":"asserjian Robert P."},{"family":"B","given":"orowitz Michael J."},{"family":"C","given":"alvo Katherine R."},{"family":"K","given":"vasnicka Hans-Michael"},{"family":"W","given":"ang Sa A."},{"family":"B","given":"agg Adam"},{"family":"B","given":"arbui Tiziano"},{"family":"B","given":"ranford Susan"},{"family":"B","given":"ueso-Ramos Carlos E."},{"family":"C","given":"ortes Jorge E."},{"family":"D","given":"al Cin Paola"},{"family":"D","given":"iNardo Courtney D."},{"family":"D","given":"ombret Herv√©"},{"family":"D","given":"uncavage Eric J."},{"family":"E","given":"bert Benjamin L."},{"family":"E","given":"stey Elihu H."},{"family":"F","given":"acchetti Fabio"},{"family":"F","given":"oucar Kathryn"},{"family":"G","given":"angat Naseema"},{"family":"G","given":"ianelli Umberto"},{"family":"G","given":"odley Lucy A."},{"family":"G","given":"√∂kbuget Nicola"},{"family":"G","given":"otlib Jason"},{"family":"H","given":"ellstr√∂m-Lindberg Eva"},{"family":"H","given":"obbs Gabriela S."},{"family":"H","given":"offman Ronald"},{"family":"J","given":"abbour Elias J."},{"family":"K","given":"iladjian Jean-Jacques"},{"family":"L","given":"arson Richard A."},{"family":"L","given":"e Beau Michelle M."},{"family":"L","given":"oh Mignon L.-C."},{"family":"L","given":"√∂wenberg Bob"},{"family":"M","given":"acintyre Elizabeth"},{"family":"M","given":"alcovati Luca"},{"family":"M","given":"ullighan Charles G."},{"family":"N","given":"iemeyer Charlotte"},{"family":"O","given":"denike Olatoyosi M."},{"family":"O","given":"gawa Seishi"},{"family":"O","given":"rfao Alberto"},{"family":"P","given":"apaemmanuil Elli"},{"family":"P","given":"assamonti Francesco"},{"family":"P","given":"orkka Kimmo"},{"family":"P","given":"ui Ching-Hon"},{"family":"R","given":"adich Jerald P."},{"family":"R","given":"eiter Andreas"},{"family":"R","given":"ozman Maria"},{"family":"R","given":"udelius Martina"},{"family":"S","given":"avona Michael R."},{"family":"S","given":"chiffer Charles A."},{"family":"S","given":"chmitt-Graeff Annette"},{"family":"S","given":"himamura Akiko"},{"family":"S","given":"ierra Jorge"},{"family":"S","given":"tock Wendy A."},{"family":"S","given":"tone Richard M."},{"family":"T","given":"allman Martin S."},{"family":"T","given":"hiele J√ºrgen"},{"family":"T","given":"ien Hwei-Fang"},{"family":"T","given":"zankov Alexandar"},{"family":"V","given":"annucchi Alessandro M."},{"family":"V","given":"yas Paresh"},{"family":"W","given":"ei Andrew H."},{"family":"W","given":"einberg Olga K."},{"family":"W","given":"ierzbowska Agnieszka"},{"family":"C","given":"azzola Mario"},{"family":"D","given":"√∂hner Hartmut"},{"family":"T","given":"efferi Ayalew"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"a_international_2022","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2022015850","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1200-1228","source":"20.3","title":"International consensus classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias: integrating morphologic, clinical, and genomic data","title-short":"International Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2022015850","volume":"140"},

Several risk factors for developing VTE also coexist with cancer patients, such as chemotherapy and immobilisation, contributing to the increased risk cancer patients have of developing VTE compared with non-cancer patients. Cancer cells are capable of activating the coagulation cascade and other prothrombotic properties of host cells, and many anticancer treatments themselves are being described as additional mechanisms for promoting VTE. This review will give an overview of the main thrombotic complications in cancer patients and outline the risk factors for cancer patients developing cancer-associated thrombosis, focusing on VTE as it is the most common complication observed in cancer patients. The multiple mechanisms involved in cancer-associated thrombosis, including the role of anticancer drugs, and a brief outline of the current treatment for cancer-associated thrombosis will also be discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdol Razak","given":"Norbaini"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Gabrielle"},{"family":"Bhandari","given":"Mayank"},{"family":"Berndt","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Metharom","given":"Pat"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"abdolrazak_cancerassociated_2018","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers10100380","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"language":"en","page":"380","source":"6.575","title":"Cancer-Associated Thrombosis: An Overview of Mechanisms, Risk Factors, and Treatment","title-short":"Cancer-Associated Thrombosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/10/10/380","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"adam_case_2015","abstract":"Background: Nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) are Gram-positive cocci characterized by their dependence on pyridoxal or cysteine supplementation for growth in standard blood culture media. They are responsible for severe infections in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts, including infective endocarditis (IE). NVS have been divided into two different genera, Granulicatella and Abiotrophia.\nMethods: We report four cases of IE caused by Granulicatella species, including clinical presentation, echocardiographic characteristics, treatments received, and outcomes. We also performed a literature search for previously reported cases of IE caused by Granulicatella species to better characterize this condition.\nResults: A total of 29 cases of Granulicatella endocarditis were analyzed, including the four newly reported cases. The aortic (44%) and mitral (38%) valves were those most commonly affected. Multivalvular involvement was observed in 13% of cases. The mean vegetation length was 16 mm. Complications were frequent, including heart failure (30%), embolism (30%), and perivalvular abscess (11%). The most frequent antibiotic regimen (85%) was penicillin or one of its derivatives plus gentamicin. The mortality rate was 17%.\nConclusions: Endocarditis due to Granulicatella species is a rare and severe condition. Complications are frequent despite the use of appropriate antibiotic regimens. √ü 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) is a first-in-class anti-trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 ADC approved for pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) gained approval for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive advanced BC (aBC). We aim to provide a contemporary review and the current clinical trial landscape of SG and T-DXd in BC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature search from Medline database through PubMed, major conference proceedings [abstracts from European Society for Medical Oncology (Breast) Congress, American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium] and ClinicalTrials.gov with search terms 'sacituzumab govitecan', 'IMMU-132', 'trastuzumab deruxtecan' and 'DS-8201a' up to 21 March¬†2021.\nRESULTS: We assessed 293 records for eligibility, of which 153 were included in this review after screening and exclusion. For SG, efficacy and safety data are available from a phase III trial in pretreated mTNBC and from a phase I/II basket study in mTNBC and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative aBC. Thirteen trials with pending primary analysis are ongoing with SG as single agent or in combination, of which 11 are enrolling (2/11 in the early setting). For T-DXd, efficacy/safety data are available as single agent in pretreated HER2-positive (phase Ib and phase II) and in HER2-low aBC (phase Ib), and in combination with nivolumab in HER2-low/positive aBC (phase Ib). Of 23 ongoing trials with T-DXd, 12 are open for enrollment and 3 phase III trials have completed recruitment. The distinct safety profiles of both drugs and their management are discussed.\nCONCLUSION: Given their robust single-agent activity, SG and T-DXd are expected to substantially impact treatment standards, both in and far beyond the currently approved indications. Several trials are investigating new treatment settings for both drugs, including a transition to earlier lines and combinations with other anticancer treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"E."},{"family":"Wildiers","given":"H."},{"family":"Neven","given":"P."},{"family":"Punie","given":"K."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"adams_sacituzumab_2021","container-title":"ESMO Open","container-title-short":"ESMO Open","DOI":"10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100204","ISSN":"2059-7029","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100204","PMCID":"PMC8259232","PMID":"34225076","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"6.883","title":"Sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan: two new antibody‚Äìdrug conjugates in the breast cancer treatment landscape","title-short":"Sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.esmoopen.com/article/S2059-7029(21)00165-4/fulltext","volume":"6"},

These adverse events were deemed acceptable by the NCI and FDA and the study re-opened. A total of 25 eligible pts were accrued. The median age was 73 years (range 62-87). All pts were newly diagnosed. One pt was Ph-like, with the remainder being Ph+; 89% of Ph+ pts had additional cytogenetic abnormalities. During induction, 2 pts experienced treatment-related non-hematologic Grade 4 toxicities. No Grade 4 or higher treatment-related non-hematologic toxicities occurred during post-remission therapy or maintenance. Twenty-three out of 25 pts (92%) achieved a CR during dasatinib-based and prednisone induction therapy. Four did not receive PRT (2 due to adverse events, 1 to receive transplant, 1 because of insurance issues). Sixteen pts who achieved CR had MRD data. Five out of 16 pts (31%) were MRD negative at Day 28. One pt remains on PRT and 10 are on maintenance. The median follow up for pts who are alive is 1.7 years. The median overall survival (OS) and DFS have not been reached as of July 8, 2021. Kaplan-Meier 3-year estimates of OS and DFS are 85% (95% CI 58%-95%) and 80% (95% CI 55%-92%), respectively (Figure).</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Conclusions: This trial demonstrates the feasibility of combining dasatinib and blinatumomab in Ph+ ALL. In addition, with 1.7 years of follow up, outcomes are encouraging with high estimated 3-year DFS and OS. Longer follow up will be needed to determine the durability of these results.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Figure 1 Figure 1.</jats:p>\n<jats:p />\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Advani:ÔøΩ†Éãite Pharmaceuticals: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding; Abbvie: Research Funding; Glycomimetics: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding; Immunogen: Research Funding; OBI: Research Funding; Seattle Genetics: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding; Pfizer: Honoraria, Research Funding; Macrogenics: Research Funding; Amgen: Membership on an entity's Board of Directors or advisory committees, Research Funding.

In part A, patients who had progressed on a previous EGFR TKI received osimertinib (80 mg once daily) plus durvalumab 3 or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In part B, patients received first-line osimertinib plus durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. However, part B enrollment was terminated early owing to an increased incidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD)-related adverse events (AEs). Safety (primary objective) and preliminary anti-tumor activity determined by objective response rate (ORR), best overall response, duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival were evaluated.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">Before enrollment termination, 23 and 11 patients received treatment across parts A and B, respectively. The most common AEs across parts A and B were as follows: diarrhea (50%), nausea (41%), and decreased appetite (35%). A total of 12 patients (35%) reported ILD-related AEs (lung disorder, ILD or pneumonitis). In part A, ORR was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23-66); median DOR was 20.4 months.

  {"id":"ai_chemotherapyinduced_2023","abstract":"Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is a common condition that frequently results in reduced chemotherapy dosages, postponed treatment, bleeding, and unfavorable oncological outcomes. At present, there is no clear suggestions for preventing or treating CIT. Thrombopoietin (TPO) replacement therapy has been invented and used to treat CIT to promote the production of megakaryocytes and stimulate the formation of platelets. However, this treatment is limited to the risk of immunogenicity and cancer progression. Therefore, an unmet need exists for exploring alternatives to TPO to address the clinical issue of CIT. Application of appropriate therapeutic drugs may be due to understanding the potential mechanisms of CIT. Studies have shown that chemotherapy significantly affects various cells in bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, reduces their ability to support normal hematopoiesis, and may lead to BM damage, including CIT in cancer patients. This review focuses on the epidemiology and treatment of cancer patients with CIT. We also introduce some recent progress to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy inhibiting normal hematopoiesis and causing thrombocytopenia.","author":[{"family":"Ai","given":""},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Linlin"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Diansheng Gao"}],"citation-key":"ai_chemotherapyinduced_2023","container-title":"Discover.

Although the combination of chemotherapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is now considered the standard of care in patients with Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, little is known about the impact of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs). Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated 1375 adult patients who underwent their first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the TKI era. In this study, 224 patients had ACAs (16.3%). The ACAs that were seen in more than 20 cases (1.5%) were as follows: -7, der(22), der(9), +8, and +X. Overall survival at 4 years was 56.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.4% to 63.7%) in the group with ACAs and 60.5% (95% CI, 57.3% to 63.5%) in the group without ACAs (PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.266). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 4 years was 28.9% (95% CI, 22.6% to 35.6%) in the group with ACAs and 21.9% (95% CI, 19.4% to 24.6%) in the group with Ph alone (PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.051). In multivariate analyses there were no statistically significant differences in the risk of overall mortality or risk of relapse between the groups with and without ACAs. In the subgroup analyses of specific ACAs, although the presence of +8 was associated with a higher relapse rate in univariate and multivariate analyses, no specific ACA was associated with poor overall survival.

Objective To explore the efficacy and safety of osimertinib plus bevacizumab compared with osimertinib alone in patients with lung adenocarcinoma withEGFRT790M mutation. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma that progressed with prior EGFR-TKI treatment (other than third-generation TKI) and acquiredEGFR T790M mutation were enrolled. This study comprises a lead-in part with 6 patients and a subsequent phase 2 part. In phase 2, patients were randomized to osimertinib plus bevacizumab or osimertinib alone in a 1:1 ratio. Interventions The combination arm received oral osimertinib (80 mg, every day) plus intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The control arm received osimertinib monotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by investigators. Secondary end points consisted of overall response rate, time to treatment failure, overall survival, and safety. Results From August 2017 through September 2018, a total of 87 patients were registered (6 in the lead-in part and 81 in the phase 2 part [intention-to-treat population]). Among those randomized, the median (range) age was 68 (41-82) years; 33 (41%) were male; 37 (46%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0; and 21 (26%) had brain metastasis. Although the overall response rate was better with osimertinib plus bevacizumab than osimertinib alone (68% vs 54%), median PFS was not longer with osimertinib plus bevacizumab (9.4 months vs 13.5 months; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.44; 80% CI, 1.00 to 2.08;P = .20). Median time to treatment failure was also shorter in the combination arm vs the osimertinib arm (8.4 months vs 11.2 months;P = .12). Median overall survival was not different in the combination arm vs osimertinib arm (not reached vs 22.1 months;P = .96). In the combination arm, common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were proteinuria (n = 9; 23%), hypertension (n = 8; 20%). Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial comparing osimertinib plus bevacizumab vs osimertinib alone, the combination arm failed to show prolongation of PFS in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma withEGFR T790M mutation.

  {"id":"alderuccio_how_2023","abstract":"Secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (SCNSL) is a rare but clinically challenging scenario with historically disappointing outcomes. SCNSL refers to lymphoma that has spread into the CNS concurrently with systemic disease or CNS relapse during or after frontline immunochemotherapy, presenting with or without systemic lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) denotes the most common entity, but an increased incidence is observed in other histologies, such as Burkitt lymphoma and mantle-cell lymphoma. The incidence, timing in disease course, location, evidence supporting the use of CNS prophylaxis, and treatment pathways vary according to histology. No randomized data exist to delineate the best treatment approaches with current recommendations based on retrospective and single-arm studies. However, a regimen comprising immunochemotherapy, incorporating agents that cross the blood-brain barrier, followed by thiotepa-containing conditioning and autologous stem-cell transplant outlined in the international MARIETTA study demonstrated improvement in outcomes, representing a major accomplishment in the care of patients with DLBCL with SCNSL. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cell denotes a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with systemic aggressive lymphomas, with emerging data also demonstrating efficacy without higher neurotoxicity in those with SCNSL.

  {"id":"aldoss_impact_2015","abstract":"Abstract The occurrence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs) is common in Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) but is of unknown significance in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era. We retrospectively analyzed data from a consecutive case series of adults with Ph+ ALL who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) at City of Hope between 2003 and 2014. Among 130 adults with Ph+ ALL who had TKI therapy before alloHCT, 78 patients had available data on conventional cytogenetics at diagnosis and were eligible for outcomes analysis. ACAs were observed in 41 patients (53%). There were no statistically significant differences in median age, median initial WBC count, post-HCT TKI maintenance, or disease status at the time of transplant between the Ph-only and ACA cohorts; however, the Ph-only cohort had a higher rate of minimal residual disease positivity at the time of HCT. Three-year leukemia-free survival (79.8% versus 39.5%, PÔøΩ= .01) and 3-year overall survival (83% versus 45.6%, PÔøΩ= .02) were superior in the Ph-only cohort compared with the ACA cohort, respectively. Monosomy 7 was the most common additional aberration observed in our ACA cohort (nÔøΩ= 12). Thus, when TKI therapy and alloHCT are used as part of adult Ph+ ALL therapy, the presence of ACAs appears to have a significant deleterious effect on outcomes post-HCT.","author":[{"family":"Aldoss","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"Stiller","given":"Tracey"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Thai"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Joycelynne"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Sandra H."},{"family":"Forman","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Pullarkat","given":"Vinod"}],"citation-key":"aldoss_impact_2015","container-title":"Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","container-title-short":"Biol. blood marrow transplant. : j.

  {"id":"alessandrino_optimal_2013","abstract":"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only curative treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but involves non-negligible morbidity and mortality. Registry studies have shown that advanced disease stage at transplantation is associated with inferior overall survival. To define the optimal timing of allogeneic HSCT, we carried out a decision analysis by studying 660 patients who received best supportive care and 449 subjects who underwent transplantation. Risk assessment was based on both the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and the World Health Organization classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS). We used a continuous-time multistate Markov model to describe the natural history of disease and evaluate the effect of allogeneic HSCT on survival. This model estimated life expectancy from diagnosis according to treatment policy at different risk stages. Relative to supportive care, estimated life expectancy increased when transplantation was delayed from the initial stages until progression to intermediate-1 IPSS-risk or to intermediate WPSS-risk stage, and then decreased for higher risks. Modeling decision analysis on WPSS versus IPSS allowed better estimation of the optimal timing of transplantation. These observations indicate that allogeneic HSCT offers optimal survival benefits when the procedure is performed before MDS patients progress to advanced disease stages. Am. J.

  {"id":"alhamed_comprehensive_2021","abstract":"Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is among the more common and more severe of the amyloidoses usually involving the slow proliferation of a bone-marrow-residing plasma cell (PC) clone and the secretion of unstable immunoglobulin-free light chains (FLC) that infiltrate peripheral tissues and result in detrimental end-organ damage. Disease presentation is rather vague, and the hallmark of treatment is early diagnosis before irreversible end-organ damage. Once diagnosed, treatment decision is transplant-driven whereby ~20% of patients are eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with or without bortezomib-based induction. In the setting of ASCT-ineligibility, bortezomib plays a central role in upfront treatment with the recent addition of daratumumab to the current emerging standard of care. In general, management of AL amyloidosis is aimed at achieving deep, durable responses with very close monitoring for early detection of relapse/refractory disease.

Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving monoclonal antibodies together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with cetuximab and/or bevacizumab in treating patients with colorectal cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology","given":""}],"citation-key":"allianceforclinicaltrialsinoncology_phase_2020","contributor":[{"literal":"National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"literal":"SWOG Cancer Research Network"},{"literal":"Bristol-Myers Squibb"},{"literal":"Aptuit"}],"genre":"Clinical trial registration","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,28]]},"number":"NCT00265850","publisher":"clinicaltrials.gov","source":"clinicaltrials.gov","submitted":{"date-parts":[["2005",12,14]]},"title":"A Phase III Trial of Irinotecan / 5-FU / Leucovorin or Oxaliplatin / 5-FU/ Leucovorin With Bevacizumab, or Cetuximab (C225), or With the Combination of Bevacizumab and Cetuximab for Patients With Untreated Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Colon or Rectum","title-short":"Cetuximab and/or Bevacizumab Combined With Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","type":"report","URL":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00265850"},

Given the heterogeneity of PTLD and the risk of infectious complications in patients with immunosuppression, the treatment of this disease remains challenging. Monomorphic PTLD and lymphoma of B-cell origin account for the majority of cases. Treatment strategies for PTLD consist of response-adapted, risk-stratified methods using immunosuppression reduction, immunotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. With this approach, ‚àº25% of the patients do not need chemotherapy. Outcomes for patients with high risk or those who do not respond to frontline therapies remain dismal, and novel treatments are needed in this setting. PTLD is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in 60% to 80% of cases, making EBV-directed therapy an attractive treatment modality. Recently, the introduction of adoptive immunotherapies has become a promising option for refractory cases; hopefully, these treatment strategies can be used as earlier lines of therapy in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Amengual","given":"Jennifer E."},{"family":"Pro","given":"Barbara"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"amengual_how_2023","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2023020075","ISSN":"0006-4971, 1528-0020","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,26]]},"language":"en","page":"1426-1437","source":"20.3","title":"How I treat posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/142/17/1426/497352/How-I-treat-posttransplant-lymphoproliferative","volume":"142"},
  {"id":"amin_wide_2023","abstract":"With the rise of foundation models, a new artificial intelligence paradigm has emerged, by simply using general purpose foundation models with prompting to solve problems instead of training a separate machine learning model for each problem. Such models have been shown to have emergent properties of solving problems that they were not initially trained on. The studies for the effectiveness of such models are still quite limited. In this work, we widely study the capabilities of the ChatGPT models, namely GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, on 13 affective computing problems, namely aspect extraction, aspect polarity classification, opinion extraction, sentiment analysis, sentiment intensity ranking, emotions intensity ranking, suicide tendency detection, toxicity detection, well-being assessment, engagement measurement, personality assessment, sarcasm detection, and subjectivity detection. We introduce a framework to evaluate the ChatGPT models on regression-based problems, such as intensity ranking problems, by modelling them as pairwise ranking classification. We compare ChatGPT against more traditional NLP methods, such as end-to-end recurrent neural networks and transformers. The results demonstrate the emergent abilities of the ChatGPT models on a wide range of affective computing problems, where GPT-3.5 and especially GPT-4 have shown strong performance on many problems, particularly the ones related to sentiment, emotions, or toxicity. The ChatGPT models fell short for problems with implicit signals, such as engagement measurement and subjectivity detection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Amin","given":"Mostafa M."},{"family":"Mao","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Cambria","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Schuller","given":"Bj√∂rn W."}],"citation-key":"amin_wide_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2308.13911","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,26]]},"number":"arXiv:2308.13911","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Wide Evaluation of ChatGPT on Affective Computing Tasks","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13911"},
  {"id":"amouzegar_sting_2021","abstract":"The interrogation of intrinsic and adaptive resistance to cancer immunotherapy has identified lack of antigen presentation and type I interferon signaling as biomarkers of non-T-cell-inflamed tumors and clinical progression. A myriad of pre-clinical studies have implicated the cGAS/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, a cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway that drives activation of type I interferons and other inflammatory cytokines, in the host immune response against tumors. The STING pathway is also increasingly understood to have other anti-tumor functions such as modulation of the vasculature and augmentation of adaptive immunity via the support of tertiary lymphoid structure development. Many natural and synthetic STING agonists have entered clinical development with the first generation of intra-tumor delivered cyclic dinucleotides demonstrating safety but only modest systemic activity. The development of more potent and selective STING agonists as well as novel delivery systems that would allow for sustained inflammation in the tumor microenvironment could potentially augment response rates to current immunotherapy approaches and overcome acquired resistance. In this review, we will focus on the latest developments in STING-targeted therapies and provide an update on the clinical development and application of STING agonists administered alone, or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade or other approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Amouzegar","given":"Afsaneh"},{"family":"Chelvanambi","given":"Manoj"},{"family":"Filderman","given":"Jessica N."},{"family":"Storkus","given":"Walter J."},{"family":"Luke","given":"Jason J."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"amouzegar_sting_2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13112695","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"11","page":"2695","PMCID":"PMC8198217","PMID":"34070756","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"6.575","title":"STING Agonists as Cancer Therapeutics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/11/2695","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"an_tacrolimus_2023","abstract":"Introduction: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an important health concern as a severe autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. Traditionally, the first-line treatment for ITP involves glucocorticoids. However, a substantial number of patients develop resistance or relapse within the first year of treatment, presenting a formidable challenge for medical practitioners. The consequences of prolonged glucocorticoid therapy, such as severe adverse effects, further necessitate the exploration of alternative, more effective, and safer treatments. In recent years, tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor, has emerged as a potential candidate for managing ITP. It has shown promising efficacy against anti-platelet antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia, thus expanding the therapeutic options for resistant or relapsed ITP patients. Our previous work ( BJH 2022) also highlighted the potential of tacrolimus in suppressing the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and the apoptosis of MSCs-C+ cells both in vivo and in vitro. This research formed a solid foundation for further investigation into the roles of tacrolimus in ITP. Building on this background, our current research focuses on evaluating the effectiveness and safety of combining tacrolimus and danazol as a second-line therapy for patients with steroid-resistant or relapsed ITP. This study was designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of this therapeutic combination, which could pave the way for optimized treatment regimens for ITP, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.\n            Methods: This phase 2, randomized, open-label trial involved adult ITP patients demonstrating drug resistance or relapse from seven tertiary medical centers across China. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week treatment of either tacrolimus (initial dose 0.03 mg/kg/d, maintaining a blood concentration between 3-5 ng/mL) combined with danazol (200 mg bid) or monotherapy with danazol (200 mg bid). The primary endpoint entailed a 6-month sustained response, denoted by maintaining platelet counts &gt; 50√ó10^9/L without additional ITP-modifying therapies at the 6-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints comprised an initial response, response duration, bleeding scores, and adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials (NCT05471050).\n            Results: The study enrolled 90 steroid-resistant or relapsed ITP patients, with 43 assigned to the tacrolimus plus danazol group and 47 to the danazol monotherapy group. The participants in the combination group had a median age of 48 years (range: 30-53), and in the monotherapy group, it was 40 years (range: 28-51). Both groups had a marginally higher proportion of female participants. The median primary ITP duration was two months for both groups. Baseline bleeding scores and bleeding or platelet transfusion instances at enrollment were similar across groups. The results showed a promising improvement in the patient response. The tacrolimus plus danazol group showed a significantly higher 6-month sustained response rate (53%, n=23) than the danazol group (30%, n=14) (odds ratio: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.16-6.13, p=0.032). While there was no significant difference in the response times across the groups, the combination group attained a significantly higher peak platelet count (90 √ó10^9/L) than the monotherapy group (70 √ó10^9/L) (p=0.031). This suggests that the addition of tacrolimus to the therapy can significantly boost the platelet count, potentially improving the clinical outcomes for the patients. Response durations were comparable in both groups, indicating that the addition of tacrolimus did not negatively impact the duration of response. Last, treatment was well-tolerated with no grade 3 or 4 events or treatment-related deaths reported in both groups.\n            Conclusions: The tacrolimus and danazol combination emerges as a promising second-line treatment for steroid-resistant or relapsed ITP. This regimen demonstrated a higher 6-month sustained response rate and peak platelet count compared to danazol monotherapy, substantiating its potential role as a novel treatment strategy for adult ITP patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"An","given":"Zhuo-Yu"},{"family":"He","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiao-lu"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Qiu-Sha"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Haixia"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuan-Yuan"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Ying-jun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xiangyu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Kaiyan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaohui"}],"citation-key":"an_tacrolimus_2023","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-188139","ISSN":"0006-4971, 1528-0020","issue":"Supplement 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"language":"en","page":"2582-2582","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tacrolimus and Danazol Combination As a Second-Line Therapeutic Strategy for Steroid-Resistant or Relapsed Immune Thrombocytopenia: A Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label Study","title-short":"Tacrolimus and Danazol Combination As a Second-Line Therapeutic Strategy for Steroid-Resistant or Relapsed Immune Thrombocytopenia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/142/Supplement%201/2582/502015/Tacrolimus-and-Danazol-Combination-As-a-Second","volume":"142"},

The efficacy of PD-1 blockade as compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for MSI-H‚ÄìdMMR advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown.\nMETHODS In this phase 3, open-label trial, 307 patients with metastatic MSI-H‚ÄìdMMR colorectal cancer who had not previously received treatment were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil‚Äìbased therapy with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) every 2 weeks. Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab therapy after disease progression. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival.\nRESULTS At the second interim analysis, after a median follow-up (from randomization to data cutoff) of 32.4 months (range, 24.0 to 48.3), pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.80; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0002). The estimated restricted mean survival after 24 months of follow-up was 13.7 months (range, 12.0 to 15.4) as compared with 10.8 months (range, 9.4 to 12.2). As of the data cutoff date, 56 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 69 in the chemotherapy group had died. Data on overall survival were still evolving (66% of required events had occurred) and remain blinded until the final analysis. An overall response (complete or partial response), as evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was observed in 43.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1% in the chemotherapy group. Among patients with an overall response, 83% in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 35% of patients in the chemotherapy group, had ongoing responses at 24 months. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 22% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 66% (including one patient who died) in the chemotherapy group.\nCONCLUSIONS Pembrolizumab led to significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy when received as first-line therapy for MSI-H‚ÄìdMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

  {"id":"angelucci_iron_2020","abstract":"Background Iron chelation therapy (ICT) in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has not been evaluated in randomized studies. Objective To evaluate event-free survival (EFS) and safety of ICT in iron-overloaded patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS. Design Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (TELESTO). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00940602). Setting 60 centers in 16 countries. Participants 225 patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 2247 pmol/L; prior receipt of 15 to 75 packed red blood cell units; and no severe cardiac, liver, or renal abnormalities. Intervention Deferasirox dispersible tablets (10 to 40 mg/kg per day) (n = 149) or matching placebo (n = 76). Measurements The primary end point was EFS, defined as time from date of randomization to first documented nonfatal event (related to cardiac or liver dysfunction and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia) or death, whichever occurred first. Results Median time on treatment was 1.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.5 to 3.1 years) in the deferasirox group and 1.0 year (IQR, 0.6 to 2.0 years) in the placebo group. Median EFS was prolonged by approximately 1 year with deferasirox versus placebo (3.9 years [95% CI, 3.2 to 4.3 years] vs. 3.0 years [CI, 2.2 to 3.7 years], respectively; hazard ratio, 0.64 [CI, 0.42 to 0.96]). Adverse events occurred in 97.3% of deferasirox recipients and 90.8% of placebo recipients. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (‚â•15 events per 100 patient treatment-years) in deferasirox versus placebo recipients, respectively, were 24.7 versus 23.9 for diarrhea, 21.8 versus 18.7 for pyrexia, 16.7 versus 22.7 for upper respiratory tract infection, and 15.9 versus 0.9 for increased serum creatinine concentration. Limitations The protocol was amended from a phase 3 to a phase 2 study, with a reduced target sample size from 630 to 210 participants. There was differential follow-up between treatment groups. Conclusion The findings support ICT in iron-overloaded patients with low- to intermediate-1-risk MDS, with longer EFS compared with placebo and a clinically manageable safety profile. Therefore, ICT may be considered in these patients.

  {"id":"ansell_overall_2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Five-year follow-up in a trial involving patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classic Hodgkin's lymphoma showed long-term progression-free survival benefits with first-line therapy with brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate, plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD), as compared with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). A planned interim analysis indicated a potential benefit with regard to overall survival; data from a median of 6 years of follow-up are now available. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive up to six cycles of A+AVD or ABVD. The primary end point, modified progression-free survival, has been reported previously. The key secondary end point was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 664 patients were assigned to receive A+AVD and 670 to receive ABVD. At a median follow-up of 73.0 months, 39 patients in the A+AVD group and 64 in the ABVD group had died (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.88; P = 0.009). The 6-year overall survival estimates were 93.9% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.5) in the A+AVD group and 89.4% (95% CI, 86.6 to 91.7) in the ABVD group. Progression-free survival was longer with A+AVD than with ABVD (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.86). Fewer patients in the A+AVD group than in the ABVD group received subsequent therapy, including transplantation, and fewer second cancers were reported with A+AVD (in 23 vs. 32 patients). Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was recommended after an increased incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed with A+AVD. More patients had peripheral neuropathy with A+AVD than with ABVD, but most patients in the two groups had resolution or amelioration of the event by the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received A+AVD for the treatment of stage III or IV Hodgkin's lymphoma had a survival advantage over those who received ABVD.

  {"id":"arabi_surveillance_2020","abstract":"Purpose:‚ÄÇ We examined the association between surveillance for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) among medical-surgi‚Äëcal critically ill patients by twice-weekly ultrasonography and 90-day all-cause mortality.\nMethods:‚ÄÇ This was a pre-planned sub-study of the Pneumatic Compression for Preventing Venous Thromboembo‚Äëlism (PREVENT) trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02040103) that compared addition of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) to pharmacologic prophylaxis versus pharmacologic prophylaxis alone. The surveillance group included enrolled patients in the trial, while the non-surveillance group included eligible non-enrolled patients. Using logistic regres‚Äësion and Cox proportional hazards models, we examined the association of surveillance with the primary outcome of 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE).\nResults:‚ÄÇ The surveillance group consisted of 1682 patients and the non-surveillance group included 383 patients. Using Cox proportional hazards model with bootstrapping, surveillance was associated with a decrease in 90-day mortality (adjusted HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57, 0.98). Surveillance was associated with earlier diagnosis of DVT [(median 4 days (IQR 2, 10) vs. 20 days (IQR 16, 22)] and PE [median 4 days (IQR 2.5, 5) vs. 7.5 days (IQR 6.1, 28.9)].

  {"id":"arai_cumulative_2017","abstract":"Background: Advanced gastric cancer (AGC) and systemic chemotherapy are some of the risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the cumulative incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of VTE have not been evaluated in Japanese patients with AGC.\nMethods: This retrospective study included patients who received fluoropyrimidine-based firstline chemotherapy for AGC between September 2009 and July 2015 at our institution. VTE was diagnosed by computed tomography scan and was managed by anticoagulant therapy. The cumulative incidence of VTE was estimated by the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the risk factors and prognostic impact of VTE.\nResults: Of 283 patients, 37 (13.1%) developed VTE before or during chemotherapy. The cumulative incidence of VTE was 8.7% at 6 months and 13.6% at 1 year. The independent risk factors for VTE were body mass index (BMI) of ‚â•25 kg/m2 (HR 3.38, 95% CI 1.72‚Äì6.65, P < 0.01) and presence of peritoneal metastasis (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.00‚Äì4.00, P < 0.05). The median overall survival (OS) was 13.4 months for patients with VTE and 11.7 months for those without VTE (P = 0.58).

  {"id":"arber_2016_2016","abstract":"The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues was last updated in 2008. Since then, there have been numerous advances in the identification of unique biomarkers associated with some myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias, largely derived from gene expression analysis and next-generation sequencing that can significantly improve the diagnostic criteria as well as the prognostic relevance of entities currently included in the WHO classification and that also suggest new entities that should be added. Therefore, there is a clear need for a revision to the current classification. The revisions to the categories of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia will be published in a monograph in 2016 and reflect a consensus of opinion of hematopathologists, hematologists, oncologists, and geneticists. The 2016 edition represents a revision of the prior classification rather than an entirely new classification and attempts to incorporate new clinical, prognostic, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic data that have emerged since the last edition.

  {"id":"arcila_egfr_2013","abstract":"In contrast to other primary epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung adenocarcinomas, insertions in exon 20 of EGFR have been generally associated with resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Their molecular spectrum, clinicopathologic characteristics, and prevalence are not well established. Tumors harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions were identified through an algorithmic screen of 1,500 lung adenocarcinomas. Cases were first tested for common mutations in EGFR (exons 19 and 21) and KRAS (exon 2) and, if negative, further analyzed for EGFR exon 20 insertions. All samples underwent extended genotyping for other driver mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2/HER2, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, and AKT by mass spectrometry; a subset was evaluated for ALK rearrangements. We identified 33 EGFR exon 20 insertion cases [2.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-3.1], all mutually exclusive with mutations in the other genes tested (except PIK3CA). They were more common among never-smokers (P < 0.0001). There was no association with age, sex, race, or stage. Morphologically, tumors were similar to those with common EGFR mutations but with frequent solid histology. Insertions were highly variable in position and size, ranging from 3 to 12 bp, resulting in 13 different insertions, which, by molecular modeling, are predicted to have potentially different effects on erlotinib binding. EGFR exon 20 insertion testing identifies a distinct subset of lung adenocarcinomas, accounting for at least 9% of all EGFR-mutated cases, representing the third most common type of EGFR mutation after exon 19 deletions and L858R. Insertions are structurally heterogeneous with potential implications for response to EGFR inhibitors.","author":[{"family":"Arcila","given":"Maria E."},{"family":"Nafa","given":"Khedoudja"},{"family":"Chaft","given":"Jamie E."},{"family":"Rekhtman","given":"Natasha"},{"family":"Lau","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Reva","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Zakowski","given":"Maureen F."},{"family":"Kris","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Ladanyi","given":"Marc"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"arcila_egfr_2013","container-title":"Molecular cancer therapeutics","container-title-short":"Mol.

  {"id":"arulananda_combination_2017","abstract":"Abstract Introduction Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor has demonstrated efficacy in tumors harboring the EGFR T790M resistance mutation. Inevitably, resistance to third-generation inhibitors results in disease progression, with the EGFR C797S mutation being one of several resistance pathways identified to date. On the basis of preclinical data, we report what is the first known case of a patient harboring the T790M and C797S mutations in trans treated with combination gefitinib and osimertinib. Methods On development of progressive disease after multiple therapies, the patient's plasma was sequenced using the Oncomine Lung cfDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Subsequent monitoring of circulating tumor DNA in plasma was performed by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Results Sequencing showed that the T790M and C797S mutations were in trans. Within 2 weeks of commencement of combination therapy, rapid clinical improvement occurred. Accompanying this, a rapid decline in the C797S mutation subclone in plasma was detected. However, the levels of the EGFR exon 19 deletion driver mutation and the T790M resistance mutation in the circulating tumor DNA continued to rise and the patient died from progressive disease 6 weeks after commencement of combination therapy. There were no adverse events seen with the combination therapy. Conclusion This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of combination EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy tailored to the allelic conformation of T790M and C797S mutation that resulted in brief clinical improvement without toxicity.","author":[{"family":"Arulananda","given":"Surein"},{"family":"Do","given":"Hongdo"},{"family":"Musafer","given":"Ashan"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Dobrovic","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"John","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"arulananda_combination_2017","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

However, it remains unclear whether the Tim-3‚Äìgalectin-9 pathway is associated with the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Thus, we investigated the expression and function of Tim-3 and the clinical impact of its ligand galectin-9 in MDS. Tim-3 expression levels on MDS blasts by CD45/side-scatter or CD34/CD45 gating were increased as MDS progressed to the advanced stage. Tim-3 expression in the MDS blasts was upregulated in the presence of the cell culture supernatant of human stromal cells or the MDS-related cytokine transforming growth factor-Œ≤1. The proliferation of Tim-3 + MDS blasts was inhibited by the blockade of anti-Tim-3 antibody. Furthermore, plasma levels of galectin-9 were elevated as MDS progressed to the advanced stage in 70 MDS/acute leukemia transformed from MDS patients and was a prognostic factor in 40 MDS patients. Our data demonstrated that the Tim-3-galectin-9 pathway is associated with the pathogenesis and disease progression of MDS. These findings provide new insight into potential immunotherapy targeting the galectin-9‚ÄìTim-3 pathway in MDS.","author":[{"family":"Asayama","given":"Toshio"},{"family":"Tamura","given":"Hideto"},{"family":"Ishibashi","given":"Mariko"},{"family":"Kuribayashi-Hamada","given":"Yasuko"},{"family":"Onodera-Kondo","given":"Asaka"},{"family":"Okuyama","given":"Namiko"},{"family":"Yamada","given":"Akiko"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Masumi"},{"family":"Moriya","given":"Keiichi"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Hidemi"},{"family":"Inokuchi","given":"Koiti"}],"citation-key":"asayama_functional_2017","container-title":"Oncotarget","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.21492","issue":"51","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"88904-88917","title":"Functional expression of Tim-3 on blasts and clinical impact of its ligand galectin-9 in myelodysplastic syndromes","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

Subsequently, catecholaminergic treatment had to be initialised because of cardiac failure. Peripheral eosinophil count was normal at admission and at the time of endomyocardial biopsy. The biopsy, however, proved the diagnosis of eosinophilic myocarditis, but the causative agent remained unclear despite intensive diagnostic work-up. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed signs of acute myocardial oedema and a delayed enhancement in the basal inferolateral segments consistent with acute myocarditis. Under treatment with corticosteroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and warfarin, we accomplished a rapid and complete recovery of cardiac function and histology.

Trop2, a cell membrane glycoprotein, is overexpressed in almost all epithelial cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that Trop2 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and downregulation of Trop2 delays TNBC cell and tumor growth supporting the oncogenic role of Trop2 in breast cancer. Through proteomic profiling, we discovered a metabolic signature comprised of TALDO1, GPI, LDHA, SHMT2, and ADK proteins that were downregulated in Trop2-depleted breast cancer tumors. The identified oncogene-mediated metabolic gene signature is significantly upregulated in TNBC patients across multiple RNA-expression clinical datasets. Our study further reveals that the metabolic gene signature reliably predicts poor survival of breast cancer patients with early stages of the disease. Taken together, our study identified a new five-gene metabolic signature as an accurate predictor of breast cancer outcome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Aslan","given":"Merve"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"En-Chi"},{"family":"Garcia-Marques","given":"Fernando J."},{"family":"Bermudez","given":"Abel"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shiqin"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"West","given":"Meredith"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chiyuan Amy"},{"family":"Rice","given":"Meghan A."},{"family":"Brooks","given":"James D."},{"family":"West","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Pitteri","given":"Sharon J."},{"family":"Gy≈ërffy","given":"Bal√°zs"},{"family":"Stoyanova","given":"Tanya"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"aslan_oncogenemediated_2021","container-title":"npj Breast Cancer","DOI":"10.1038/s41523-021-00341-6","ISSN":"2374-4677","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,28]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-13","PMCID":"PMC8553750","PMID":"34711841","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"7.519","title":"Oncogene-mediated metabolic gene signature predicts breast cancer outcome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41523-021-00341-6","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"atallah_comparison_2020","abstract":"Importance In 2010, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) indicated that data regarding efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) in the CMS beneficiary population with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were currently insufficient, but that coverage would be provided for patients enrolled in a clinical study that met its criteria for Coverage with Evidence Development (CED). Objective The Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) submitted a study concept comparing the outcomes of patients aged 55 to 64 years vs aged 65 years or older who met those criteria, effectively providing coverage by CMS for HCT for MDS. Design, Setting, and Participants Data on patients aged 65 years or older were prospectively collected and their outcomes compared with patients aged 55 to 64 years. Patients were enrolled in the study from December 15, 2010, to May 14, 2014. The results reported herein were analyzed as of September 4, 2017, with a median follow-up of 47 months. The study was conducted by the CIBMTR. It comprises a voluntary working group of more than 420 centers worldwide that contribute detailed data on allogeneic and autologous HCT and cellular therapies. Interventions Patients with MDS received HCT according to institutional guidelines and preferences. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was overall survival (OS); secondary outcomes included nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse-free survival, and acute and chronic graft vs host disease. Results During the study period, 688 patients aged 65 years or older underwent HCT for MDS and were compared with 592 patients aged 55 to 64 years. Other than age, there were no differences in patient and disease characteristics between the groups. On univariate analysis, the 3-year NRM rate was 28% vs 25% for the 65 years or older group vs those aged 55 to 64 years, respectively. The 3-year OS was 37% vs 42% for the 65 years or older group vs the 55 to 64 years age group, respectively. On multivariable analysis after adjusting for excess risk of mortality in the older group, age group had no significant association with OS (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.94-1.27;P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.23) or NRM (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93-1.52;P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.16).

Clinical and biologic characteristics, early response assessed by minimal residual disease at the end of induction (EOI) therapy, and allo-HSCT were analyzed for their impact on outcomes.\nResults\nA specific 11q23/KMT2A translocation partner gene was identified in 84.3% of patients, with the most frequent translocations being t(4;11)(q21;q23) (n = 273; 51.5%), t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) (n = 106; 20.0%), t(9;11)(p21_22;q23) (n = 76; 14.3%), t(6;11)(q27;q23) (n = 20; 3.8%), and t(10;11)(p12;q23) (n = 14; 2.6%); 41 patients (7.7%) had less frequently identified translocation partner genes. Patient characteristics and early response varied among subgroups, indicating large biologic heterogeneity and diversity in therapy sensitivity among 11q23/KMT2A-rearranged ALL. The EOI remission rate was 93.2%, and the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for the entire cohort was 69.1% ¬± 1.9%, with a range from 41.7% ¬± 17.3% for patients with t(9;11)-positive T-ALL (n = 9) and 64.8% ¬± 3.0% for patients with t(4;11)-positive B-ALL (n = 266) to 91.2% ¬± 4.9% for patients with t(11;19)-positive T-ALL (n = 34). Low EOI minimal residual disease was associated with favorable EFS, and induction failure was particularly predictive of nonresponse to further therapy and relapse and poor EFS. In addition, EFS was not improved by allo-HSCT compared with chemotherapy only in patients with both t(4;11)-positive B-ALL (n = 64 v 51; P = .10) and 11q23/KMT2A-rearranged T-ALL (n = 16 v 10; P = .69).\nConclusion\nCompared with historical data, prognosis of patients with noninfant 11q23/KMT2A-rearranged ALL has improved, but allo-HSCT failed to affect outcome.

However, the incidence of cancer-associated VTE varies due to patient-related factors (e.g. thrombophilia, comorbidities, performance status, history of venous diseases), tumour-related factors (e.g. cancer site, stage, grade), and treatment-related factors (e.g. surgery, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis treatment, hormonal and supportive treatment). Furthermore, blood count parameters (e.g. platelets and leukocytes) and biomarkers (e.g. soluble P-selectin and D-dimer) are predictive markers for the risk of VTE in cancer patients and have been used to enhance risk stratification. Evidence suggests that cancer itself is associated with a state of hypercoagulability, driven in part by the release of procoagulant factors, such as tissue factor, from malignant tissue as well as by inflammation-driven activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes. In general, low-molecular-weight heparin (LWMH) monotherapy is the standard of care for the management of cancer-associated VTE, as vitamin K antagonists are less effective in cancer patients. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer a potentially promising treatment option for cancer patients with VTE, but recommendations concerning the routine use of DOACs should await head-to-head studies with LMWH.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ay","given":"Cihan"},{"family":"Pabinger","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Alexander T."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"ay_cancerassociated_2017","container-title":"Thrombosis and Haemostasis","container-title-short":"Thromb Haemost","DOI":"10.1160/TH16-08-0615","ISSN":"0340-6245, 2567-689X","issue":"02","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"219-230","source":"6.681","title":"Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism: Burden, mechanisms, and management","title-short":"Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1160/TH16-08-0615","volume":"117"},
  {"id":"ay_prediction_2010","abstract":"Abstract\n            The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased in cancer patients. To improve prediction of VTE in cancer patients, we performed a prospective and observational cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed cancer or progression of disease after remission. A previously developed risk scoring model for prediction of VTE that included clinical (tumor entity and body mass index) and laboratory (hemoglobin level and thrombocyte and leukocyte count) parameters was expanded by incorporating 2 biomarkers, soluble P-selectin, and D-Dimer. Of 819 patients 61 (7.4%) experienced VTE during a median follow-up of 656 days. The cumulative VTE probability in the original risk model after 6 months was 17.7% in patients with the highest risk score (‚â• 3, n = 93), 9.6% in those with score 2 (n = 221), 3.8% in those with score 1 (n = 229), and 1.5% in those with score 0 (n = 276). In the expanded risk model, the cumulative VTE probability after 6 months in patients with the highest score (‚â• 5, n = 30) was 35.0% and 10.3% in those with an intermediate score (score 3, n = 130) as opposed to only 1.0% in patients with score 0 (n = 200); the hazard ratio of patients with the highest compared with those with the lowest score was 25.9 (8.0-84.6).

  {"id":"ayers_comparing_2023","abstract":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a public social media forum (Reddit‚Äôs r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose ‚Äúwhich response was better‚Äù and judged both ‚Äúthe quality of information provided‚Äù (very poor, poor, acceptable, good, or very good) and ‚Äúthe empathy or bedside manner provided‚Äù (not empathetic, slightly empathetic, moderately empathetic, empathetic, and very empathetic). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians.\nRESULTS Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6% (95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t = 25.4; P < .001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality than physician responses (t = 13.3; P < .001). The proportion of responses rated as good or very good quality (’Ü 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or very good quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated significantly more empathetic than physician responses (t = 18.9; P < .001). The proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (’Ü4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%; physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot.\nCONCLUSIONS In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Ayers","given":"John W"},{"family":"Poliak","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Dredze","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Leas","given":"Eric C"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Zechariah"},{"family":"Kelley","given":"Jessica B"},{"family":"Faix","given":"Dennis J"},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Aaron M"},{"family":"Longhurst","given":"Christopher A"},{"family":"Hogarth","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Davey M"}],"citation-key":"ayers_comparing_2023","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.1838","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","PMCID":"PMC10148230","PMID":"37115527","source":"Zotero","title":"Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"ayers_real_2020","abstract":"Abstract Background Outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for and/or fail high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation in the second line are poor. There is no preferred palliative-intent treatment for patients in this setting. Patients and Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed using the nationwide de-identified electronic health record-derived Flatiron Health database. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated for patients with R/R DLBCL who were ineligible for and/or failed autologous stem cell transplantation in the second line and received bendamustine, gemcitabine, or lenalidomide. Results Three hundred eighty-three patients were included. Therapy received was bendamustine in 158 patients, gemcitabine in 142 patients, and lenalidomide in 83 patients. The median EFS and OS for all patients was 4.1 months and 8.7 months, respectively. Compared with patients receiving bendamustine or gemcitabine, those receiving lenalidomide demonstrated significantly longer median EFS (6.8 vs. 3.8 months; PÔøΩ=ÔøΩ.006) and median OS (15.4 vs. 7.7 months; PÔøΩ= .045). Survival outcomes were also improved for lenalidomide-treated patients specifically in the second- as well as third- or fourth-line settings. Conclusion Use of lenalidomide resulted in prolonged EFS and OS as compared with bendamustine or gemcitabine in this cohort of patients with R/R DLBCL receiving palliative therapy. This first large-scale analysis of real-world outcomes for this patient population may guide current clinical management as well as serve as a benchmark for survival outcomes in the standard-of-care setting, which may aid in the design of future clinical trials.","author":[{"family":"Ayers","given":"Emily C."},{"family":"Margolis","given":"David J."},{"family":"Landsburg","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"ayers_real_2020","container-title":"Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma & Leukemia","container-title-short":"Cl.

  {"id":"b_malignancies_","abstract":"Objective To identify individuals with cancer with an increased thrombotic risk, evaluating different tumor sites, the presence of distant metastases, and carrier status of prothrombotic mutations. Design, Setting, and Patients A large population-based, case-control (Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment [MEGA] of risk factors for venous thrombosis) study of 3220 consecutive patients aged 18 to 70 years, with a first deep venous thrombosis of the leg or pulmonary embolism, between March 1, 1999, and May 31, 2002, at 6 anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands, and separate 2131 control participants (partners of the patients) reported via a questionnaire on acquired risk factors for venous thrombosis. Three months after discontinuation of the anticoagulant therapy, all patients and controls were interviewed, a blood sample was taken, and DNA was isolated to ascertain the factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210A mutations. Main Outcome Measure Risk of venous thrombosis.\nResults The overall risk of venous thrombosis was increased 7-fold in patients with a malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2-8.6) vs persons without malignancy. Patients with hematological malignancies had the highest risk of venous thrombosis, adjusted for age and sex (adjusted OR, 28.0; 95% CI, 4.0199.7), followed by lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer. The risk of venous thrombosis was highest in the first few months after the diagnosis of malignancy (adjusted OR, 53.5; 95% CI, 8.6-334.3). Patients with cancer with distant metastases had a higher risk vs patients without distant metastases (adjusted OR, 19.8; 95% CI, 2.6-149.1). Carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation who also had cancer had a 12-fold increased risk vs individuals without cancer and factor V Leiden (adjusted OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 1.6-88.1). Similar results were indirectly calculated for the prothrombin 20210A mutation in patients with cancer.\nConclusions Patients with cancer have a highly increased risk of venous thrombosis especially in the first few months after diagnosis and in the presence of distant metastases. Carriers of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210A mutations appear to have an even higher risk.","author":[{"family":"B","given":"lom Jeanet W"},{"family":"D","given":"oggen Carine J M"},{"family":"O","given":"santo Susanne"},{"family":"R","given":"osendaal Frits R"}],"citation-key":"b_malignancies_","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Malignancies, Prothrombotic Mutations, and the Risk of Venous Thrombosis","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"bacac_cd20tcb_2018","abstract":"Purpose: Despite promising clinical activity, T cell engaging therapies including T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are associated with severe side effects requiring the use of step-up-dosing (SUD) regimens to mitigate safety. Here, we present a next generation CD20-targeting TCB (CD20-TCB) with significantly higher potency and a novel approach enabling safer administration of such potent drug. Experimental design: We developed CD20-TCB based on the 2:1 TCB molecular format and characterized its activity pre-clinically. We also applied a single administration of obinutuzumab (Gazyva pre-treatment, Gpt) prior to the first infusion of CD20-TCB as a way to safely administer such a potent drug. Results: CD20-TCB is associated with a long half-life and high potency enabled by high-avidity bivalent binding to CD20 and head-to-tail orientation of B and T cell binding domains in a 2:1 molecular format. CD20-TCB displays considerably higher potency than other CD20-TCB antibodies in clinical development and is efficacious on tumor cells expressing low levels of CD20. CD20-TCB also displays potent activity in primary tumor samples with low effector:target ratios. In vivo, CD20-TCB regresses established tumors of aggressive lymphoma models. Gpt enables profound B cell depletion in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs and reduces T cell activation and cytokine release in the peripheral blood thus increasing the safety of CD20-TCB administration. Gpt is more efficacious and safer than SUD. Conclusions: CD20-TCB and Gpt represent a potent and safer approach for treatment of lymphoma patients and are currently being evaluated in Phase I, multicenter study in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL (NCT03075696).","author":[{"family":"Bacac","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Colombetti","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Herter","given":"Sylvia"},{"family":"Sam","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Perro","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Stanford"},{"family":"Bianchi","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Marine"},{"family":"Schoenle","given":"Anne"},{"family":"G","given":"Nicolini Valeria"},{"family":"Diggelmann","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Limani","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Schlenker","given":"Ramona"},{"family":"HÁæπsser","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Wolfgang F."},{"family":"Bray-French","given":"Katharine"},{"family":"Hinton","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Giusti","given":"Anna Maria"},{"family":"Freimoser-Grundschober","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Lariviere","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Christiane"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Umana","given":"Pablo"}],"citation-key":"bacac_cd20tcb_2018","container-title":"Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

  {"id":"ballard_preclinical_2016","abstract":"Purpose: Approximately one-third of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-sensitizing mutations (EGFRm) experience disease progression during treatment due to brain metastases. Despite anecdotal reports of EGFR-TKIs providing benefit in some patients with EGFRm NSCLC brain metastases, there is a clinical need for novel EGFR-TKIs with improved efficacy against brain lesions. Experimental design: We performed preclinical assessments of brain penetration and activity of osimertinib (AZD9291), an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR-TKI selective for EGFRm and T790M resistance mutations, and other EGFR-TKIs in various animal models of EGFR-mutant NSCLC brain metastases. We also present case reports of previously treated patients with EGFRm advanced NSCLC and brain metastases who received osimertinib in the phase I/II AURA study (NCT01802632). Results: Osimertinib demonstrated greater penetration of the mouse blood-brain barrier than gefitinib, rociletinib (CO-1686), or afatinib, and at clinically relevant doses induced sustained tumor regression in an EGFRm PC9 mouse brain metastases model; rociletinib did not achieve tumor regression. Under positron emission tomography micro-dosing conditions, [11C]osimertinib showed markedly greater exposure in the cynomolgus monkey brain than [11C]rociletinib and [11C]gefitinib. Early clinical evidence of osimertinib activity in previously treated patients with EGFRm advanced NSCLC and brain metastases is also reported. Conclusions: Osimertinib may represent a clinically significant treatment option for patients with EGFRm NSCLC and brain metastases. Further investigation of osimertinib in this patient population is ongoing.","author":[{"family":"Ballard","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Yates","given":"James W.T."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhenfan"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dong Wan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"James Chih-Hsin"},{"family":"Cantarini","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Pickup","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Hickey","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Grist","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Box","given":"Matthew R."},{"family":"JohnstrÁππm","given":"Peter"},{"family":"VarnÁì£s","given":"Katarina"},{"family":"Malmquist","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Thress","given":"Kenneth S."},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."},{"family":"Cross","given":"Darren"}],"citation-key":"ballard_preclinical_2016","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

  {"id":"ballatore_molecular_2023","abstract":"Background: In the metastatic setting, cancer patients may not benefit from standard care regimes and their diseases undergo drug resistance due to tumour cell heterogeneity and genomic landscape complexity. In recent years, there have been several attempts to personalise the diagnostic-therapeutic path and to propose novel strategies based on not only histological test results but also on each patient‚Äôs clinical history and molecular biology. Profiling molecular tests allows physicians to investigate the single tumour genomic landscape and to promote targeted approaches. The Molecular Tumour Board (MTB) is a multidisciplinary committee dedicated to selecting individualised and targeted therapeutic strategies appropriate for patients suffering from diseases that present resistance to standard care. Materials and Methods: Our MTB settled in ‚ÄúAzienda Ospedaliero Universitaria delle Marche‚Äù, Ancona (AN), Italy, and includes oncologists, molecular biologists, geneticists, and other specialists. Clinical cases are referred by physicians to the MTB, through the Cancer and Research Centre of the Marche Region (CORM), through a telemedicine platform. Four possible molecular profiles are available: FoundationOne¬Æ CDx e FoundationOne¬ÆLiquid CDx and two local Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels, with 16 DNA genes and 10 RNA genes respectively. The resulting genetic mutations and their analyses are evaluated by all the members of the Board and a report for each patient is provided with medical recommendations. Results: from June 2021 to May 2023, we collected data from 97 referral patients (M: 49, F: 48). The mean age was 60.6 years (range 22‚Äì83 years). 90 cases were approved for testing. Only seven patients were not eligible for genomic profiling. In two patients who were eligible, molecular profiling was not performed because a tissue sample was not available. Off-label therapy was recommended for three patients. 5% of cases (5/88) showed addressable driver mutations associated with an existing targeted therapy and were immediately enrolled. Conclusions: MTB presents a powerful tool for offering precise medical goals. Our Department of Clinical Oncology also takes advantage of the important role of multidisciplinary teams, through the establishment of CORM and MTB meetings, within which there is the chance to perform NGS-based analyses. It will be important in the future to implement the use of genomic profiling to improve personalised care and to guide the choice of suitable therapies and more appropriate management of patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ballatore","given":"Zelmira"},{"family":"Bozzi","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Cardea","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Savino","given":"Francesco Domenico"},{"family":"Migliore","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Tarantino","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Chiodi","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Ambrosini","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Bianchi","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Goteri","given":"Gaia"},{"family":"Filosa","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Barbisan","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Bartoli","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Papa","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Berardi","given":"Rossana"}],"citation-key":"ballatore_molecular_2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","container-title-short":"J.

Unfortunately, about a quarter of patients receiving neoadjuvant trastuzumab experience disease recurrence, revealing the unquestionable need for further improvement of treatment outcomes.\nSUMMARY: Adding HER2 blockade to adjuvant trastuzumab with pertuzumab and neratinib improves invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), particularly for those at highest risk of recurrence. A shift toward a neoadjuvant strategy for patients with a higher risk of recurrence could result in further treatment optimization. For patients without a pathological complete response (pCR) after the neoadjuvant part of the therapy, a switch to adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine significantly improves IDFS and distant recurrence-free survival and shows a trend towards improved overall survival (OS). On the other hand, for low-risk patients, chemotherapy deescalation should be strongly considered with the use of trastuzumab monotherapy as an anti-HER2 backbone.\nKEY MESSAGES: Neoadjuvant therapy should be offered for a significant proportion of HER2-positive early breast cancer patients with a higher risk of recurrence. Postneoadjuvant treatment should be tailored according to the initial stage of disease and the response to neoadjuvant treatment.","author":[{"family":"Ban","given":"Marija"},{"family":"Petriƒá Mi≈°e","given":"Branka"},{"family":"Vrdoljak","given":"Eduard"}],"citation-key":"ban_early_2020","container-title":"Breast Care (Basel, Switzerland)","container-title-short":"Breast Care (Basel)","DOI":"10.1159/000511883","ISSN":"1661-3791","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"560-569","PMCID":"PMC7768133","PMID":"33447229","source":"PubMed","title":"Early HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: Current Treatment and Novel Approaches","title-short":"Early HER2-Positive Breast Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"bando_therapeutic_2023","abstract":"In the era of targeted therapy based on genomic alterations, the treatment strategy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been changing. Before systemic treatment initiation, determination of tumour genomic status for KRAS and NRAS, BRAFV600E mutations, ERBB2, and microsatellite instability and/or mismatch repair (MMR) status is recommended. In patients with deficient MMR and BRAFV600E mCRC, randomized phase III trials have established the efficacy of pembrolizumab as first-line therapy and the combination of encorafenib and cetuximab as second-line or third-line therapy. In addition, new agents have been actively developed in other rare molecular fractions such as ERBB2 alterations and KRASG12C mutations. In March 2022, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for ERBB2-positive mCRC was approved in Japan, thereby combining real-world evidence from the SCRUM-Japan Registry. As the populations are highly fragmented owing to rare genomic alterations, various strategies in clinical development are expected. Clinical development of a tumour-agnostic approach, such as NTRK fusion and tumour mutational burden, has successfully introduced corresponding drugs to clinical practice. Considering the difficulty of randomized trials owing to cost‚Äìbenefit and rarity, a promising solution could be real-world evidence utilized as an external control from the molecular-based disease registry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bando","given":"Hideaki"},{"family":"Ohtsu","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Yoshino","given":"Takayuki"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"bando_therapeutic_2023","container-title":"Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol","DOI":"10.1038/s41575-022-00736-1","ISSN":"1759-5053","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 Springer Nature Limited","number":"5","page":"306-322","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"65.1","title":"Therapeutic landscape and future direction of metastatic colorectal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-022-00736-1","volume":"20"},

The median age of patients was 67Áπö0 years (IQR 57Áπö0-73Áπö0); 101 (70%) were male and 44 (30%) were female; most participants were White (119 [82%]) and not Hispanic or Latino (132 [91%]). 42 (29%) patients received previous CAR T therapy and 119 (82%) were refractory to the last line of therapy. Median duration of follow-up was 4Áπö2 months (IQR 1Áπö5-11Áπö5). During dose escalation, odronextamab was administered up to the maximum dose of 320 mg once per week and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The recommended dose for expansion in patients with follicular lymphoma grade 1-3a was 80 mg and was 160 mg for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Cytokine release syndrome and neurological treatment-emergent adverse events were predominantly low grade and did not result in treatment discontinuation.

This prespecified, exploratory biomarker analysis from the ASCENT trial evaluates the association between tumor Trop-2 expression and germline BRCA1/2 mutation status with clinical outcomes.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with mTNBC refractory to or progressing after two or more prior chemotherapies, with one or more in the metastatic setting, were randomized to receive SG (10 mg/kg intravenously days 1 and 8, every 21 days) or TPC (capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Biopsy or surgical specimens were collected at study entry to determine Trop-2 expression level using a validated immunohistochemistry assay and histochemical scoring. Germline BRCA1/2 mutation status was collected at baseline.\nRESULTS: Of 468 assessable patients, 290 had Trop-2 expression data [64% (n¬†= 151 SG) versus 60% (n¬†= 139 TPC)] and 292 had known BRCA1/2 mutation status [63% (n¬†= 149 SG) versus 61% (n¬†= 143 TPC)]. Median progression-free survival in SG- versus TPC-treated patients was 6.9, 5.6, and 2.7 months versus 2.5, 2.2, and 1.6 months for high, medium, and low Trop-2 expression, respectively. Median overall survival (14.2, 14.9, and 9.3 months versus 6.9, 6.9, and 7.6 months) and objective response rates (44%, 38%, and 22% versus 1%, 11%, and 6%) were numerically higher with SG versus TPC in patients with high, medium, and low Trop-2 expression, respectively. Efficacy outcomes were numerically higher with SG versus TPC in patients with and without germline BRCA1/2 mutations.\nCONCLUSIONS: SG benefits patients with previously treated mTNBC expressing high/medium Trop-2 compared with standard-of-care chemotherapy and regardless of germline BRCA1/2 mutation status. The small number of patients with low Trop-2 expression precludes definitive conclusions on the benefit of SG in this subgroup.","author":[{"family":"Bardia","given":"A."},{"family":"Tolaney","given":"S.

For decades, most research on improving treatment outcomes has focussed on modulating radiation-induced biological effects on cancer cells.

  {"id":"barlesi_routine_2016","abstract":"Background: The molecular profiling of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for known oncogenic drivers is recommended during routine care. Nationally, however, the feasibility and effects on outcomes of this policy are unknown. We aimed to assess the characteristics, molecular profiles, and clinical outcomes of patients who were screened during a 1-year period by a nationwide programme funded by the French National Cancer Institute. Methods This study included patients with advanced NSCLC, who were routinely screened for EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, as well as HER2 (ERBB2), KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations by 28 certified regional genetics centres in France. Patients were assessed consecutively during a 1-year period from April, 2012, to April, 2013. We measured the frequency of molecular alterations in the six routinely screened genes, the turnaround time in obtaining molecular results, and patients' clinical outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01700582. Findings 18 679 molecular analyses of 17 664 patients with NSCLC were done (of patients with known data, median age was 64Áπö5 years [range 18ÔøΩÔøΩ98], 65% were men, 81% were smokers or former smokers, and 76% had adenocarcinoma). The median interval between the initiation of analysis and provision of the written report was 11 days (IQR 7ÔøΩÔøΩ16). A genetic alteration was recorded in about 50% of the analyses; EGFR mutations were reported in 1947 (11%) of 17 706 analyses for which data were available, HER2 mutations in 98 (1%) of 11 723, KRAS mutations in 4894 (29%) of 17 001, BRAF mutations in 262 (2%) of 13 906, and PIK3CA mutations in 252 (2%) of 10 678; ALK rearrangements were reported in 388 (5%) of 8134 analyses. The median duration of follow-up at the time of analysis was 24Áπö9 months (95% CI 24Áπö8ÔøΩÔøΩ25Áπö0). The presence of a genetic alteration affected first-line treatment for 4176 (51%) of 8147 patients and was associated with a significant improvement in the proportion of patients achieving an overall response in first-line treatment (37% [95% CI 34Áπö7ÔøΩÔøΩ38Áπö2] for presence of a genetic alteration vs 33% [29Áπö5ÔøΩÔøΩ35Áπö6] for absence of a genetic alteration; p=0Áπö03) and in second-line treatment (17% [15Áπö0ÔøΩÔøΩ18Áπö8] vs 9% [6Áπö7ÔøΩÔøΩ11Áπö9]; p<0Áπö0001). Presence of a genetic alteration was also associated with improved first-line progression-free survival (10Áπö0 months [95% CI 9Áπö2ÔøΩÔøΩ10Áπö7] vs 7Áπö1 months [6Áπö1ÔøΩÔøΩ7Áπö9]; p<0Áπö0001) and overall survival (16Áπö5 months [15Áπö0ÔøΩÔøΩ18Áπö3] vs 11Áπö8 months [10Áπö1ÔøΩÔøΩ13Áπö5]; p<0Áπö0001) compared with absence of a genetic alteration. Interpretation Routine nationwide molecular profiling of patients with advanced NSCLC is feasible. The frequency of genetic alterations, acceptable turnaround times in obtaining analysis results, and the clinical advantage provided by detection of a genetic alteration suggest that this policy provides a clinical benefit.","author":[{"family":"Barlesi","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Mazieres","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Merlio","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Debieuvre","given":"Didier"},{"family":"Mosser","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Lena","given":"HervÁüá"},{"family":"Ouafik","given":"L'Houcine"},{"family":"Besse","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Rouquette","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Westeel","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Escande","given":"Fabienne"},{"family":"Monnet","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Lemoine","given":"Antoinette"},{"family":"Veillon","given":"Remi"},{"family":"Blons","given":"HÁüálÁô°ne"},{"family":"Audigier-Valette","given":"Clarisse"},{"family":"Bringuier","given":"Pierre-Paul"},{"family":"Lamy","given":"R."},{"family":"Beau-Faller","given":"MichÁô°le"},{"family":"Pujol","given":"Jean-Louis"},{"family":"Sabourin","given":"Jean-Christophe"},{"family":"Penault-Llorca","given":"FrÁüádÁüárique"},{"family":"Denis","given":"Marc G."},{"family":"Lantuejoul","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Morin","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Tran","given":"QuÁíΩn"},{"family":"Missy","given":"P."},{"family":"Langlais","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Milleron","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Cadranel","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Soria","given":"Jean-Charles"},{"family":"Zalcman","given":"GÁüárard"}],"citation-key":"barlesi_routine_2016","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"Lancet Lond.

  {"id":"bayi_current_2020","abstract":"Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) is a potentially fatal and common complication in myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The timing and grade of CIN may play prognostic and predictive roles in cancer therapy. CIN is associated with older age, poor functional and nutritional status, the presence of significant comorbidities, the type of cancer, previous chemotherapy cycles, the stage of the disease, specific chemotherapy regimens, and combined therapies. There are many key points and new challenges in the management of CIN in adults including: (1) Genetic risk factors to evaluate the patient's risk for CIN remain unclear. However, these risk factors urgently need to be identified. (2) Febrile neutropenia (FN) remains one of the most common reasons for oncological emergency. No consensus nomogram for FN risk assessment has been established. (3) Different assessment tools [e.g., Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC), the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia (CISNE) score model, and other tools] have been suggested to help stratify the risk of complications in patients with FN. However, current tools have limitations. The CISNE score model is useful to support decision-making, especially for patients with stable FN. (4) There are still some challenges, including the benefits of granulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment and the optimal antibiotic regimen in emergency management of FN. In view of the current reports, our group discusses the key points, new challenges, and management of CIN.","author":[{"family":"Ba Yi","given":""},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yuankai"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Wenqi"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Jifeng"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qingyuan"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Wensheng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Binghe"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Rui-Hua"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Zhiguo"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Xiaodong"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Mengzhao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Y."},{"family":"Shuang","given":"Yuerong"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Zuoxing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Herui"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Conghua"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Huiqiang"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Wangjun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Gongyan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaotian"},{"family":"An","given":"Hanxiang"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Yanhong"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Jianping"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"An","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yanxia"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jialei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaohua"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhi Qiang"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Puyuan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Chenfei"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"bayi_current_2020","container-title":"Cancer biology & medicine","container-title-short":"Cancer Biol.

  {"id":"beam_big_2018","abstract":"Nearly all aspects of modern life are in some way being changed by big data and machine learning. Netflix knows what movies people like to watch and Google knows what people want to know based on their search histories. Indeed, Google has recently begun to replace much of its existing non‚Äìmachine learning technology with machine learning algorithms, and there is great optimism that these techniques can provide similar improvements across many sectors.It is no surprise then that medicine is awash with claims of revolution from the application of machine learning to big health care data. Recent examples have demonstrated that big data and machine learning can create algorithms that perform on par with human physicians. Though machine learning and big data may seem mysterious at first, they are in fact deeply related to traditional statistical models that are recognizable to most clinicians. It is our hope that elucidating these connections will demystify these techniques and provide a set of reasonable expectations for the role of machine learning and big data in health care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Beam","given":"Andrew L."},{"family":"Kohane","given":"Isaac S."}],"citation-key":"beam_big_2018","container-title":"JAMA","container-title-short":"JAMA","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2017.18391","ISSN":"0098-7484","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"1317-1318","PMID":"29532063","source":"Silverchair","title":"Big Data and Machine Learning in Health Care","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.18391","volume":"319"},

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"},{"family":"McMillan-Major","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Shmitchell","given":"Shmargaret"}],"citation-key":"bender_dangers_2021","collection-title":"FAccT '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","container-title-short":"Proc. 2021 ACM Conf.

  {"id":"bennouna_continuation_2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab plus fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is standard treatment for first-line and bevacizumab-naive second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. We assessed continued use of bevacizumab plus standard second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer progressing after standard first-line bevacizumab-based treatment.\nMETHODS: In an open-label, phase 3 study in 220 centres in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, patients (aged ‚â•18 years) with unresectable, histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer progressing up to 3 months after discontinuing first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to second-line chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab 2¬∑5 mg/kg per week equivalent (either 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 7¬∑5 mg/kg every 3 weeks, intravenously). The choice between oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based second-line chemotherapy depended on the first-line regimen (switch of chemotherapy). A combination of a permuted block design and the Pocock and Simon minimisation algorithm was used for the randomisation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00700102.\nFINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2006, and June 9, 2010, 409 (50%) patients were assigned to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 411 (50%) to chemotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 11¬∑1 months (IQR 6¬∑4-15¬∑6) in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group and 9¬∑6 months (5¬∑4-13¬∑9) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 11¬∑2 months (95% CI 10¬∑4-12¬∑2) for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and 9¬∑8 months (8¬∑9-10¬∑7) for chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0¬∑81, 95% CI 0¬∑69-0¬∑94; unstratified log-rank test p=0¬∑0062). Grade 3-5 bleeding or haemorrhage (eight [2%] vs one [<1%]), gastrointestinal perforation (seven [2%] vs three [<1%]), and venous thromboembolisms (19 [5%] vs 12 [3%]) were more common in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group. The most frequently reported grade 3-5 adverse events were neutropenia (65 [16%] in the bevacizumab and chemotherapy group vs 52 [13%] in the chemotherapy alone group), diarrhoea (40 [10%] vs 34 [8%], respectively), and asthenia (23 [6%] vs 17 [4%], respectively). Treatment-related deaths were reported for four patients in the bevacizumab plus chemotherapy group and three in the chemotherapy alone group.\nINTERPRETATION: Maintenance of VEGF inhibition with bevacizumab plus standard second-line chemotherapy beyond disease progression has clinical benefits in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Rituximab monotherapy and fludarabine-rituximab in combination are documented treatment options. In a prospective, nonrandomized multicenter trial, 45 eligible patients received rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 1 and bendamustine 90 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 for 4 cycles at a 28-day interval. Thirty-two patients (71%) responded; 18 (40%) achieved complete response (CR) and 14 (31%) partial response (PR). Among 14 patients previously treated with rituximab or fludarabine-rituximab, 7 (50%) responded to bendamustine-rituximab (3 CR and 4 PR). Hemoglobin levels increased by a median of 4.4 g/dL in the complete responders, 3.9 g/dL in those achieving PR, and 3.7 g/dL in the whole cohort. The 10th percentile of response duration was not reached after 32 months. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 15 patients (33%), but only 5 (11%) experienced infection with or without neutropenia.

  {"id":"berentsen_how_2021","abstract":"The last decades have seen great progress in the treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Comparative trials are lacking, and recommendations must be based mainly on nonrandomized trials and will be influenced by personal experience. Herein, current treatment options are reviewed and linked to 3 cases, each addressing specific aspects of therapy. Two major steps in CAD pathogenesis are identified, clonal B-cell lymphoproliferation and complement-mediated hemolysis, each of which constitutes a target of therapy. Although drug treatment is not always indicated, patients with symptomatic anemia or other bothersome symptoms should be treated. The importance of avoiding ineffective therapies is underscored. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat CAD. Studies on safety and efficacy of relevant drugs and combinations are briefly described. The author recommends that B cell‚Äìdirected approaches remain the first choice in most patients requiring treatment. The 4-cycle bendamustine plus rituximab combination is highly efficacious and sufficiently safe and induces durable responses in most patients, but the time to response can be many months. Rituximab monotherapy should be preferred in frail patients. The complement C1s inhibitor sutimlimab is an emerging option in the second line and may also find its place in the first line in specific situations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Berentsen","given":"Sigbj√∏rn"}],"citation-key":"berentsen_how_2021","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2019003809","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"language":"en","page":"1295-1303","source":"Silverchair","title":"How I treat cold agglutinin disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019003809","volume":"137"},

  {"id":"berglof_targets_2015","abstract":"Ibrutinib (Imbruvica‚Ñ¢) is an irreversible, potent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Over the last few years, ibrutinib has developed from a promising drug candidate to being approved by FDA for the treatment of three B cell malignancies, a truly remarkable feat. Few, if any medicines are monospecific and ibrutinib is no exception; already during ibrutinib's initial characterization, it was found that it could bind also to other kinases. In this review, we discuss the implications of such interactions, which go beyond the selective effect on BTK in B cell malignancies. In certain cases, the outcome of ibrutinib treatment likely results from the combined inhibition of BTK and other kinases, causing additive or synergistic, effects. Conversely, there are also examples when the clinical outcome seems unrelated to inhibition of BTK. Thus, more specifically, adverse effects such as enhanced bleeding or arrhythmias could potentially be explained by different interactions. We also predict that during long-term treatment bone homoeostasis might be affected due to the inhibition of osteoclasts. Moreover, the binding of ibrutinib to molecular targets other than BTK or effects on cells other than B cell-derived malignancies could be beneficial and result in new indications for clinical applications.","author":[{"family":"Bergl√∂f","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Hamasy","given":"A."},{"family":"Meinke","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Palma","given":"Marzia"},{"family":"Krstic","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"M√•nsson","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Kimby","given":"Eva"},{"family":"√ñsterborg","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Smith","given":"C.

  {"id":"bhandary_extracorporeal_2017","abstract":"Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a very effective bridging therapy in patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with cardiogenic shock. A moribund patient in extremis, is not amenable to optimization by standard ACC/AHA guidelines. New approaches and novel salvage techniques are necessary to improve outcomes in patients with refractory clinical settings such as malignant ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock and/or pulmonary failure until further management options are explored. Data base searches were done using key words such as ECLS, VT, cardiac arrest, VT ablation, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). The use of ECLS has been described in a few case reports to facilitate VT ablation for incessant VT refractory to medical therapy. For patients with, out-of- hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) and VT, Minnesota Resuscitation Consortium has implemented emergent advanced perfusion and reperfusion strategy, followed by coronary angiography and primary coronary intervention to improve outcome. The major indications for ECLS are cardiogenic shock related to acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, post embolic acute cor pulmonale, drug intoxication and post cardiac arrest syndrome with the threat of multiorgan failure. ECLS permits the use of negative inotropic antiarrhythmic drug therapy, facilitates the weaning of catecholamine administration, thereby ending the vicious cycle of catecholamine driven electric storm. ECLS provides hemodynamic support during ablation procedure, while mapping and induction of VT is undertaken. ECLS provides early access to cardiac catheterization laboratory in patients with cardiac arrest due to shockable rhythm. The current evidence from literature, supports the use of ECLS to ensure adequate vital organ perfusion in patients with refractory VT. ECLS is a safe, feasible and effective therapeutic option when conventional therapies are insufficient to support cardiopulmonary function. A highly driven multidisciplinary team approach is essential to accomplish this task.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhandary","given":"Sujatha P."},{"family":"Joseph","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Hofmann","given":"James P."},{"family":"Saranteas","given":"Theodosios"},{"family":"Papadimos","given":"Thomas J."}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"bhandary_extracorporeal_2017","container-title":"Annals of Translational Medicine","container-title-short":"Ann.

We identify TREM2+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as being correlated with exhausted CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in mouse syngeneic tumor models and human solid tumors of multiple histological types. Fc domain-enhanced anti-TREM2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy promotes anti-tumor immunity by elimination and modulation of TAM populations, which leads to enhanced CD8+ TIL infiltration and effector function. TREM2+ TAMs are most enriched in individuals with ovarian cancer, where TREM2 expression corresponds to disease grade accompanied by worse recurrence-free survival. In an aggressive orthotopic ovarian cancer model, anti-TREM2 mAb therapy drives potent anti-tumor immunity. These results highlight TREM2 as a highly attractive target for immunotherapy modulation in individuals who are refractory to CPI therapy and likely have a TAM-rich tumor microenvironment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Binnewies","given":"Mikhail"},{"family":"Pollack","given":"Joshua L."},{"family":"Rudolph","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Dash","given":"Subhadra"},{"family":"Abushawish","given":"Marwan"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Tian"},{"family":"Jahchan","given":"Nadine S."},{"family":"Canaday","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Erick"},{"family":"Norng","given":"Manith"},{"family":"Mankikar","given":"Shilpa"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Victoria M."},{"family":"Du","given":"Xiaoyan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Ranna"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Rachael"},{"family":"Juric","given":"Vladislava"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Kevin P."},{"family":"Reyno","given":"Leonard"},{"family":"Krummel","given":"Matthew F."},{"family":"Streuli","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Sriram","given":"Venkataraman"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"binnewies_targeting_2021","container-title":"Cell Reports","container-title-short":"Cell Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109844","ISSN":"2211-1247","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"language":"en","page":"109844","PMID":"34686340","source":"9.995","title":"Targeting TREM2 on tumor-associated macrophages enhances immunotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124721013085","volume":"37"},

Activation of NF-Â∫•B through overexpression of c-FLIP or IKK (also known as CFLAR and IKBKB, respectively), or silencing of IÂ∫•B (also known as NFKBIA), rescued EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells from EGFR TKI treatment. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-Â∫•B enhanced erlotinib-induced apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer models. Increased expression of the NF-Â∫•B inhibitor IÂ∫•B predicted for improved response and survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients treated with EGFR TKI.

  {"id":"bjori_hospitalization_2019","abstract":"Background: Previous studies have reported that around 50% of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) has undergone recent hospitalization. However, studies on the impact of hospitalization as a trigger factor for VTE are limited.\nObjectives: To investigate the impact of hospitalization with and without concurrent immobilization as a trigger factor for VTE.\nMethods: We conducted a case-crossover study of 530 cancer-free VTE patients. Hospitalizations were registered during the 90-day period preceding the VTE diagnosis (hazard period), and in four preceding 90-day control periods. A 90-day washout period between the control- and hazard periods was implemented to avoid potential carry-over eÔ¨Äects. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) of VTE according to hospitalization.\nResults: In total, 159 (30%) of the VTE-patients had been hospitalized in the hazard period, and the OR of hospitalization was 9.4 (95% CI: 6.8‚Äì12.8). The risk increased slightly with the total number of days spent in hospital (OR per day: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04‚Äì1.18), and with the number of hospitalizations (OR 8.9, 95% CI: 6.4‚Äì12.4 for 1 hospitalization and OR 12.3, 95% CI 6.4‚Äì23.6 for ‚â•2 hospitalizations).

However, treatment paradigms for HL are rapidly changing with positron emission tomography-adapted therapy, as well as the incorporation of brentuximab vedotin and checkpoint inhibitors into frontline, salvage, and maintenance therapy for HL. Patients who relapse or are refractory to these novel agents are likely to have different responses and outcomes with AHCT than the 3-year event-free survivals of 50% historically reported with AHCT for patients failing conventional combination chemotherapy. This article reviews the current data on the efficacy of AHCT, pretransplant prognostic markers, pretransplant salvage regimens, peritransplant radiation therapy, and posttransplant maintenance therapy in classic HL. Future research should reexamine the efficacy, timing, risk factors, pretransplant salvage regimens, and maintenance approaches posttransplant in the era of brentuximab vedotin and checkpoint inhibitors for HL.","author":[{"family":"Blum","given":"Kristie A."},{"family":"Kristie A.

  {"id":"bobillo_prevention_2022","abstract":"Secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (SCNSL) is defined by the involvement of the CNS, either at the time of initial diagnosis of systemic lymphoma or in the setting of relapse, and can be either isolated or with synchronous systemic disease. The risk of CNS involvement in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is approximately 5%; however, certain clinical and biological features have been associated with a risk of up to 15%. There has been growing interest in improving the definition of patients at increased risk of CNS relapse, as well as identifying effective prophylactic strategies to prevent it. SCNSL often occurs within months of the initial diagnosis of lymphoma, suggesting the presence of occult disease at diagnosis in many cases. The differing presentations of SCNSL create the therapeutic challenge of controlling both the systemic disease and the CNS disease, which uniquely requires agents that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Outcomes are generally poor with a median overall survival of approximately 6 months in retrospective series, particularly in those patients presenting with SCNSL after prior therapy. Prospective studies of intensive chemotherapy regimens containing high-dose methotrexate, followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have shown the most favorable outcomes, especially for patients receiving thiotepa-based conditioning regimens. However, a proportion of patients will not respond to induction therapies or will subsequently relapse, indicating the need for more effective treatment strategies. In this review we focus on the identification of high-risk patients, prophylactic strategies and recent treatment approaches for SCNSL. The incorporation of novel agents in immunochemotherapy deserves further study in prospective trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bobillo","given":"Sabela"},{"family":"Khwaja","given":"Jahanzaib"},{"family":"Ferreri","given":"Andr√©s J.M."},{"family":"Cwynarski","given":"Kate"}],"citation-key":"bobillo_prevention_2022","container-title":"Haematologica","container-title-short":"Haematologica","DOI":"10.3324/haematol.2022.281457","ISSN":"0390-6078","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,17]]},"language":"en","page":"673-689","PMCID":"PMC9973486","PMID":"36384246","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Prevention and management of secondary central nervous system lymphoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9973486/","volume":"108"},

  {"id":"bolanos-meade_three_2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) without malignant relapse is the overall goal of allogeneic haemopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We aimed to evaluate regimens using either maraviroc, bortezomib, or post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for GvHD prophylaxis compared with controls receiving the combination of tacrolimus and methotrexate using a novel composite primary endpoint to identify the most promising intervention to be further tested in a phase 3 trial.\nMETHODS: In this prospective multicentre phase 2 trial, adult patients aged 18-75 years who received reduced-intensity conditioning HCT were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by random block sizes to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on days 3 and 4, followed by tacrolimus starting on day 5 and mycophenolate mofetil starting on day 5 at 15 mg/kg three times daily not to exceed 1 g from day 5 to day 35); tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib (bortezomib 1¬∑3 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 4, and 7 after HCT); or tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc (maraviroc 300 mg orally twice daily from day -3 to day 30 after HCT). Methotrexate was administered as a 15 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on days 3, 6, and 11 after HCT; tacrolimus was given intravenously at a dose of 0¬∑05 mg/kg twice daily (or oral equivalent) starting on day -3 (except the post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, as indicated), with a target level of 5-15 ng/mL. Tacrolimus was continued at least until day 90 and was tapered off by day 180. Each study group was compared separately to a contemporary non-randomised prospective cohort of patients (control group) who fulfilled the same eligibility criteria as the trial, but who were treated with tacrolimus and methotrexate at centres not participating in the trial. The primary endpoint (GvHD-free, relapse-free survival [GRFS]) was defined as the time from HCT to onset of grade 3-4 acute GvHD, chronic GvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression, disease relapse, or death. The study was analysed by modified intention to treat. The study is closed to accrual and this is the planned analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02208037.\nFINDINGS: Between Nov 17, 2014, and May 18, 2016, 273 patients from 31 US centres were randomly assigned to the three study arms: 89 to tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; 92 to tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc; 92 to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; and six were excluded. Between Aug 1, 2014, and Sept 14, 2016, 224 controls received tacrolimus and methotrexate. Controls were generally well matched except for more frequent comorbidities than the intervention groups and a different distribution of types of conditioning regimens used. Compared with controls, the hazard ratio for GRFS was 0¬∑72 (90% CI 0¬∑54-0¬∑94; p=0¬∑044) for tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, 0¬∑98 (0¬∑76-1¬∑27; p=0¬∑92) for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib, and 1¬∑10 (0¬∑86-1¬∑41; p=0¬∑49) for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc. 238 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities: 12 (13%) had grade 3 and 67 (73%) grade 4 events with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; ten (11%) had grade 3 and 68 (76%) had grade 4 events with tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; and 18 (20%) had grade 3 and 63 (68%) had grade 4 events with tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc. The most common toxicities were haematological (77 [84%] for tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; 73 [82%] for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; and 78 [85%] for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc) and cardiac (43 [47%], 44 [49%], and 43 [47%], respectively).\nINTERPRETATION: Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide was the most promising intervention, yielding the best GRFS; this regimen is thus being prospectively compared with tacrolimus and methotrexate in a phase 3 randomised trial.\nFUNDING: US National Health, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Cancer Institute; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; and Millennium Pharmaceuticals.","author":[{"family":"Bola√±os-Meade","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Reshef","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Fei","given":"Mingwei"},{"family":"Abhyankar","given":"Sunil"},{"family":"Al-Kadhimi","given":"Zaid"},{"family":"Alousi","given":"Amin M."},{"family":"Antin","given":"Joseph H."},{"family":"Arai","given":"Sally"},{"family":"Bickett","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yi-Bin"},{"family":"Damon","given":"Lloyd E."},{"family":"Efebera","given":"Yvonne A."},{"family":"Geller","given":"Nancy L."},{"family":"Giralt","given":"Sergio A."},{"family":"Hari","given":"Parameswaran"},{"family":"Holtan","given":"Shernan G."},{"family":"Horowitz","given":"Mary M."},{"family":"Jacobsohn","given":"David A."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Liesveld","given":"Jane L."},{"family":"Logan","given":"Brent R."},{"family":"MacMillan","given":"Margaret L."},{"family":"Mielcarek","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Noel","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Pidala","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Porter","given":"David L."},{"family":"Pusic","given":"Iskra"},{"family":"Sobecks","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Scott R."},{"family":"Weisdorf","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Pasquini","given":"Marcelo C."},{"family":"Koreth","given":"John"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"bolanos-meade_three_2019","container-title":"The Lancet.

  {"id":"bonaca_myocarditis_2019","abstract":"Recent developments in cancer therapeutics have improved outcomes but have also been associated with cardiovascular complications. Therapies harnessing the immune system have been associated with an immune-mediated myocardial injury described as myocarditis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are one such therapy with an increasing number of case and cohort reports describing a clinical syndrome of immune checkpoint inhibitor‚Äìassociated myocarditis. Although the full spectrum of immune checkpoint inhibitor‚Äìassociated cardiovascular disease still needs to be fully defined, described cases of myocarditis range from syndromes with mild signs and symptoms to fatal events. These observations in the clinical setting stand in contrast to outcomes from randomized clinical trials in which myocarditis is a rare event that is investigator reported and lacking in a specific case definition. The complexities associated with diagnosis, as well as the heterogeneous clinical presentation of immune checkpoint inhibitor‚Äìassociated myocarditis, have made ascertainment and identification of myocarditis with high specificity challenging in clinical trials and other data sets, limiting the ability to better understand the incidence, outcomes, and predictors of these rare events. Therefore, establishing a uniform definition of myocarditis for application in clinical trials of cancer immunotherapies will enable greater understanding of these events. We propose an operational definition of cancer therapy-associated myocarditis that may facilitate case ascertainment and report and therefore may enhance the understanding of the incidence, outcomes, and risk factors of this novel clinical syndrome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonaca","given":"Marc P."},{"family":"Olenchock","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Salem","given":"Joe-Elie"},{"family":"Wiviott","given":"Stephen D."},{"family":"Ederhy","given":"Stephane"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Ariel"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Garrick C."},{"family":"Choueiri","given":"Toni K."},{"family":"Di Carli","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Allenbach","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Kumbhani","given":"Dharam J."},{"family":"Heinzerling","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Amiri-Kordestani","given":"Laleh"},{"family":"Lyon","given":"Alexander R."},{"family":"Thavendiranathan","given":"Paaladinesh"},{"family":"Padera","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Lichtman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Peter P."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Douglas B."},{"family":"Moslehi","given":"Javid"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"bonaca_myocarditis_2019","container-title":"Circulation","container-title-short":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034497","ISSN":"0009-7322, 1524-4539","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,2]]},"language":"en","page":"80-91","source":"39.918","title":"Myocarditis in the Setting of Cancer Therapeutics: Proposed Case Definitions for Emerging Clinical Syndromes in Cardio-Oncology","title-short":"Myocarditis in the Setting of Cancer Therapeutics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034497","volume":"140"},
  {"id":"boone_chloroquine_2018","abstract":"Background: The hypercoagulable state associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) results in increased risk of venous thromboembolism, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), whereby activated neutrophils release their intracellular contents containing DNA, histones, tissue factor, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and other components have been implicated in PDA and in cancer-associated thrombosis.\nMethods: Utilizing an orthotopic murine PDA model in C57/Bl6 mice and patient correlative samples, we studied the role of NETs in PDA hypercoagulability and targeted this pathway through treatment with the NET inhibitor chloroquine. PAD4 and RAGE knockout mice, deficient in NET formation, were used to study the role of NETs in platelet aggregation, release of tissue factor and hypercoagulability. Platelet aggregation was assessed using collagen-activated impedance aggregometry. Levels of circulating tissue factor, the initiator of extrinsic coagulation, were measured using ELISA. Thromboelastograms (TEGs) were performed to assess hypercoagulability and changes associated with treatment. Correlative data and samples from a randomized clinical trial of preoperative gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel with and without hydroxychloroquine were studied and the impact of treatment on venous thromboembolism (VTE) rate was evaluated.\nResults: The addition of NETs to whole blood stimulated platelet activation and aggregation. DNA and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were necessary for induction of NET associated platelet aggregation. PAD4 knockout tumor-burdened mice, unable to form NETs, had decreased aggregation and decreased circulating tissue factor. The NET inhibitor chloroquine reduces platelet aggregation, reduces circulating tissue factor and decreases hypercoagulability on TEG. Review of correlative data from patients treated on a randomized protocol of preoperative chemotherapy with and without hydroxychloroquine demonstrated a reduction in peri-operative VTE rate from 30 to 9.1% with hydroxychloroquine that neared statistical significance (p = 0.053) despite the trial not being designed to study VTE.\nConclusion: NETs promote hypercoagulability in murine PDA through stimulation of platelets and release of tissue factor. Chloroquine inhibits NETs and diminishes hypercoagulability. These findings support clinical study of chloroquine to lower rates of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.

  {"id":"brice_comparison_1997","abstract":"PURPOSE\n\nTo evaluate prospectively in patients with follicular lymphoma and a low tumor burden three therapeutic options: delay of any treatment until clinically meaningful progression, immediate treatment with an oral alkylating agent, or treatment with a biologic response modifier, interferon alfa-2b.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\n\nNewly diagnosed follicular lymphoma patients with a low tumor burden (n = 193) were randomly assigned to one of three arms: arm 1, no initial treatment (n = 66); arm 2, prednimustine 200 mg/m2/d for 5 days per month for 18 months (n = 64); or arm 3, interferon alfa 5 MU/d for 3 months then 5 MU three times per week for 15 months (n = 63). Clinical characteristics were similar in the three arms.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOverall response rates with prednimustine and interferon alfa were 78% and 70%, respectively. The overall response to therapy, when deferred, was similar at 70%. With a median follow-up duration of 45 months after randomization, the median freedom-from-treatment (FFT) interval was 24 months in arm 1 and the interval of freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) was 40 months in arm 2 and 35 months in arm 3. The median overall survival time was not reached and the overall survival rate at 5 years was 78% in arm 1, 70% in arm 2, and 84% in arm 3. Therefore, deferred treatment does not adversely influence survival at 5 years. Patients who progressed within 1 year had a significantly shorter survival duration (median, 48 months).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDelayed treatment is feasible in patients with follicular lymphoma and a low tumor burden. For patients with early progression, more intensive therapy should be considered. For others, because delay of treatment until significant clinical progression does not seem to hamper the prognosis or subsequent response to treatment, the long-term toxicity of alkylating agents can be reduced.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Brice","given":"P"},{"family":"Bastion","given":"Y"},{"family":"Lepage","given":"E"},{"family":"Brousse","given":"N"},{"family":"Ha√Øoun","given":"C"},{"family":"Moreau","given":"P"},{"family":"Straetmans","given":"N"},{"family":"Tilly","given":"H"},{"family":"Tabah","given":"I"},{"family":"Solal-C√©ligny","given":"P"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"brice_comparison_1997","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J.

Autoantibodies in patients with WAHA (panagglutinins) typically lack specificity, in contrast to alloantibodies that are typically specific for red-cell antigens. Several retrospective studies have shown that the absolute risk of venous thromboembolic events (pulmonary emboli and deep venous thrombosis) is 15 to 30% among adult patients with WAHA. Prompt transfusion of ABO- and RhD-matched blood is warranted for patients with WAHA and severe anemia (hemoglobin level <6 g per deciliter).

  {"id":"bromberg_survival_2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Studies on the efficacy of rituximab in primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) reported conflicting results. Our international randomized phase 3 study showed that the addition of rituximab to high-dose methotrexate, BCNU, teniposide, and prednisolone (MBVP) in PCNSL was not efficacious in the short term. Here we present long-term results after a median follow-up of 82.3 months.\nMETHODS: One hundred and ninety-nine eligible newly diagnosed, nonimmunocompromised patients with PCNSL aged 18-70 years with WHO performance status 0-3 was randomized between treatment with MBVP chemotherapy with or without rituximab, followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation in responding patients, and reduced-dose WBRT in patients aged‚ÄÖ‚â§‚ÄÖ60 years. Event-free survival was the primary endpoint. Overall survival rate, neurocognitive functioning (NCF), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were additionally assessed, with the IPCG test battery, EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20 questionnaires, respectively.\nRESULTS: For event-free survival, the hazard ratio was 0.85, 95% CI 0.61-1.18, P‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ.33. Overall survival rate at 5 years for MBVP and R-MBVP was 49% (39-59) and 53% (43-63) respectively. In total, 64 patients died in the MBVP arm and 55 in the R-MBVP arm, of which 69% were due to PCNSL. At the group level, all domains of NCF and HRQoL improved to a clinically relevant extent after treatment initiation, and remained stable thereafter up to 60 months of follow-up, except for motor speed which deteriorated between 24 and 60 months. Although fatigue improved initially, high levels persisted in the long term.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up confirms the lack of added value of rituximab in addition to MBVP and HD-cytarabine for PCNSL.","author":[{"family":"Bromberg","given":"Jacoline E.

Intraretinal and pre-retinal hemorrhages were appreciated, as well as Roth spots and peripheral neovascularization. Initial lab findings were consistent with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, later, upon bone marrow examination, the diagnosis was edited to chronic myeloid leukemia. Dasatinib therapy resulted in a complete hematologic resolution after six weeks. After intravitreal injections of bevacizumab in both eyes, visual acuity improved to 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye.\nConclusion and importance\nAfter review, this is one of only a few reported cases of bilateral blurry vision as the primary presenting symptom of chronic myeloid leukemia in a young adult. Because visual disturbances occur more frequently in acute myeloid leukemia, and lab results may be inconclusive, careful consideration should be given to differentiate myelogenous leukemias, as the acute and chronic subtypes may present similarly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Nathan J."},{"family":"Kaya","given":"Erin A."},{"family":"Haymore","given":"Jonathan G."},{"family":"Gioia","given":"Lauren V."}],"citation-key":"brown_bilateral_2022","container-title":"American Journal of Ophthalmology Case Reports","container-title-short":"Am.

We report updated results from RESONATE in these traditionally chemotherapy resistant high-risk genomic subgroups at a median follow-up of 19 months. Mutations were detected by Foundation One Heme Panel. Baseline mutations in the ibrutinib arm included TP53 (51%), SF3B1 (31%), NOTCH1 (28%), ATM (19%) and BIRC3 (14%). Median PFS was not reached, with 74% of patients randomized to ibrutinib alive and progression-free at 24 months. The improved efficacy of ibrutinib vs ofatumumab continues in all prognostic subgroups including del17p and del11q. No significant difference within the ibrutinib arm was observed for PFS across most genomic subtypes, although a subset carrying both TP53 mutation and del17p had reduced PFS compared with patients with neither abnormality. Reduced PFS or OS was not evident in patients with only del17p. PFS was significantly better for ibrutinib-treated patients in second-line vs later lines of therapy. The robust clinical activity of ibrutinib continues to show ongoing efficacy and acceptable safety consistent with prior reports, independent of various known high-risk mutations.","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Jennifer R."},{"family":"Hillmen","given":"Peter"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Barrientos","given":"Jaqueline C."},{"family":"Reddy","given":"Nishitha"},{"family":"Coutre","given":"S.

We used the data gathered from four randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and intravascular catheter infections in critically ill obese patients.\nMethods:‚ÄÇ Adult obese patients who required short-term central venous, arterial or dialysis catheter insertion in the intensive care unit (ICU) were analyzed. The association between BMI and major catheter-related infection (MCRI), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and catheter tip colonization was estimated using univariate and mul‚Äëtivariate marginal Cox models. Exploratory analysis using dressing disruptions was added.\nResults:‚ÄÇ A total of 2282 obese patients and 4275 catheters from 32 centers were included in this post-hoc analy‚Äësis. Overall, 66 (1.5%) MCRI, 43 (1%) CRBSI and 399 (9.3%) catheter colonizations were identified. The hazard ratio (HR) for MCRI, CRBSI and colonization increased with BMI. After adjustment for well-known infection risk factors, the BMI‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ40 group had an increased risk for MCRI (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.13‚Äì3.12, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.015), CRBSI (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.19‚Äì4.04, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.012) and colonization (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.12‚Äì1.84, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0038) compared to the BMI‚Äâ<‚Äâ40 group.

This study was undertaken to determine ICI efficacy against epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)/c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1)-mutated NSCLC patients in the real-world setting.In this retrospective, multicenter study on adults with ICI-treated EGFR-mutated or ALK- or ROS1-translated NSCLCs, we analyzed clinical characteristics and outcomes: ICI-treatment duration, and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, duration of response, and overall survival (OS) from immunotherapy initiation.Fifty-one NSCLC patients (mean age, 58.0 years) were included from 20 French centers: 61% were never-smokers and 59% were women. Among them, 82% had EGFR-activating mutations, 16% ALK translocations, or 2% ROS1 translocations. Before ICI therapy, patients had received a median of 3 treatment lines (including tyrosine-kinase inhibitor). The median PFS was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-3.2) months for the entire cohort, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4-3.2) for EGFR-mutated patients, and 2.4 (95% CI, 2.1-not reached) months for ALK-translocated patients. The median OS was 14.7 (95% CI, 12.1-19.2) months for the entire population and 13.9 (95% CI, 8.8-20.0) and 19.2 (95% CI, 13.1-not reached) months for EGFR-mutated and ALK-translocated patients, respectively. Seven (13.7%) patients were treated with ICI for >9 months. Toxicities were reported in 22% (11/51), including 8% (4/51) grade ÔøΩÔøΩ3.In this real-world setting, analysis of ICI PFS against EGFR-mutated or ALK-translocated NSCLC patients appeared close to that observed in pretreated unselected NSCLC patients. The more promising OS probably linked to post-ICI treatments. Large prospective studies on these patient subsets are needed.","author":[{"family":"Bylicki","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Guisier","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Monnet","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Doubre","given":"HÁüálÁô°ne"},{"family":"Gervais","given":"Radj"},{"family":"Janicot","given":"H."},{"family":"PÁüárol","given":"Maurice"},{"family":"Fournel","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Lamy","given":"R."},{"family":"Auliac","given":"Jean-Bernard"},{"family":"Chouaid","given":"Christos"}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"bylicki_efficacy_2020","container-title":"Medicine","container-title-short":"Medicine (Baltimore)","DOI":"10.1097/md.0000000000018726","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"e18726-NA","source":"1.6","title":"Efficacy and safety of programmed cell-death-protein-1 and its ligand inhibitors in pretreated patients with epidermal growth-factor receptor-mutated or anaplastic lymphoma kinase-translocated lung adenocarcinoma.","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},

Amivantamab, a fully human bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET, is approved in the United States and other countries for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, for whom disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Preliminary efficacy and safety have also been demonstrated in patients with common EGFR- or MET-mutated NSCLC. Amivantamab employs 3 distinct potential mechanisms of action (MOAs) including ligand blocking, receptor degradation, and immune cell-directing activity, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and trogocytosis. Notably, efficacy with amivantamab does not require all 3 MOAs to occur simultaneously, broadening applicability by using diverse antitumor mechanisms. This review focuses on the molecular characteristics of amivantamab and its unique MOAs leading to in vitro and in vivo efficacy and safety in preclinical and clinical studies.","author":[{"family":"Byoung","given":"Chul"},{"family":"Simi","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Sabari","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Vijayaraghavan","given":"Smruthi"},{"family":"Moores","given":"Sheri"},{"family":"Spira","given":"Alexander Cho"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"byoung_amivantamab_2022","container-title":"Clinical lung cancer","container-title-short":"Clin.

After patient accrual had begun, the trial design was amended in 2003 after bevacizumab phase III data became available. The resulting 2 x 2 factorial design randomly assigned patients to XELOX versus FOLFOX-4, and then to also receive either bevacizumab or placebo. We report here the results of the analysis of the XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 arms. The analysis of bevacizumab versus placebo with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is reported separately. The prespecified primary end point for the noninferiority analysis was progression-free survival.\nRESULTS: The intent-to-treat population comprised 634 patients from the original two-arm portion of the study, plus an additional 1,400 patients after the start of the amended 2 x 2 design, for a total of 2,034 patients. The median PFS was 8.0 months in the pooled XELOX-containing arms versus 8.5 months in the FOLFOX-4-containing arms (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 97.5% CI, 0.93 to 1.16). The median overall survival was 19.8 months with XELOX versus 19.6 months with FOLFOX-4 (HR, 0.99; 97.5% CI, 0.88 to 1.12). FOLFOX-4 was associated with more grade 3/4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia and febrile neutropenia than XELOX, and XELOX with more grade 3 diarrhea and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome than FOLFOX-4.\nCONCLUSION: XELOX is noninferior to FOLFOX-4 as a first-line treatment for MCRC, and may be considered as a routine treatment option for appropriate patients.","author":[{"family":"C","given":"assidy Jim"},{"family":"C","given":"larke Stephen"},{"family":"D","given":"√≠az-Rubio Eduardo"},{"family":"S","given":"cheithauer Werner"},{"family":"F","given":"iger Arie"},{"family":"W","given":"ong Ralph"},{"family":"K","given":"oski Sheryl"},{"family":"L","given":"ichinitser Mikhail"},{"family":"Y","given":"ang Tsai-Shen"},{"family":"R","given":"ivera Fernando"},{"family":"C","given":"outure Felix"},{"family":"S","given":"irz√©n Florin"},{"family":"S","given":"altz Leonard"}],"citation-key":"c_randomized_2008","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2007.14.9898","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"2006-2012","PMID":"18421053","source":"PubMed","title":"Randomized phase III study of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin compared with fluorouracil/folinic acid plus oxaliplatin as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"c_refinement_2016","abstract":"Uniformly adopted response criteria are essential for assessment of therapies incorporating conventional chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Recently, immunomodulatory agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have demonstrated impressive activity in a broad range of lymphoma histologies. However, these agents may be associated with clinical and imaging findings during treatment suggestive of progressive disease (PD) despite evidence of clinical benefit (eg, tumor flare or pseudo-progression). Considering this finding as PD could lead to patients being prematurely removed from a treatment from which they actually stand to benefit. This phenomenon has been well described with checkpoint blockade therapy in solid tumors and anecdotally seen in lymphoma as well. To address this issue in the context of lymphoma immunomodulatory therapy, a workshop was convened to provide provisional recommendations to modify current response criteria in patients receiving these and future agents in clinical trials. The term ‚Äúindeterminate response‚Äù was introduced to identify such lesions until confirmed as flare/pseudo-progression or true PD by either biopsy or subsequent imaging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"C","given":"heson Bruce D."},{"family":"A","given":"nsell Stephen"},{"family":"S","given":"chwartz Larry"},{"family":"G","given":"ordon Leo I."},{"family":"A","given":"dvani Ranjana"},{"family":"J","given":"acene Heather A."},{"family":"H","given":"oos Axel"},{"family":"B","given":"arrington Sally F."},{"family":"A","given":"rmand Philippe"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"c_refinement_2016","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2016-05-718528","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,24]]},"page":"2489-2496","source":"25.476","title":"Refinement of the Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2016-05-718528","volume":"128"},

It is becoming clear that \"persisters,\" a subpopulation of drug-tolerant cells found in cancer populations, play a critical role in the development of drug resistance. Persisters are able to maintain viability under therapy but are typically slow cycling or dormant. These cells do not harbor classic drug resistance driver alterations, and their partial resistance phenotype is transient and reversible upon removal of the drug. In the clinic, the persister state most closely corresponds to minimal residual disease from which relapse can occur if treatment is discontinued or if acquired drug resistance develops in response to continuous therapy. Thus, eliminating persister cells will be crucial to improve outcomes for cancer patients.

Its diagnosis at an early stage is highly necessary and will improve the standard of care of this disease. The aim of this article is to review the importance and applications of next generation sequencing in lung cancer diagnosis. As observed in many studies, next generation sequencing has been proven as a very helpful tool in the early detection of different types of cancers, including lung cancer, and has been used in the clinic, mainly due to its many advantages, such as low cost, speed, efficacy, low quantity usage of biological samples, and diversity.\n\nAbstract\nLung cancer is still one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and one of the deadliest. The high death rate is mainly due to the late stage of diagnosis and low response rate to therapy.

Next generation sequencing has become an essential tool in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of the treatment response. This article aims to review the leading research and clinical applications in lung cancer diagnosis using next generation sequencing. In this scope, we identified the most relevant articles that present the successful use of next generation sequencing in identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis correlated to lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Certain molecular subsets of NSCLC, though gaining greatly from targeted therapy approaches, may derive less benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. The optimal identification, targeting, and sequencing of targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy are essential to continue to improve patient outcomes in advanced NSCLC. Herein, we review the role of immunotherapy in locally advanced and metastatic disease for patients with actionable driver alterations. Never-smoking patients have a high probability of having lung cancer that harbors one of these molecular aberrations that can be matched to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with greatly improved clinical outcomes. Some of these patients with driver mutations may derive less benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor approaches (either alone or combined with chemotherapy), especially compared with smoking-associated NSCLC. Given that PD-1 blockade alone or with platinum-based chemotherapy is the de facto first-line therapy (depending on level of PD-L1 expression) for nontargetable metastatic NSCLC, we also review treatment in never-smoking patients for whom molecular testing results are pending and the likelihood of identifying a driver mutation is high.","author":[{"family":"Calles","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Riess","given":"Jonathan W."},{"family":"Brahmer","given":"Julie R."}],"citation-key":"calles_checkpoint_2020","container-title":"American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

About 5% of NSCLC will be driven by a gene mutation known as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Targeted treatments for those with advanced (not curable) ALK‚Äêmutated NSCLC cancer have been developed and found to be more effective than chemotherapy. The first ALK inhibitor to be developed was crizotinib. Newer ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs have also been developed and include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib.¬†In this review we looked at treatments that target ALK‚Äêmutated NSCLC to find out how well they work., \n          Objectives¬†\n        , The primary objective of this review was to find out whether people with ALK‚Äêmutated NSCLC¬†given treatments targeted towards ALK live longer without recurrence and have fewer side effects than those treated¬†with chemotherapy. We also planned¬†to evaluate whether newer ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs achieve¬†this¬†better¬†than crizotinib.¬†, \n          Study characteristics\n        , We searched the main medical databases and records of conferences up to¬†7¬†January 2021. We found 11 studies¬†(2874 participants): six studies¬†compared an ALK‚Äêtargeted drug to chemotherapy, and five studies¬†compared a newer¬†ALK‚Äêtargeted drug to crizotinib. The studies were conducted¬†in people with advanced ALK‚Äêmutated NSCLC using these drugs as their first or later treatment. A total of five different ALK inhibitors were used across studies: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib., \n          Results\n        , People treated with ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those on chemotherapy. These improvements were also seen in people with cancer that had spread to the brain. People receiving ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs lived longer overall, even when some had received chemotherapy first. ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs cause a similar number of side effects as chemotherapy.¬†ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size and resulted in a longer time until worsening of symptoms when compared to chemotherapy.¬†, People treated with newer ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those receiving crizotinib, including in people with cancer involving the brain. People treated with newer ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs as first treatment were likely to live longer overall with a similar number of overall side effects. Newer ALK‚Äêtargeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size when compared to crizotinib., The evidence for most reported measures was of moderate or high certainty., \n          Conclusions\n        , The best first treatment for people with incurable ALK‚Äêmutated lung cancer is a newer ALK inhibitor such as alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. More studies are needed to determine which of these options is best and what treatment should be used when the cancer grows after these medicines have been given.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Cameron","given":"Laird B"},{"family":"Hitchen","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Chandran","given":"Elias"},{"family":"Morris","given":"Tessa"},{"family":"Manser","given":"Ren√©e"},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Benjamin J"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Vanessa"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"cameron_targeted_2022","container-title":"The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","container-title-short":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD013453.pub2","ISSN":"1469-493X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,7]]},"page":"CD013453","PMCID":"PMC8740884","PMID":"34994987","source":"8.4","title":"Targeted therapy for advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)‚Äêrearranged non‚Äêsmall cell lung cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8740884/","volume":"2022"},
  {"id":"camidge_activity_2012","abstract":"Summary Background ALK fusion genes occur in a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). We assessed the tolerability and activity of crizotinib in patients with NSCLC who were prospectively identified to have an ALK fusion within the first-in-man phase 1 crizotinib study. Methods In this phase 1 study, patients with ALK -positive stage III or IV NSCLC received oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Endpoints included tumour responses, duration of response, time to tumour response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival at 6 and 12 months, and determination of the safety and tolerability and characterisation of the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of crizotinib after oral administration. Responses were analysed in evaluable patients and PFS and safety were analysed in all patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00585195. Findings Between Aug 27, 2008, and June 1, 2011, 149 ALK -positive patients were enrolled, 143 of whom were included in the response-evaluable population. 87 of 143 patients had an objective response (60Áπö8%, 95% CI 52Áπö3ÔøΩÔøΩ68Áπö9), including three complete responses and 84 partial responses. Median time to first documented objective response was 7Áπö9 weeks (range 2Áπö1ÔøΩÔøΩ39Áπö6) and median duration of response was 49Áπö1 weeks (95% CI 39Áπö3ÔøΩÔøΩ75Áπö4). The response rate seemed to be largely independent of age, sex, performance status, or line of treatment. Median PFS was 9Áπö7 months (95% CI 7Áπö7ÔøΩÔøΩ12Áπö8). Median overall survival data are not yet mature, but estimated overall survival at 6 and 12 months was 87Áπö9% (95% CI 81Áπö3ÔøΩÔøΩ92Áπö3) and 74Áπö8% (66Áπö4ÔøΩÔøΩ81Áπö5), respectively. 39 patients continued to receive crizotinib for more than 2 weeks after progression because of perceived ongoing clinical benefit from the drug (12 for at least 6 months from the time of their initial investigator-defined disease progression). Overall, 144 (97%) of 149 patients experienced treatment-related adverse events, which were mostly grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events were visual effects, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, and peripheral oedema. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (n=9), raised alanine aminotransferase (n=6), hypophosphataemia (n=6), and lymphopenia (n=6). Interpretation Crizotinib is well tolerated with rapid, durable responses in patients with ALK -positive NSCLC. There seems to be potential for ongoing benefit after initial disease progression in this population, but a more formal definition of ongoing benefit in this context is needed.

  {"id":"campo_integration_2016","abstract":"UNLABELLED : Genotype-based selection of patients for targeted therapies has had a substantial impact on the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed at cancers driven by oncogenes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements, often achieve dramatic responses and result in prolonged survival compared with chemotherapy. However, TKI resistance invariably develops. Disease progression can be limited to only one or a few sites and might not be symptomatic, raising the important question of whether this type of oligoprogression warrants a change in systemic therapy or consideration of local treatment. Recent clinical observations suggest a growing role for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of oligoprogressive and perhaps even oligopersistent disease (primary and/or metastases) in oncogene-driven NSCLC. SBRT might allow patients to continue with existing TKI treatments longer and delay the need to switch to other systemic options. We review the current data with regard to the use of SBRT for metastatic NSCLC and particularly oncogene-driven disease. Although there is great promise in the marriage of targeted therapies with SBRT, prospective data are urgently needed. In the meantime, such strategies are being used in carefully selected patients, with risk-adapted SBRT dose-fractionation regimens used to optimize the therapeutic index. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or SBRT-like treatments are increasingly being used for oligoprogression in patients with oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer. This approach allows patients to extend the duration of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and has the potential to prolong survival times. Careful patient selection and risk-adapted radiation dosing is of critical importance to minimize toxicity and preserve patient quality of life.","author":[{"family":"Campo","given":"Meghan"},{"family":"Al-Halabi","given":"Hani"},{"family":"Khandekar","given":"Melin J."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Willers","given":"Henning"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"campo_integration_2016","container-title":"The oncologist","DOI":"10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0508","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"964-973","source":"5.8","title":"Integration of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Stage IV Oncogene-Driven Lung Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"carre_role_2019","abstract":"ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only potentially curative option for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) but is severely limited by nonrelapse mortality (NRM), especially in this mostly older population. Comorbidity assessment is crucial to predict NRM and often assessed with the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI). Moreover, the impact of age on NRM still remains a matter of debate. In recent years, the age at which transplants are made has been progressively increasing, and patients with comorbidities have become more common. Extricating the respective roles of age and comorbidities in toxic mortality is all the more important. This study by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry included 1245 adult patients who underwent a first allogeneic stem cell transplantation for MDSs between 2003 and 2014.

We randomly divided 60 patients with low-grade anemic MDS and serum EPO levels lower than 500 IU/L (500 mU/mL) into 2 groups: rHuEPO + rHuG-CSF (arm A) and supportive care (arm B). After 12 weeks, those who had erythroid responses were given rHuEPO alone for 40 additional weeks. They were also given rHuG-CSF if they had relapses. A response was considered major if the hemoglobin (Hb) level was 115 g/L (11.5 g/dL) or higher and minor Hb increase was 15 g/L (1.5 g/dL) or more or if it remained stable without transfusion. Ten of 24 patients responded in arm A, and 0 of 26 responded in arm B (P =.01). Eight patients in arm A continued rHuEPO therapy alone, and 6 had relapses. Responses were always restored when rHuG-CSF was reintroduced. Mean direct costs per patient were 26,723 euros (arm A) and 8,746 euros (arm B). Quality of life was assessed with a Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) scale. Similar percentages of patients from both arms showed significant clinical improvement. rHuEPO plus rHuG-CSF led to responses in 41.7% of MDS patients. This treatment was expensive. No effect on quality of life was demonstrated.","author":[{"family":"Casadevall","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Durieux","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Dubois","given":"St√©phanie"},{"family":"Hemery","given":"Fran√ßois"},{"family":"Lepage","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Quarre","given":"M.C."},{"family":"Damaj","given":"Gandhi"},{"family":"Giraudier","given":"St√©phane"},{"family":"Guerci","given":"Agn√®s"},{"family":"Laurent","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Dombret","given":"Herv√©"},{"family":"Chomienne","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Ribrag","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Stamatoullas","given":"Aspasia"},{"family":"Marie","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Vekhoff","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Maloisel","given":"Fr√©d√©ric"},{"family":"Navarro","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Dreyfus","given":"Fran√ßois"},{"family":"Fenaux","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"casadevall_health_2004","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2003-07-2252","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"321-327","title":"Health, economic, and quality-of-life effects of erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes: a randomized, controlled trial.","type":"article-journal","volume":"104"},

A planned follow-up exploratory analysis of OS was performed.\nRESULTS: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised 2034 patients (two-arm portion, n=634; 2 √ó 2 factorial portion, n=1400). For the whole NO16966 study population, median OS was 19.8 months in the pooled XELOX/XELOX-placebo/XELOX-bevacizumab arms vs 19.5 months in the pooled FOLFOX4/FOLFOX4-placebo/FOLFOX4-bevacizumab arms (hazard ratio 0.95 (97.5% CI 0.85-1.06)). In the pooled XELOX/XELOX-placebo arms, median OS was 19.0 vs 18.9 months in the pooled FOLFOX4/FOLFOX4-placebo arms (hazard ratio 0.95 (97.5% CI 0.83-1.09)). FOLFOX4 was associated with more grade 3/4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia and febrile neutropenia than XELOX, and XELOX with more grade 3 diarrhoea and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome than FOLFOX4.\nCONCLUSION: Updated survival data from study NO16966 show that XELOX is similar to FOLFOX4, confirming the primary analysis of progression-free survival.

  {"id":"catalano_lung_2022","abstract":"Immunotherapy is an ever-expanding Ô¨Åeld in lung cancer treatment research. Over the past two decades, there has been signiÔ¨Åcant progress in identifying immunotherapy targets and creating speciÔ¨Åc therapeutic agents, leading to a major paradigm shift in lung cancer treatment. However, despite the great success achieved with programmed death protein 1/ligand 1 (PD-1/PDL1) monoclonal antibodies and with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), only a minority of lung cancer patients respond to treatment, and of these many subsequently experience disease progression. In addition, immune-related adverse events sometimes can be life-threatening, especially when anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 are used in combination. All of this prompted researchers to identify novel immune checkpoints targets to overcome these limitations. Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoglobulin (Ig) and Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-Based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) domain (TIGIT), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) are promising molecules now under investigation. This review aims to outline the current role of immunotherapy in lung cancer and to examine efÔ¨Åcacy and future applications of the new immune regulating molecules.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Catalano","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Shabani","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Venturini","given":"Jacopo"},{"family":"Ottanelli","given":"Carlotta"},{"family":"Voltolini","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Roviello","given":"Giandomenico"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"catalano_lung_2022","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers14246145","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"language":"en","page":"6145","source":"5.2","title":"Lung Cancer Immunotherapy: Beyond Common Immune Checkpoints Inhibitors","title-short":"Lung Cancer Immunotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/24/6145","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"chaft_evolution_2021","abstract":"The treatment goal for patients with early-stage lung cancer is cure. Multidisciplinary discussions of surgical resectability and medical operability determine the modality of definitive local treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) and the associated systemic therapies to further improve the likelihood of cure. Trial evidence supports cisplatin-based adjuvant therapy either after surgical resection or concurrently with radiotherapy. Consensus guidelines support neoadjuvant chemotherapy in lieu of adjuvant chemotherapy and carboplatin-based regimens for patients who are ineligible for cisplatin. The incorporation of newer agents, now standard for¬†patients with stage IV lung cancer, into the curative therapy paradigm has lagged owing to inefficient trial designs, the lengthy follow-up needed to assess survival end points and a developmental focus on the advanced-stage disease setting. Surrogate end points, such as pathological response, are being studied and might shorten trial durations. In 2018, the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab was approved for patients with stage III lung cancer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Since then, the study of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in patients with early-stage lung cancer has rapidly expanded. In this Review, we present the current considerations in the treatment of patients with early-stage lung cancer and explore the current and future state of clinical research to develop systemic therapies for non-metastatic lung cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Chaft","given":"Jamie E."},{"family":"Rimner","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Weder","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Azzoli","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Kris","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Cascone","given":"Tina"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"chaft_evolution_2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1038/s41571-021-00501-4","ISSN":"1759-4782","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"9","page":"547-557","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"78.8","title":"Evolution of systemic therapy for stages I‚ÄìIII non-metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-021-00501-4","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"chalandon_randomized_2015","abstract":"In this study, we randomly compared high doses of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib combined with reduced-intensity chemotherapy (arm A) to standard imatinib/hyperCVAD (cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone) therapy (arm B) in 268 adults (median age, 47 years) with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The primary objective was the major molecular response (MMolR) rate after cycle 2, patients being then eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) if they had a donor, or autologous SCT if in MMolR and no donor. With fewer induction deaths, the complete remission (CR) rate was higher in arm A than in arm B (98% vs 91%; P = .006), whereas the MMolR rate was similar in both arms (66% vs 64%). With a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 5-year event-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated at 37.1% and 45.6%, respectively, without difference between the arms. Allogeneic transplantation was associated with a significant benefit in relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; P = .036) and OS (HR, 0.64; P = .02), with initial white blood cell count being the only factor significantly interacting with this SCT effect. In patients achieving MMolR, outcome was similar after autologous and allogeneic transplantation. This study validates an induction regimen combining reduced-intensity chemotherapy and imatinib in Ph+ ALL adult patients and suggests that SCT in first CR is still a good option for Ph+ ALL adult patients.

  {"id":"chamuleau_rcodoxm_2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with newly diagnosed high-risk Burkitt lymphoma are treated with high-intensity immune-chemotherapy regimens such as R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC or with lower-intensity regimens such as DA-EPOCH-R. The aim of this study was to make a formal comparison between these regimens.\nMETHODS: This multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised study was done in 26 clinical centres in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk Burkitt lymphoma without CNS involvement. Patients were randomly assigned to two cycles of R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC (R-CODOX-M: rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1 and 9, cyclophosphamide 800 mg/m2 on day 1, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 on days 2-5, vincristine 1¬∑5 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 on day 1, and methotrexate 3000 mg/m2 on day 10; R-IVAC: rituximab 375 mg/m2 on days 3 and 7, iphosphamide 1500 mg/m2 on days 1-5, etoposide 60 mg/m2 on days 1-5, and cytarabin 2000 mg/m2 on day 1 and 2) or six cycles of DA-EPOCH-R (dose-adjusted etoposide 50-124 mg/m2 on days 1-4, prednisolone 120 mg/m2 on days 1-5, vincristine 0¬∑4 mg/m2 on days 1-4, dose-adjusted cyclophosphamide 480-1866 mg/m2 on day 5, dose-adjusted doxorubicin 10-24¬∑8 mg/m2 on days 1-4, rituximab 375 mg/m2 on days 1 and 5). Patients older than 65 years received a dose modified R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC. All drugs were intravenous except for prednisolone, which was oral. Patients also received four intrathecal CNS administrations with cytarabin (70 mg) and four with methotrexate (15 mg). Patients were stratified by centre, leukemic disease, and HIV-positivity. The primary endpoint was progression-fee survival. All analyses were done by modified intention-to-treat, excluding randomly assigned patients who were subsequently found to have CNS involvement or diagnosis other than Burkitt lymphoma at study entry. This study is registered with the European Clinical Trial Register, EudraCT2013-004394-27.\nFINDINGS: Due to a slow accrual, the study was closed prematurely on Nov 15, 2021. Between Aug 4, 2014, and Sept 17, 2021, 89 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC (n=46) or DA-EPOCH-R (n=43). Five patients were excluded after random assignment (three in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group [one diagnosis other than Burkitt lymphoma at study entry according to local pathology and two CNS involvement] and two in the DA-EPOCH-R group [one diagnosis other than Burkitt lymphoma at study entry according to local pathology and one CNS involvement]. 84 remaining patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. 73 (87%) of 84 patients were male, 76 (90%) presented with stage III or IV disease, and nine (11%) had HIV-positive Burkitt lymphoma. Median patient age was 52 years (IQR 37-64). With a median follow-up of 28¬∑5 months (IQR 13¬∑2-43¬∑7), 2-year progression-free survival was 76% (95% CI 60-86%) in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group and 70% (54-82%) in the DA-EPOCH-R group (hazard ratio 1¬∑42, 95% CI 0¬∑63-3¬∑18; p=0¬∑40). There were two deaths in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group (one infection [treatment related] and one due to disease progression [not treatment related]) and one death in the DA-EPOCH-R group (COVID-19 infection [treatment related]). In the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group, four patients went off-protocol because of toxic effects, versus none in the DA-EPOCH-R group. Patients treated with R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC had more infectious adverse events (24 [56%] of 43 patients had at least one grade 3-5 infection vs 14 [34%] of 41 patients in the DA-EPOCH-R group).\nINTERPRETATION: The trial stopped early, but the available data suggest that while DA-EPOCH-R did not result in superior progression-free survival compared with R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC, it was associated with fewer toxic effects and need for supportive care. DA-EPOCH-R appears to be an additional valid therapeutic option for patients with high-risk Burkitt lymphoma without CNS involvement.\nFUNDING: The Dutch Cancer Society and the Schumacher-Kramer Foundation.","author":[{"family":"Chamuleau","given":"Martine E.

Translational research advances now allow such mutations to be inhibited by either receptor monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Whilst empirical chemotherapy with a platinum-doublet remains the gold standard for advanced NSCLC without a known driver mutation, targeted therapy is pushing the boundary to significantly improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

  {"id":"chen_cart_2023","abstract":"The year 2017 was marked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first two chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapies. The approved indications were for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in a second or later relapse. Since then, extensive research activities have been ongoing globally on different hematologic and solid tumors to assess the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy for these diseases. Limitations to CAR-T therapy became apparent from, e.g., the relapse in up to 60% of patients and certain side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This led to extensive clinical activities aimed at overcoming these obstacles, so that the use of CAR-T therapy can be expanded. Attempts to improve on efficacy and safety include changing the CAR-T administration schedule, combining it with chemotherapy, and the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies, e.g., through the use of CAR-natural killer (CAR-NK) and CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms). This review will focus on new CAR-T treatment strategies in hematologic malignancies, clinical trials aimed at improving efficacy and addressing side effects, the challenges that CAR-T therapy faces in solid tumors, and the ongoing research aimed at overcoming these challenges.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yi-Ju"},{"family":"Abila","given":"Bams"},{"family":"Mostafa Kamel","given":"Yasser"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"chen_cart_2023","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/cancers15030663","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"663","PMCID":"PMC9913679","PMID":"36765623","source":"6.575","title":"CAR-T: What Is Next?","title-short":"CAR-T","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"chen_novel_2017","abstract":"Abstract Osimertinib is an irreversible third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and has shown outstanding performances in treating EGFR T790M-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but acquired resistance is inevitable. EGFR C797S is the most notable resistance mechanism to this drug, but other EGFR mutations may also exist. In three lung adenocarcinoma patients resistant to osimertinib, we identified recurrent novel mutations at EGFR Leu792 codon by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of cell free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma or pleural effusion. In two cases with pre-treatment tumor samples tested, mutations at Leu792 were absent, indicating that they were newly acquired during the therapy. Interestingly, all Leu792 mutations are localized at the same gene allele as T790M, but different from C797S. Structural prediction suggests that Leu792 mutations could interrupt the binding of osimerbinib to EGFR and potentially cause drug resistance.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Wenxiang"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xue"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Xiaoling"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Yang W."},{"family":"Qin","given":"Songbing"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Caicun"}],"citation-key":"chen_novel_2017","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"cheng_predictors_2023","abstract":"Childhood immune thrombocytopenia (ITP; platelet count < 100 √ó 109/L) is the most common bleeding disorder in children. A total of 3-5% of children with ITP face a greater risk of bleeding, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Childhood ITP is often benign and self-limited; however, children with severe ITP (platelet count < 30 √ó 109/L) require investigation and monitoring. In addition, 20% of ITP patients may not go into remission (platelet counts < 100 √ó 109/L by 12 months after diagnosis) and may develop chronic ITP. The early identifying predictors associated with the resolution of severe ITP at the time of diagnosis may be helpful for family guidance. However, there is still controversy about the associations between the clinical factors at the time of initial diagnosis and the definitions of disease remission assessed at different timepoints after diagnosis. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the shared clinical factors among the disease remission definitions at three arbitrarily set timepoints-3, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis. This study retrieved records for hospitalized children aged under 18 years and diagnosed with ITP from the hospital registry in a tertiary university hospital. Clinical variables were recorded by reviewing the medical records with structured data entry for ITP admission. The serial follow-up platelet counts within 12 months after diagnosis were recorded. The times of ITP remission were identified by experienced pediatric hematologists. Patients with mild-form ITP (platelet counts ‚â• 30 √ó 109/L) at diagnosis or who were lost to follow-up within 3 months were excluded. From 1988 to 2019, 546 children were enrolled, and a total of 497 children with severe ITP were included in the further analysis. In total, one (0.2%) died of an intracranial hemorrhage, 363 (73.2%) children went into remission at 3 months, 40 (8.1%) went into remission between 6 and 12 months, and 104 (20.9%) developed chronic ITP. The shared significant predictors for remission by the third, sixth, and twelfth months included pre-adolescent age (<10 years) at diagnosis, abrupt onset (duration of symptoms prior to admission ‚â§ 2 weeks), and speedy recovery (platelet count > 100 √ó 109/L at 1 month post diagnosis). ITP patients with positive viral serology tests or vaccination within 4 weeks had trends of delayed remission. In conclusion, diagnosis before preadolescent age, abrupt onset, and speedy recovery may share favorable factors for the remission of childhood ITP assessed at different timepoints.","author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Chao-Neng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yuan-Ning"},{"family":"Yeh","given":"Yun-Hsuan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Li-Wen"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jiann-Shiuh"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Yung-Chieh"}],"citation-key":"cheng_predictors_2023","container-title":"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)","container-title-short":"Diagn.

This heterogeneity is a challenge for evaluating response to treatment. Therapeutic trials in MDS have used various criteria to assess results, making cross-study comparisons problematic. In 2000, an International Working Group (IWG) proposed standardized response criteria for evaluating clinically significant responses in MDS. These criteria included measures of alteration in the natural history of disease, hematologic improvement, cytogenetic response, and improvement in health-related quality of life. The relevance of the response criteria has now been validated prospectively in MDS clinical trials, and they have gained acceptance in research studies and in clinical practice. Because limitations of the IWG criteria have surfaced, based on practical and reported experience, some modifications were warranted.

In 1988, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group published the first widely accepted criteria for CLL,1 which were revised in 1996.2 Such recommendations were developed in the context of currently available cytotoxic therapies. Later, in 2008, the International Workshop on CLL published criteria that incorporated much of the 1996 guidelines but also included guidance on how to assess minimal residual disease after therapy.3 These published guidelines defined therapy outcome as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), based on surrogate markers of tumor burden, such as blood lymphocyte count, lymph node size, or spleen size, and indicators of improved marrow function or clearance of leukemia cells from the marrow, as assessed by serial blood counts and/or marrow aspirate and biopsy. In general, these response criteria (CR, PR, SD, and PD) in therapeutic trials have correlated with the length of progression-free survival (PFS) and occasionally overall survival after treatment. Because assessment of response using these criteria can often be made years before survival data are available, response criteria have served as useful surrogate markers for assessing the clinical benefit of therapy, thereby accelerating the pace of approval of novel agents for use in the treatment of patients.","author":[{"family":"Cheson","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Byrd","given":"John C."},{"family":"R.","given":"Kanti"},{"family":"Kay","given":"Neil E."},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Flinn","given":"Ian W."},{"family":"Wiestner","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Kipps","given":"Thomas J."}],"citation-key":"cheson_novel_2012","container-title":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"chiaretti_multicenter_2021","abstract":"The GIMEMA LAL1509 protocol, designed for adult (ÔøΩÔøΩ18-60 years) de novo Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, was based on a dasatinib plus steroids induction - with central nervous system prophylaxis - followed by dasatinib alone in patients in complete molecular response or chemotherapy and/or allogeneic transplantation in patients not reaching a complete molecular response. Sixty patients (median age 41.9 years) were enrolled: 33 were p190+, 18 p210+ and 9 p190/p210+. At the end of induction (day +85), 58 patients (97%) achieved a complete hematologic remission. No deaths in induction were recorded. Eleven patients (18.3%) obtained a complete molecular response. Among non-complete molecular responders (n=47), 22 underwent an allogeneic transplant. Seventeen hematologic relapses occurred (median 7 months, range 3-40.1), 13 during consolidation and 4 post-transplant. ABL1 mutations (5 T315I, 3 V299L, 1 E281K and 1 G254E) were found in 10/13 relapsed cases. With a median follow-up of 57.4 months (range: 4.2-75.6), overall survival and disease-free survival are 56.3% and 47.2%. A better diseasefree survival was observed in patients who obtained a molecular response at day +85 compared to cases who did not. The presence of additional copy number aberrations - IKZF1 plus CDKN2A/B and/or PAX5 deletions - was the most important unfavorable prognostic factor on overall and disease-free survival (p=0.005 and p=0.0008). This study shows that in adult Ph+ ALL long-term survivals can be achieved with a total-therapy strategy based on a chemo-free induction and, in complete molecular responders, also without further systemic chemotherapy. Finally, the screening of additional copy number aberrations should be included in the diagnostic work-up.

  {"id":"chiel_bridge_2022","abstract":"Purpose¬†\n        Clinical fellows, those training to become subspecialists in a program certified by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, supervise residents on inpatient subspecialty rotations. Unlike for supervising residents or for faculty, there is a paucity of literature describing fellows‚Äô supervision of residents. The aim of this study was to understand residents‚Äô and fellows‚Äô perception of successful supervision of residents by fellows on inpatient subspecialty rotations to inform the development of curricula to support fellows as supervisors.\n        Method¬†\n        Using grounded theory methodology, the authors held focus groups in May 2020 of pediatric residents and pediatric subspecialty fellows at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. Focus groups were conducted until thematic saturation was achieved. Deidentified transcripts were independently coded by 2 authors. The author team consolidated the codes into themes and developed an interpretive model for fellows‚Äô successful supervision of residents. Key results were confirmed via member checking.\n        Results¬†\n        The authors conducted 4 resident focus groups, composed of 16 pediatric residents, and 4 fellow focus groups, composed of 13 pediatric subspecialty fellows. Participants perceived that fellows who provided successful resident supervision advanced residents‚Äô professional growth and supported residents‚Äô development along 5 ‚Äúbridges‚Äù: (1) generalist to subspecialist, (2) trainee to autonomous practitioner, (3) individual to member of the interprofessional team, (4) emerging physician to patient-facing care provider, and (5) newcomer to engaged clinical learner. Fellows can further residents‚Äô growth in these areas by demonstrating approachability, empathy, appreciation, and kindness.\n        Conclusions¬†\n        As newcomers on inpatient subspecialty rotations, residents engage in legitimate peripheral participation. Fellows who are successful supervisors move residents toward full participation in their profession via the bridge model. The fellow-resident dynamic carries advantages of near-peer learning. Fellows can harness their role, subspecialty knowledge, and familiarity with the training environment to enhance resident supervision.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Chiel","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Winthrop","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Huth","given":"Kathleen"},{"family":"Gross","given":"Caroline J."},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Marcus","given":"Carolyn H."},{"family":"Winn","given":"Ariel S."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"chiel_bridge_2022","container-title":"Academic Medicine","container-title-short":"Acad.

Amivantamab, an EGFR and MET bispecific antibody, demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC with Exon20ins following platinum-based therapy in CHRYSALIS (NCT02609776; Cohort D+). Since CHRYSALIS was single-arm, individual patient data (IPD)-based adjusted analyses versus similar patients in real-world clinical practice (RWCP) were conducted to generate comparative evidence.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\">RWCP cohorts were derived from seven European and US real-world sources, comprising patients fulfilling CHRYSALIS Cohort D+ eligibility criteria. Amivantamab was compared with a basket of RWCP treatments.

Balance between cohorts was assessed using standardized mean differences (SMDs). Overall response rate (ORR; investigator- [INV] and independent review committee-assessed [IRC]), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS; INV and IRC) and time-to-next treatment (TTNT) were compared.

  {"id":"chris_immunohistochemistry_2013","abstract":"Introduction Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the standard procedure for the detection of anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) rearrangement in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) but is expensive and time consuming. We tested three antibodies to ALK, using various detection systems, and hypothesized that ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) may represent a cost-effective and efficient means of screening for ALK rearrangement in NSCLC. Methods We screened 377 stage I or II NSCLC cases in a tissue microarray by FISH and IHC (5A4 [Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne, UYnited Kingdom] by Nichirei's N-Histofine ALK detection kit [Nichirei Biosciences inc., Tokyo, Japan], 5A4 by Novocastra with ADVANCE [Dako Canada inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada], D5F3 by Cell Signaling Technology with ADVANCE [Cell Signalling Technologies inc., Danvers, MA], and DAKO clone ALK1 with FLEX [Dako Canada inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada] and ADVANCE). IHC was scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+. Possibly positive or positive cases were further analyzed by IHC and FISH on whole section. Results Tissue microarray results were available on 377 cases by IHC and 273 cases by FISH. Eleven cases were positive or possibly positive by either IHC or FISH, and three cases were positive or possibly positive by both methods. Three cases were ALK-positive by FISH on whole section validation. There was no correlation between semiquantitative IHC score (1+, 2+, 3+) and ALK rearrangement by FISH. D5F3 (Cell Signaling by ADVANCE) and 5A4 (Novocastra by ADVANCE) showed the greatest combination of sensitivity (100%) and specificity (87.5% for 5A4 by Novocastra and 75% for D5F3 by Cell Signaling), and produced no false-negative results. Conclusions IHC is a reliable screening tool for identification of ALK rearrangement in NSCLC and is antibody dependent. D5F3 (Cell Signaling) and 5A4 (Novocastra) can be used with FISH for identification of IHC-positive cases to reduce screening costs.","author":[{"family":"Chris","given":"M.J."},{"family":"Craddock","given":"Kenneth J."},{"family":"Have","given":"Cherry"},{"family":"Laskin","given":"Janessa"},{"family":"Couture","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Ionescu","given":"Diana N.

  {"id":"clerici_levofloxacin_2023","abstract":"Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis‚Äôs (FQ-P) usefulness in patients with neutropenia is controversial. In recent decades, Italian epidemiological data has shown worrisome rates of FQ resistance. A single-center cohort study on 136 autologous stem cell transplantations (ASCTs) and 223 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (allo-HSCTs) was performed from January 2018 to December 2020. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the first-line therapy for febrile neutropenia (FN). Since February 2019, FQ-P has been omitted. We evaluated the day¬†+30 posttransplant cumulative incidence function (CIF) of gram-negative bacteria pre-engraftment bloodstream infections (PE-BSIs) and any changes in antimicrobial resistance, FN, and infection-related mortality (IRM). In ASCTs, ‚â•1 FN episode occurred in 74.3% of transplants, without differences among groups (P = .66). CIF of gram-negative bacteria PE-BSI was 10.1%, with a significant difference according to FQ-P (0% [LEVO-group] vs 14.1% [NO-LEVO-group], P = .016). CIF of IRM was 0% in both groups. In allo-HSCTs, ‚â•1 FN episode occurred in 96.4% of transplants, without differences among groups (P = .72).

Comparing antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacteria of allo-HSCT setting, in the group without FQ-P, a significantly higher proportion of pathogens was susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (71% vs 30%, P = .026), FQ (49% vs 10%, P = .03), and carbapenems (95% vs 50%, P = .001).

  {"id":"colclough_preclinical_2020","abstract":"Purpose: Osimertinib is a potent and selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) of both sensitizing and T790M resistance mutations. To treat metastatic brain disease, bloodÔøΩÂºérain barrier (BBB) permeability is considered desirable for increasing clinical efficacy. Experimental Design: We examined the level of brain penetration for 16 irreversible and reversible EGFR-TKIs using multiple in vitro and in vivo BBB preclinical models. Results: In vitro osimertinib was the weakest substrate for human BBB efflux transporters (efflux ratio 3.2). In vivo rat free brain to free plasma ratios (Kpuu) show osimertinib has the most BBB penetrance (0.21), compared with the other TKIs (Kpuu ÔøΩÔøΩ 0.12). PET imaging in Cynomolgus macaques demonstrated osimertinib was the only TKI among those tested to achieve significant brain penetrance (Cmax %ID 1.5, brain/blood Kp 2.6). Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy images of brains from mouse PC9 macrometastases models showed osimertinib readily distributes across both healthy brain and tumor tissue. Comparison of osimertinib with the poorly BBB penetrant afatinib in a mouse PC9 model of subclinical brain metastases showed only osimertinib has a significant effect on rate of brain tumor growth. Conclusions: These preclinical studies indicate that osimertinib can achieve significant exposure in the brain compared with the other EGFR-TKIs tested and supports the ongoing clinical evaluation of osimertinib for the treatment of EGFR-mutant brain metastasis. This work also demonstrates the link between low in vitro transporter efflux ratios and increased brain penetrance in vivo supporting the use of in vitro transporter assays as an early screen in drug discovery.","author":[{"family":"Colclough","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kan"},{"family":"JohnstrÁππm","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Strittmatter","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Yumei"},{"family":"Wrigley","given":"Gail L."},{"family":"Schou","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Goodwin","given":"Richard J.

  {"id":"constine_role_2018","abstract":"Relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) challenges clinicians to devise treatment strategies that are effective and safe. This problem is particularly prominent in an era when de-escalation trials are designed to minimize therapeutic toxicities in both early- and advanced-stage disease. Radiation therapy is the single most effective treatment modality for HL, and its integration into salvage regimens, or its independent use in select patients, must be understood to maximize our success in treating these patients. The complexity of treating relapsed or refractory HL derives from the spectrum of primary treatment approaches currently in use that creates heterogeneity in both treatment exposure and the potential toxicities of salvage therapy. Patients can have relapsed or refractory disease after limited or aggressive primary therapy (with or without radiation therapy), at early or delayed time points, with limited or extensive disease volumes, and with varying degrees of residual morbidity from primary therapy.Their response to salvage systemic therapy can be partial or complete, and the use of consolidative stem cell transplantation is variably applied. New biologics and immunotherapeutic approaches have broadened but also complicated salvage treatment approaches. Through all of this, radiation therapy remains an integral component of treatment for many patients, but it must be used effectively and judiciously. The purpose of this review is to describe the different treatment scenarios and provide guidance for radiation dose, volume, and timing in patients with relapsed or refractory HL.","author":[{"family":"Constine","given":"Louis S."},{"family":"Yahalom","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Ng","given":"Andrea K."},{"family":"Hodgson","given":"David C."},{"family":"Wirth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Wirth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Milgrom","given":"Sarah A."},{"family":"Mikhaeel","given":"N.

  {"id":"conti_abstract_2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80% of lung cancers, the second leading cause of cancer deaths globally. Mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are genomic drivers in a molecular sub-type of NSCLC that is sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Third-generation, irreversible TKIs, such as osimertinib and lazertinib, have become standard of care and are now widely used as first-line therapy in EGFR-driven metastatic NSCLC. However, resistance invariably arises during treatment. The C797S mutation is the most frequent on-target resistance mechanism in response to third-generation TKIs when used in the first-line setting. There are currently no approved therapies for patients who progress with a C797S mutation. Although first-generation TKIs inhibit EGFR with a C797S mutation, they carry liabilities of 1) insufficient selectivity over wild-type (WT) EGFR, which precludes maximal target coverage and results in dose-limiting adverse events; and 2) limited brain penetration. METHODS: BLU-701 activity was tested in biochemical assays for EGFR mutants and EGFR WT. Cellular activity was evaluated by a phosphorylation specific EGFR AlphaLisa assay in WT cell lines or those expressing EGFR mutations. The in vivo antitumor activity of BLU-701 was assessed in a PC9 ex19del cell line-derived tumor xenograft (CDX) model. RESULTS: We have developed an orally available, single-digit nanomolar, brain-penetrant, WT-sparing, reversible EGFR inhibitor that is active against the C797S resistance mutation. BLU-701 is equally potent against both the sensitizing mutations ex19del and L858R, and the resistance double mutants ex19del/C797S and L858R/C797S. BLU-701 is brain penetrant (Kpu,u >0.9) and demonstrates a selectivity over WT EGFR that compares favorably with osimertinib. Oral administration of BLU-701 to PC9 ex19del tumor-bearing mice resulted in strong and prolonged pathway suppression and tumor regression at tolerated doses. CONCLUSION: Due to its potent pharmacological activity and selectivity for mutant EGFR, BLU-701 has the potential to demonstrate activity in first-line and resistance settings as a single agent and in combination therapy, addressing potential tumor heterogeneity. The pre-clinical data described here supports the clinical development of BLU-701 in EGFR-driven NSCLC.

  {"id":"cooper_thirdgeneration_2022","abstract":"The discoveries of EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements as actionable oncogenic drivers in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has propelled a biomarker-directed treatment paradigm for patients with advanced-stage disease. Numerous EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with demonstrated efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant and ALK-rearranged NSCLCs have been developed, culminating in the availability of the highly effective third-generation TKIs osimertinib and lorlatinib, respectively. Despite their marked efficacy, resistance to these agents remains an unsolved fundamental challenge. Both ‚Äòon-target‚Äô mechanisms (largely mediated by acquired resistance mutations in the kinase domains of EGFR or ALK) and ‚Äòoff-target‚Äô mechanisms of resistance (mediated by non-target kinase alterations such as bypass signalling activation or phenotypic transformation) have been identified in patients with disease progression on osimertinib or lorlatinib. A growing understanding of the biology and spectrum of these mechanisms of resistance has already begun to inform the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. In this Review, we discuss the development of third-generation EGFR and ALK inhibitors, predominant mechanisms of resistance, and approaches to tackling resistance in the clinic, ranging from novel fourth-generation TKIs to combination regimens and other investigational therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cooper","given":"Alissa J."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jessica J."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"cooper_thirdgeneration_2022","container-title":"Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1038/s41571-022-00639-9","ISSN":"1759-4782","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 Springer Nature Limited","note":"titleTranslation: Á¨¨‰∏â‰ª£ EGFR Âíå ALK ÊäëÂà∂ÂäëÔºöÊäóËó•ÊÄßÊ©üÂà∂ÂíåÊ≤ªÁôÇ","number":"8","page":"499-514","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"78.8","title":"Third-generation EGFR and ALK inhibitors: mechanisms of resistance and management","title-short":"Third-generation EGFR and ALK inhibitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-022-00639-9","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"cortot_resistance_2012","abstract":"The clinical efficacy of EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib is limited by the development of drug resistance. The most common mechanism of drug resistance is the secondary EGFR T790M mutation. Strategies to overcome EGFR T790M-mediated drug resistance include the use of mutant selective EGFR inhibitors, including WZ4002, or the use of high concentrations of irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors such as PF299804. In the current study, we develop drug-resistant versions of the EGFR-mutant PC9 cell line, which reproducibly develops EGFR T790M as a mechanism of drug resistance to gefitinib. Neither PF299804-resistant nor WZ4002-resistant clones of PC9 harbor EGFR T790M. Instead, they have shown activated insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling as a result of loss of expression of IGFBP3 with the IGF1R inhibitor, BMS 536924, restoring EGFR inhibitor sensitivity. Intriguingly, prolonged exposure to either PF299804 or WZ4002 results in the emergence of a more drug-resistant subclone that exhibits ERK activation. A MEK inhibitor, CI-1040, partially restores sensitivity to the EGFR/IGF1R inhibitor combination. Moreover, an IGF1R or MEK inhibitor used in combination with either PF299804 or WZ4002 completely prevents the emergence of drug-resistant clones in this model system. Our studies suggest that more effective means of inhibiting EGFR T790M will prevent the emergence of this common drug resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. However, multiple drug resistance mechanisms can still emerge. Preventing the emergence of drug resistance, by targeting pathways that become activated in resistant cancers, may be a more effective clinical strategy.","author":[{"family":"Cortot","given":"Alexis B."},{"family":"Repellin","given":"Claire E."},{"family":"Shimamura","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Capelletti","given":"Marzia"},{"family":"Zejnullahu","given":"Kreshnik"},{"family":"Ercan","given":"Dalia"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"James G."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Kwok-Kin"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Nathanael S."},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"cortot_resistance_2012","container-title":"Cancer research","container-title-short":"Cancer Res.","DOI":"10.1158/0008-5472.can-12-2066","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"834-843","source":"11.2","title":"Resistance to Irreversible EGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors through a Multistep Mechanism Involving the IGF1R Pathway","type":"article-journal","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"creelan_phase_2020","abstract":"Background EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induce cytolysis and release of tumour proteins, which can stimulate antigen-specific T cells. The safety and efficacy of durvalumab and gefitinib in combination for TKI-naive patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC was evaluated. Methods This Phase 1 open-label, multicentre trial (NCT02088112) was conducted in 56 patients with NSCLC. Dose expansion permitted TKI-naive patients, primarily with activating L858R or Ex19del EGFRm. Arms 1 + 1a received concurrent therapy; Arm 2 received 4 weeks of gefitinib induction followed by concurrent therapy. Results From dose escalation, the recommended dose of durvalumab was 10 mg/kg Q2W with 250 mg QD gefitinib. Pharmacokinetics were as expected, consistent with inhibition of soluble PD-L1 and no treatment-emergent immunogenicity. In dose expansion, 35% of patients had elevated liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation. In Arms 1 + 1a, objective response rate was 63.3% (95% CI: 43.9-80.1), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.1 months (95% CI: 5.5-15.2) and median response duration was 9.2 months (95% CI: 3.7-14.0). Conclusions Durvalumab and gefitinib in combination had higher toxicity than either agent alone. No significant increase in PFS was detected compared with historical controls. Therefore, concurrent PD-L1 inhibitors with gefitinib should be generally avoided in TKI-naive patients with EGFRm NSCLC.","author":[{"family":"Creelan","given":"Benjamin C."},{"family":"Yeh","given":"Tammie C."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sang We"},{"family":"Nogami","given":"Naoyuki"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dong Wan"},{"family":"Chow","given":"Laura Q.M."},{"family":"Kanda","given":"Shintaro"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Rosemary"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Weifeng"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Mei"},{"family":"Angell","given":"Helen K."},{"family":"Roudier","given":"Martine P."},{"family":"Marotti","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Gibbons","given":"Don L."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"creelan_phase_2020","container-title":"British journal of cancer","container-title-short":"Br.

  {"id":"creignou_transfusion_2022","abstract":"Background: The cumulative red blood cells (RBC) transfusion burden is known to impact outcomes in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but doesn't accurately predict prognosis during the early disease phase. Here we aimed to assess the prognostic value of early changes in transfusion patterns in addition to the recent IPSS-M scoring system. Methods: We gathered diagnostic biobank samples from adult patients (pts) with MDS and registered in the Karolinska Institute's biobank (KI) and the National Swedish MDS Biobank (NB) between 2003-2017 and 2013-2017, respectively. DNA targeted sequencing (152 genes) was performed (Bernard et al., NEJM Evid, 2022). Clinical data was retrieved through pts‚Äô charts (KI) and the Swedish cancer registry (NB). Pts were treated according to Nordic/EU guidelines and most common therapies for lower-risk MDS and higher-risk MDS were erythropoietin and azacytidine, respectively. Transfusion data was obtained from the SCANDAT registry. Pts were followed with regards to RBC transfusion until censored due to death, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML-t), allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), or end of follow-up on the 31st of August 2018, whichever occurred first. As per the IWG hematological response criteria for MDS (Platzbecker et al., Blood 2019), transfusion states (TS) were categorized every 4 months (m) as transfusion dependent (TD) or transfusion free (TF) during the past 4 m period. Lower-risk MDS (LR) was defined as IPSS-M very low, low and moderate low, and higher-risk MDS (HR) as IPSS-M very high, high and moderate high at diagnosis (Bernard et al., NEJM Evid, 2022). Landmark analyses of overall survival (OS) were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method for estimating probabilities of OS over time. Multivariable analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards model. Results: We gathered a cohort of 688 pts with MDS from KI (n=424) and 33 other clinics in Sweden (NB, n=264). Median age at diagnosis was 74 years (y) old (range 19-93). The male:female ratio in the cohort was 1.4. At diagnosis, 63% of the pts were TF. Out of 646 pts evaluable by the IPSS-M score at diagnosis 54% had LR. Most frequently mutated genes in the cohort were TET2, SF3B1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, RUNX1, TET2, TP53 (66% TP53 multihit), U2AF1, STAG2, ZRSR2. Changes between TS (transitions) preferentially occurred within a year after diagnosis (panel A) with a median time for occurrence of transfusion-related transitions of 1.0 y (range 0.33-8.37). Based on this finding, we assessed whether TS at 8 m landmark impacted prognosis. We observed that there was a significant difference in OS since landmark between TF pts compared with TD pts at landmark 8 m and across IPSS-M categories (panel B). LR pts who were TD at 8 m, had a median OS of 3.2 y (95% CI: 2.2-4.0) versus 6.9 y (95% CI: 5.6-8.9) for LR pts who were TF (P<0.0001). Similarly, median OS was 0.8 y (95% CI: 0.6-1.1) in HR and TD pts while it was 2.4 y (95% CI: 2.1-3.1) in HR and TF pts at landmark 8 m (P<0.0001). Interestingly, OS for LR pts who were TD didn't significantly differ from HR pts who were TF at 8 m. Overall, pts TD at 8 m had more gene mutations compared to TF pts (median 5 [1;13] and 4 [1;16], respectively, P=0.0084). Moreover, studying specific genetic subgroups of MDS, TS at 8 m distinguished subsets of pts with adverse or favorable outcomes within SF3B1-mutated LR pts. In this population, the median OS in pts TF at 8 m was 8.4 y (95% CI: 6.5-13.1) compared to 3.2 y (95% CI: 1.7-4.1) for TD pts (P<0.0001). Next, in multivariable analysis, we found that TD at 8 m significantly impacted OS (HR=2.4 [95% CI: 1.9-3.1]), independently of diagnostic IPSS-M score, age, gender and type of MDS (de novo or therapy-related). Conclusion: TS at landmark 8 m, usually after outcome of first-line treatment was evaluated, appears to be a strong and independent predictor of OS in MDS. These findings are of particular importance for the LR group in which it could discriminate subsets with favorable outcomes from those with adverse prognosis. In addition to the IPSS-M calculation at diagnosis, transfusion dependency could be easily used for prognostic reassessment during follow-up. More generally, these results highlight the need of dynamic outcomes prediction tools and/or validation of current prognostic scores in dynamic settings. Finally, multistate modeling of the dataset is being completed and aims to assess how changes of transfusion patterns over time impact prognosis.

SCHOLAR-1, an international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research study, retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with refractory DLBCL which, for this study, was defined as progressive disease or stable disease as best response at any point during chemotherapy (>4 cycles of first-line or 2 cycles of later-line therapy) or relapsed at ÔøΩÔøΩ12 months from autologous stem cell transplantation. SCHOLAR-1 pooled data from 2 phase 3 clinical trials (Lymphoma Academic Research Organization-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center and University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence). Response rates and overall survival were estimated from the time of initiation of salvage therapy for refractory disease. Among 861 patients, 636 were included on the basis of refractory disease inclusion criteria. For patients with refractory DLBCL, the objective response rate was 26% (complete response rate, 7%) to the next line of therapy, and the median overall survival was 6.3 months. Twenty percent of patients were alive at 2 years. Outcomes were consistently poor across patient subgroups and study cohorts. SCHOLAR-1 is the largest patient-level pooled retrospective analysis to characterize response rates and survival for a population of patients with refractory DLBCL.","author":[{"family":"Crump","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Neelapu","given":"Sattva S."},{"family":"Farooq","given":"Umar"},{"family":"Van","given":"Den Neste Eric"},{"family":"Kuruvilla","given":"John"},{"family":"Westin","given":"Jason R."},{"family":"Link","given":"Brian K."},{"family":"Hay","given":"Annette E."},{"family":"Cerhan","given":"James R."},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Liting"},{"family":"Boussetta","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Maurer","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Navale","given":"Lynn"},{"family":"Wiezorek","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Go","given":"William Y."},{"family":"Gisselbrecht","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"crump_outcomes_2017","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2017-03-769620","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"1800-1808","title":"Outcomes in refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: results from the international SCHOLAR-1 study","type":"article-journal","volume":"130"},
  {"id":"crystal_patientderived_2014","abstract":"Targeted cancer therapies have produced substantial clinical responses, but most tumors develop resistance to these drugs. Here, we describe a pharmacogenomic platform that facilitates rapid discovery of drug combinations that can overcome resistance. We established cell culture models derived from biopsy samples of lung cancer patients whose disease had progressed while on treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and then subjected these cells to genetic analyses and a pharmacological screen. Multiple effective drug combinations were identified. For example, the combination of ALK and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors was active in an ALK -positive resistant tumor that had developed a MAP2K1 activating mutation, and the combination of EGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors was active in an EGFR mutant resistant cancer with a mutation in FGFR3 . Combined ALK and SRC (pp60c-src) inhibition was effective in several ALK-driven patient-derived models, a result not predicted by genetic analysis alone. With further refinements, this strategy could help direct therapeutic choices for individual patients.","author":[{"family":"Crystal","given":"Adam S."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Friboulet","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Niederst","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Lockerman","given":"Elizabeth L."},{"family":"Frias","given":"Rosa L."},{"family":"Gainor","given":"Justin F."},{"family":"Amzallag","given":"Arnaud"},{"family":"Greninger","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Dana"},{"family":"Kalsy","given":"Anuj"},{"family":"Gomez-Caraballo","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Elamine","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Howe","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Hur","given":"Wooyoung"},{"family":"Lifshits","given":"Eugene"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Hayley"},{"family":"Katayama","given":"Ryohei"},{"family":"Faber","given":"Anthony C."},{"family":"Awad","given":"Mark M."},{"family":"Ramaswamy","given":"Sridhar"},{"family":"Mino-Kenudson","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Iafrate","given":"A.

Because the optimal timing of HLA-matched BMT for MDS is unknown, we constructed a Markov model to examine 3 transplantation strategies for newly diagnosed MDS: transplantation at diagnosis, transplantation at leukemic progression, and transplantation at an interval from diagnosis but prior to leukemic progression. Analyses using individual patient risk-assessment data from transplantation and nontransplantation registries were performed for all 4 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups with adjustments for quality of life (QoL). For low and intermediate-1 IPSS groups, delayed transplantation maximized overall survival. Transplantation prior to leukemic transformation was associated with a greater number of life years than transplantation at the time of leukemic progression. In a cohort of patients under the age of 40 years, an even more marked survival advantage for delayed transplantation was noted. For intermediate-2 and high IPSS groups, transplantation at diagnosis maximized overall survival. No changes in the optimal transplantation strategies were noted when QoL adjustments were incorporated. For low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS, delayed BMT is associated with maximal life expectancy, whereas immediate transplantation for intermediate-2- and high-risk disease is associated with maximal life expectancy.","author":[{"family":"Cutler","given":"Corey"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Stephanie J."},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Deeg","given":"H.

  {"id":"dagogo-jack_crizotinib_2016","abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged lung cancer is associated with significant response to crizotinib. However, resistance to crizotinib typically develops within 1-2 years. Preclinical studies and biopsies of resistant sites have demonstrated that diverse mechanisms underlie resistance. Insight into resistance mechanisms has facilitated development of next-generation inhibitors and led to therapeutic combination strategies, several of which are being tested in the clinic., In 2007, a chromosomal rearrangement resulting in a gene fusion leading to expression of a constitutively active anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein was identified as an oncogenic driver in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ALK rearrangements are detected in 3%‚Äì7% of patients with NSCLC and are particularly enriched in younger patients with adenocarcinoma and a never or light smoking history. Fortuitously, crizotinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor initially developed to target cMET, was able to be repurposed for ALK-rearranged (ALK+) NSCLC. Despite dramatic and durable initial responses to crizotinib; however, the vast majority of patients will develop resistance within a few years. Diverse molecular mechanisms underlie resistance to crizotinib. This review will describe the clinical activity of crizotinib, review identified mechanisms of crizotinib resistance, and end with a survey of emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming crizotinib resistance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Dagogo-Jack","given":"I."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"A.

  {"id":"dagogo-jack_met_2020","abstract":"Purpose: Most ALK-positive lung cancers will develop ALK-independent resistance after treatment with next-generation ALK inhibitors. MET amplification has been described in patients progressing on ALK inhibitors, but frequency of this event has not been comprehensively assessed. Experimental Design: We performed FISH and/or next-generation sequencing on 207 posttreatment tissue (n = 101) or plasma (n = 106) specimens from patients with ALK-positive lung cancer to detect MET genetic alterations. We evaluated ALK inhibitor sensitivity in cell lines with MET alterations and assessed antitumor activity of ALK/MET blockade in ALK-positive cell lines and 2 patients with MET-driven resistance. Results: MET amplification was detected in 15% of tumor biopsies from patients relapsing on next-generation ALK inhibitors, including 12% and 22% of biopsies from patients progressing on second-generation inhibitors or lorlatinib, respectively. Patients treated with a second-generation ALK inhibitor in the first-line setting were more likely to develop MET amplification than those who had received next-generation ALK inhibitors after crizotinib (P = 0.019). Two tumor specimens harbored an identical ST7-MET rearrangement, one of which had concurrent MET amplification. Expressing ST7-MET in the sensitive H3122 ALK-positive cell line induced resistance to ALK inhibitors that was reversed with dual ALK/MET inhibition. MET inhibition resensitized a patient-derived cell line harboring both ST7-MET and MET amplification to ALK inhibitors. Two patients with ALK-positive lung cancer and acquired MET alterations achieved rapid responses to ALK/MET combination therapy. Conclusions: Treatment with next-generation ALK inhibitors, particularly in the first-line setting, may lead to MET-driven resistance. Patients with acquired MET alterations may derive clinical benefit from therapies that target both ALK and MET.","author":[{"family":"Dagogo-Jack","given":"Ibiayi"},{"family":"Yoda","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Lennerz","given":"Jochen K."},{"family":"Langenbucher","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jessica J."},{"family":"Rooney","given":"Marguerite"},{"family":"Prutisto-Chang","given":"Kylie"},{"family":"Oh","given":"Audris"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Nathaniel A."},{"family":"Yeap","given":"Beow Y."},{"family":"Chin","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Do","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Marble","given":"Hetal D."},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Digumarthy","given":"Subba R."},{"family":"Saxena","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Nagy","given":"Rebecca J."},{"family":"Benes","given":"Cyril H."},{"family":"Azzoli","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Lawrence","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Gainor","given":"Justin F."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."},{"family":"Hata","given":"Aaron N."}],"citation-key":"dagogo-jack_met_2020","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

  {"id":"dagogo-jack_treatment_2019","abstract":"Purpose: Acquired resistance to next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is often driven by secondary ALK mutations. Here, we investigated utility of plasma genotyping for identifying ALK resistance mutations at relapse on next-generation ALK TKIs. Experimental Design: We analyzed 106 plasma specimens from 84 patients with advanced ALK-positive lung cancer treated with second- and third-generation ALK TKIs using a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform (Guardant360). Tumor biopsies from TKI-resistant lesions underwent targeted NGS to identify ALK mutations. Results: By genotyping plasma, we detected an ALK mutation in 46 (66%) of 70 patients relapsing on a second-generation ALK TKI. When post-alectinib plasma and tumor specimens were compared, there was no difference in frequency of ALK mutations (67% vs. 63%), but plasma specimens were more likely to harbor ÔøΩÔøΩ2 ALK mutations (24% vs. 2%, P = 0.004). Among 29 patients relapsing on lorlatinib, plasma genotyping detected an ALK mutation in 22 (76%), including 14 (48%) with ÔøΩÔøΩ2 ALK mutations. The most frequent combinations of ALK mutations were G1202R/L1196M and D1203N/1171N. Detection of ÔøΩÔøΩ2 ALK mutations was significantly more common in patients relapsing on lorlatinib compared with second-generation ALK TKIs (48% vs. 23%, P = 0.017). Among 15 patients who received lorlatinib after a second-generation TKI, serial plasma analysis demonstrated that eight (53%) acquired ÔøΩÔøΩ1 new ALK mutations on lorlatinib. Conclusions: ALK resistance mutations increase with each successive generation of ALK TKI and may be underestimated by tumor genotyping. Sequential treatment with increasingly potent ALK TKIs may promote acquisition of ALK resistance mutations leading to treatment-refractory compound ALK mutations.","author":[{"family":"Dagogo-Jack","given":"Ibiayi"},{"family":"Rooney","given":"Marguerite"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jessica J."},{"family":"Nagy","given":"Rebecca J."},{"family":"Yeap","given":"Beow Y."},{"family":"Hubbeling","given":"Harper"},{"family":"Chin","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Ackil","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Farago","given":"Anna F."},{"family":"Hata","given":"Aaron N."},{"family":"Lennerz","given":"Jochen K."},{"family":"Gainor","given":"Justin F."},{"family":"Lanman","given":"Richard B."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."}],"citation-key":"dagogo-jack_treatment_2019","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

  {"id":"dardaei_shp2_2018","abstract":"Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung tumors initially respond to small-molecule ALK inhibitors, but drug resistance often develops. Of tumors that develop resistance to highly potent second-generation ALK inhibitors, approximately half harbor resistance mutations in ALK, while the other half have other mechanisms underlying resistance. Members of the latter group often have activation of at least one of several different tyrosine kinases driving resistance. Such tumors are not expected to respond to lorlatinib-a third-generation inhibitor targeting ALK that is able to overcome all clinically identified resistant mutations in ALK-and further therapeutic options are limited. Herein, we deployed a shRNA screen of 1,000 genes in multiple ALK-inhibitor-resistant patient-derived cells (PDCs) to discover those that confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition. This approach identified SHP2, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a common targetable resistance node in multiple PDCs. SHP2 provides a parallel survival input downstream of multiple tyrosine kinases that promote resistance to ALK inhibitors. Treatment with SHP099, the recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor of SHP2, in combination with the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) ceritinib halted the growth of resistant PDCs through preventing compensatory RAS and ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) reactivation. These findings suggest that combined ALK and SHP2 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for resistant cancers driven by several different ALK-independent mechanisms underlying resistance.","author":[{"family":"Dardaei","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hui Qin"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Manrose"},{"family":"Fordjour","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Katherine X"},{"family":"Yoda","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Kerr","given":"Grainne"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Kristine"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jinsheng"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Yichen"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Lawrence","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Langenbucher","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Gainor","given":"Justin F."},{"family":"Friboulet","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Dagogo-Jack","given":"Ibiayi"},{"family":"Myers","given":"David T."},{"family":"Labrot","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Ruddy","given":"David A."},{"family":"Parks","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Dana"},{"family":"DiCecca","given":"Richard H."},{"family":"Moody","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Huaixiang"},{"family":"Mohseni","given":"Morvarid"},{"family":"LaMarche","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Juliet"},{"family":"Hoffmaster","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Caponigro","given":"Giordano"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."},{"family":"Hata","given":"Aaron N."},{"family":"Benes","given":"Cyril H."},{"family":"Li","given":"Fang"},{"family":"Engelman","given":"Jeffrey A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"dardaei_shp2_2018","container-title":"Nature medicine","container-title-short":"Nat.

However, TF-MPs have yet to be accepted as a bona fide biomarker for cancer-associated VTE, as the presence of elevated TF-MPs levels is not always accompanied by thrombosis; interestingly in certain cases, particularly in pancreatic cancer, VTE seems to be more likely in the context of acute inflammation. While several potential mechanisms for the development of VTE in cancer have been postulated, this review explores the homeostatic disruption of TFMPs, as the main reservoir of blood-borne TF, in the context of cancer and inflammation, and considers the abrogated responses of the activated endothelium and mononuclear phagocyte system in mediating this disruption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Date","given":"K."},{"family":"Ettelaie","given":"C."},{"family":"Maraveyas","given":"A."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"date_tissue_2017","container-title":"Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis","container-title-short":"Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis","DOI":"10.1111/jth.13871","ISSN":"15387836","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"language":"en","page":"2289-2299","source":"16.036","title":"Tissue factor‚Äêbearing microparticles and inflammation: a potential mechanism for the development of venous thromboembolism in cancer","title-short":"Tissue factor‚Äêbearing microparticles and inflammation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1538783622044221","volume":"15"},

Here, we present the 13-year follow up of our study. Fifty-four patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled: 39 (72%) with de novo disease, 6 (11%) whose disease was primary refractory after induction (without a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and 9 (17%) in complete remission after one course of induction therapy (without tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Forty-two (93%) of the 45 patients treated for active disease achieved complete remission, one achieved complete remission with incomplete recovery of platelets, one achieved partial remission and one died during induction. Nineteen (35%) patients are alive and 18 are in complete remission. The 5-year overall survival rate for all patients was 43%. Significant negative predictors of overall survival were age over 60 years, p190 molecular transcript, and active disease at enrollment. Sixteen (30%) patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Median overall survival was not significantly greater for patients who underwent transplant. Patients with residual molecular disease at three months had improved complete remission duration with transplant. The median time to hematologic recovery and severe toxicities with combination were not significantly different from those observed with conventional chemotherapy. Only one patient discontinued therapy due to toxicity. HyperCVAD chemotherapy and imatinib is an effective regimen for Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

  {"id":"de_allogeneic_2017","abstract":"An international expert panel, active within the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, European LeukemiaNet, Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trial Group, and the International Myelodysplastic Syndromes Foundation developed recommendations for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Disease risks scored according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) and presence of comorbidity graded according to the HCT Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) were recognized as relevant clinical variables for HSCT eligibility. Fit patients with higher-risk IPSS-R and those with lower-risk IPSS-R with poor-risk genetic features, profound cytopenias, and high transfusion burden are candidates for HSCT. Patients with a very high MDS transplantation risk score, based on combination of advanced age, high HCT-CI, very poor-risk cytogenetic and molecular features, and high IPSS-R score have a low chance of cure with standard HSCT and consideration should be given to treating these patients in investigational studies. Cytoreductive therapy prior to HSCT is advised for patients with ‚â•10% bone marrow myeloblasts. Evidence from prospective randomized clinical trials does not provide support for specific recommendations on the optimal high intensity conditioning regimen. For patients with contraindications to high-intensity preparative regimens, reduced intensity conditioning should be considered. Optimal timing of HSCT requires careful evaluation of the available effective nontransplant strategies. Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) strategies are recommended in patients at high risk of relapse after HSCT. Immune modulation by DLI strategies or second HSCT is advised if relapse occurs beyond 6 months after HSCT.","author":[{"family":"de","given":"Witte Theo"},{"family":"Bowen","given":"David G."},{"family":"Robin","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Malcovati","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Niederwieser","given":"Dietger"},{"family":"Yakoub-Agha","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"Mufti","given":"Ghulam J."},{"family":"Fenaux","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Sanz","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Martino","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Alessandrino","given":"Emilio Paolo"},{"family":"Onida","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Symeonidis","given":"Argiris"},{"family":"Passweg","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Kobbe","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Ganser","given":"Arnold"},{"family":"Platzbecker","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Finke","given":"J√ºrgen"},{"family":"van","given":"Gelder Michel"},{"family":"van","given":"de Loosdrecht Arjan A."},{"family":"Ljungman","given":"Per"},{"family":"Stauder","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Volin","given":"Liisa"},{"family":"Deeg","given":"H.

  {"id":"de_impact_2019","abstract":"Progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) treated with red blood cell transfusions is usually reduced, but it is unclear whether transfusion dose density is an independent prognostic factor. The European MDS Registry collects prospective data at 6-monthly intervals from newly diagnosed lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes patients in 16 European countries and Israel. Data on the transfusion dose density - the cumulative dose received at the end of each interval divided by the time since the beginning of the interval in which the first transfusion was received - were analyzed using proportional hazards regression with time-varying co-variates, with death and progression to higher-risk MDS/acute myeloid leukemia as events. Of the 1,267 patients included in the analyses, 317 died without progression; in 162 patients the disease had progressed. PFS was significantly associated with age, EQ-5D index, baseline World Health Organization classification, bone marrow blast count, cytogenetic risk category, number of cytopenias, and country. Transfusion dose density was inversely associated with PFS (P<1√ó10-4): dose density had an increasing effect on hazard until a dose density of 3 units/16 weeks. The transfusion dose density effect continued to increase beyond 8 units/16 weeks after correction for the impact of treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, lenalidomide and/or iron chelators. In conclusion, the negative effect of transfusion treatment on PFS already occurs at transfusion densities below 3 units/16 weeks. This indicates that transfusion dependency, even at relatively low dose densities, may be considered as an indicator of inferior PFS.

In triple-negative breast cancer, the combination of cancer immunotherapy based on PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy was effective both in advanced and early setting phase 3 clinical trials. These encouraging results lead to the first approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer and thus offer new therapeutic possibilities in aggressive tumors and hard-to-treat populations. Furthermore, several ongoing trials are investigating combining immunotherapies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors with conventional therapies and as well as with other immunotherapeutic strategies such as cancer vaccines, CAR-T cells, bispecific antibodies, and oncolytic viruses in all breast cancer subtypes. This review provides an overview of immunotherapies currently under clinical development and updated key results from clinical trials.

Here this therapeutic modality is reviewed and critically evaluated in the context of the evidence. Specific criteria were used for searching the published literature and for grading the quality and strength of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. A panel of MDS experts comprising transplantation and nontransplantation physicians developed consensus treatment recommendations. This review summarizes the standard MDS indications for HCT and addresses areas of controversy. Recent prospective trials have confirmed that allogeneic HCT confers survival benefits in patients with advanced or high-risk MDS compared with nontransplantation approaches, and the use of HCT is increasing in older patients with good performance status. However, patients with high-risk cytogenetic or molecular mutations remain at high risk for relapse. It is unknown whether administration of novel therapies before or after transplantation may decrease the risk of disease relapse in selected populations. Ongoing and future studies will investigate revised approaches to disease risk stratification, patient selection, and post-transplantation approaches to optimize allogeneic HCT outcomes for patients with MDS.","author":[{"family":"DeFilipp","given":"Zachariah"},{"family":"Ciurea","given":"Stefan O"},{"family":"Cutler","given":"Corey"},{"family":"Robin","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Warlick","given":"Erica D"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Ryotaro"},{"family":"Brunner","given":"Andrew M"},{"family":"Dholaria","given":"Bhagirathbhai"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Alison R"},{"family":"Kr√∂ger","given":"Nicolaus"},{"family":"Bejanyan","given":"Nelli"},{"family":"Atallah","given":"Ehab"},{"family":"Tamari","given":"Roni"},{"family":"Solh","given":"Melhem M"},{"family":"Percival","given":"Mary-Elizabeth"},{"family":"de","given":"Lima Marcos"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Bart"},{"family":"Oran","given":"Betul"},{"family":"Garcia-Manero","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Hamadani","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Carpenter","given":"Paul"},{"family":"DeZern","given":"Amy E"}],"citation-key":"defilipp_hematopoietic_2022","container-title":"Transplantation and cellular therapy","container-title-short":"Transplant.

  {"id":"deforceville_radiotherapy_2019","abstract":"Abstract   Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable malignancy involving lymph nodes and the lymphatic system. Even at late stage disease, about 70% of patients will be cured with standard first line therapy. For patients who experience relapse or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the standard treatment option is high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplant. However about 50% of patients will have recurrence after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation and have worse prognosis with median overall survival of 32% at 5 years. The anti-PD1 checkpoints inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab have remarkably improved outcomes of patients with relapse of refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation. On the other hand, radiotherapy is an entire component of salvage therapy and its efficacy is now well established in term of local disease control in sites of relapsed or refractory Hodkin lymphoma. Defining the optimal modality and timing of radiotherapy as these new agents arrive is a challenge. An interesting approach is the combination of radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor and the possibility of stopping the treatment when complete response is achieved. We add to the literature two new cases of combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy in patients who relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation and consolidation with brentuximab vedotin, resulting in excellent outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Forceville","given":"L.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Deau-Fischer","given":"B."},{"family":"Deau-Fischer","given":"B√©n√©dicte"},{"family":"Patricia","given":"Franchi"},{"family":"Franchi","given":"P."},{"family":"Arsene-Henry","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Mounat","given":"T.

This phase III study investigated the effect of combining oxaliplatin with LV5FU2, with progression-free survival as the primary end point.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred twenty previously untreated patients with measurable disease were randomized to receive a 2-hour infusion of LV (200 mg/m(2)/d) followed by a 5FU bolus (400 mg/m(2)/d) and 22-hour infusion (600 mg/m(2)/d) for 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks, either alone or together with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour infusion on day 1.\nRESULTS: Patients allocated to oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2 had significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 9.0 v 6.2 months; P =.0003) and better response rate (50.7% v 22.3%; P =.0001) when compared with the control arm. The improvement in overall survival did not reach significance (median, 16.2 v 14.7 months; P =. 12). LV5FU2 plus oxaliplatin gave higher frequencies of National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia (41. 7% v 5.3% of patients), grade 3/4 diarrhea (11.9% v 5.3%), and grade 3 neurosensory toxicity (18.2% v 0%), but this did not result in impairment of quality of life (QoL). Survival without disease progression or deterioration in global health status was longer in patients allocated to oxaliplatin treatment (P =.004).\nCONCLUSION: The LV5FU2-oxaliplatin combination seems beneficial as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer, demonstrating a prolonged progression-free survival with acceptable tolerability and maintenance of QoL.","archive_location":"world","author":[{"family":"Gramont","given":"A.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Figer","given":"A."},{"family":"Seymour","given":"M."},{"family":"Homerin","given":"M."},{"family":"Hmissi","given":"A."},{"family":"Cassidy","given":"J."},{"family":"Boni","given":"C."},{"family":"Cortes-Funes","given":"H."},{"family":"Cervantes","given":"A."},{"family":"Freyer","given":"G."},{"family":"Papamichael","given":"D."},{"family":"Le Bail","given":"N."},{"family":"Louvet","given":"C."},{"family":"Hendler","given":"D."},{"family":"Braud","given":"F.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"C."},{"family":"Morvan","given":"F."},{"family":"Bonetti","given":"A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"degramont_leucovorin_2016","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2000.18.16.2938","ISSN":"0732-183X","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,21]]},"language":"eng","license":"¬© 2000 by American Society of Clinical Oncology","page":"2938-2947","publisher":"American Society of Clinical Oncology","source":"PubMed","title":"Leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin as first-line treatment in advanced colorectal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/JCO.2000.18.16.2938?role=tab","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"delahaye_early_2022","abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are effective therapies for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring EGFR-activating mutations, but are not curative due to the inevitable emergence of resistances. Recent in vitro studies suggest that resistance to EGFR-TKI may arise from a small population of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTP) through non-genetic reprogramming, by entering a reversible slow-to-non-proliferative state, before developing genetically derived resistances. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms governing the dynamics of the drug-tolerant state is therefore a priority to provide sustainable therapeutic solutions for patients. An increasing number of molecular mechanisms underlying DTP survival are being described, such as chromatin and epigenetic remodelling, the reactivation of anti-apoptotic/survival pathways, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with their micro-environment. Here, we review and discuss the existing proposed mechanisms involved in the DTP state.

Irinotecan has a highly complex metabolism, including hydrolyzation by carboxylesterases to its active metabolite SN-38, which is 100- to 1000-fold more active compared with irinotecan itself. Several phase I and II enzymes, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A, are involved in the formation of inactive metabolites, making its metabolism prone to environmental and genetic influences. Genetic variants in the DNA of these enzymes and transporters could predict a part of the drug-related toxicity and efficacy of treatment, which has been shown in retrospective and prospective trials and meta-analyses. Patient characteristics, lifestyle and comedication also influence irinotecan pharmacokinetics. Other factors, including dietary restriction, are currently being studied.

We evaluated whether this shift resulted in improved outcomes in routine clinical practice. We performed a cohort study of consecutive patients with cancer-associated VTE during 2001 and 2010. We compared the risks for recurrent VTE, major bleeding and mortality between patients diagnosed before and after 2008 during a 6-month routine follow-up. A total of 381 patients were included, of which 234 (61.4%) were diagnosed before 2008. Before 2008, 23% of the patients were treated with LMWH; thereafter, this percentage was higher: 67%. The 6-month incidence for recurrent VTE was 8.6% in patients diagnosed before 2008 versus 7.5% for patients diagnosed after 2008 (risk difference [RD]: ‚àí1.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ‚àí6.3, 5.3).

  {"id":"denis_willebrand_2021","abstract":"von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by its heterogeneous clinical manifestation, which complicates its diagnosis and management. The clinical management of VWD has remained essentially unchanged over the last 30 years or so, using von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentrates, desmopressin, and anti‚Äìfibrinolytic agents as main tools to control bleeding. This is in contrast to hemophilia A, for which a continuous innovative path has led to novel treatment modalities. Despite current VWD management being considered effective, quality-of-life studies consistently reveal a higher than anticipated burden of VWD on patients, which is particularly true for women. Apparently, despite our perceived notion of current therapeutic efficiency, there is space for innovation with the goal of reaching superior efficacy. Developing innovative treatments for VWD is complex, especially given the heterogeneity of the disease and the multifunctional nature of VWF. In this perspective article, we describe several potential strategies that could provide the basis for future VWD treatments. These include genetic approaches, such as gene therapy using dual-vector adenoassociated virus and transcriptional silencing of mutant alleles. Furthermore, protein-based approaches to increase factor FVIII levels in VWD-type 3 or 2N patients are discussed. Finally, antibody-based options to interfere with VWF degradation (for congenital VWD-type 2A or acquired von Willebrand syndrome-type 2A) or increase endogenous VWF levels (for VWD-type 1) are presented. By highlighting these potential strategies, we hope to initiate an innovative path, which ultimately would allow us to better serve VWD patients and their specific needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Denis","given":"C√©cile V."},{"family":"Susen","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Lenting","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"denis_willebrand_2021","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2020008501","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,29]]},"language":"en","page":"2299-2306","source":"Silverchair","title":"von willebrand disease: what does the future hold?","title-short":"von Willebrand disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2020008501","volume":"137"},

A Study of Eltrombopag in Myelodysplastic Syndromes Receiving Azacitidine (SUPPORT), a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, investigated the platelet supportive effects of eltrombopag given concomitantly with azacitidine. International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-risk MDS patients with baseline platelets <75 √ó 109/L were randomized 1:1 to eltrombopag (start, 200 mg/d [East Asians, 100 mg/d], maximum, 300 mg/d [East Asians, 150 mg/d]) or placebo, plus azacitidine (75 mg/m2 subcutaneously once daily for 7 days every 28 days). The primary end point was the proportion of patients platelet transfusion-free during cycles 1 through 4 of azacitidine therapy. Based on planned interim analyses, an independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping the study prematurely because efficacy outcomes crossed the predefined futility threshold and for safety reasons. At termination, 28/179 (16%) eltrombopag and 55/177 (31%) placebo patients met the primary end point. Overall response (International Working Group criteria; complete, marrow, or partial response) occurred in 20% and 35% of eltrombopag and placebo patients, respectively, by investigator assessment. There was no difference in hematologic improvement in any cell lineage between the 2 arms. There was no improvement in overall or progression-free survival. Adverse events with ‚â•10% occurrence in the eltrombopag vs placebo arm were febrile neutropenia and diarrhea. Compared with azacitidine alone, eltrombopag plus azacitidine worsened platelet recovery, with lower response rates and a trend toward increased progression to acute myeloid leukemia.

  {"id":"didik_prevalence_2020","abstract":"Background Under the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement is required to be assessed. However, data showing the prevalence of the ALK rearrangement is still deficient and is not yet available in Indonesia. This study used direct smear preparation from transthoracic needle specimens that are minimally invasive. The main objective of the study is to identify the prevalence of the ALK fusion rearrangement gene in cytological specimens. Materials and methods A total of 35 direct smear preparations diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutation negative were involved in this study. The samples were taken between 2017 and 2019. These samples were examined for EML4-ALK fusion rearrangement gene using qRT-PCR. The EML4-ALK rearrangement status was determined by qRT-PCR with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Results A total of 28 (80%) samples were from males, and 7 samples were from females. Seven (20% 95% CI: 8.4%-36.9%) samples were EML4-ALK rearrangement positive. The average age of the patients was 63.5 years old. The most common sites of metastasis in this study were pleural cavity, bone, liver, and CNS. Conclusions qRT-PCR successfully identified EML4-ALK fusion rearrangement in direct smear preparations of lung adenocarcinoma. Direct smear samples can be used for EML4-ALK rearrangement detection using qRT-PCR. The EML4-ALK rearrangement gene has high prevalence in selected lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutation-negative populations. ALK inhibitors in lung cancer can be openly considered for use in Indonesian patients to improve the outcome of this subset of patients.","author":[{"family":"Didik","given":"Setyo"},{"family":"Trisnawati","given":"Ika"},{"family":"Kumara","given":"Evan G"},{"family":"Laiman","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Yuliani","given":"Fara Silvia"},{"family":"Sumpono","given":"Auliya Suluk Brilliant"},{"family":"Cempaka","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Marcellus","given":"NA"},{"family":"Budiono","given":"Eko Heriyanto"}],"citation-key":"didik_prevalence_2020","container-title":"Pulmonary medicine","container-title-short":"Pulm.

  {"id":"ding_somatic_2008","abstract":"Determining the genetic basis of cancer requires comprehensive analyses of large collections of histopathologically well-classified primary tumours. Here we report the results of a collaborative study to discover somatic mutations in 188 human lung adenocarcinomas. DNA sequencing of 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more than 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples. Our analysis identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis. The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases, among them the EGFR homologue ERBB4; multiple ephrin receptor genes, notably EPHA3; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR; and NTRK genes. These data provide evidence of somatic mutations in primary lung adenocarcinoma for several tumour suppressor genes involved in other cancers--including NF1, APC, RB1 and ATM--and for sequence changes in PTPRD as well as the frequently deleted gene LRP1B. The observed mutational profiles correlate with clinical features, smoking status and DNA repair defects. These results are reinforced by data integration including single nucleotide polymorphism array and gene expression array. Our findings shed further light on several important signalling pathways involved in lung adenocarcinoma, and suggest new molecular targets for treatment.","author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Li"},{"family":"Getz","given":"Gad"},{"family":"Wheeler","given":"David A."},{"family":"Mardis","given":"Elaine R."},{"family":"McLellan","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Cibulskis","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Sougnez","given":"Carrie"},{"family":"Greulich","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Muzny","given":"Donna M."},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Fulton","given":"Lucinda"},{"family":"Fulton","given":"Robert S."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qunyuan"},{"family":"Wendl","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Lawrence","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Larson","given":"David E."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Dooling","given":"David J."},{"family":"Sabo","given":"Aniko"},{"family":"Hawes","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Jhangiani","given":"Shalini N."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Lora"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Otis"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yiming"},{"family":"Mathew","given":"Tittu"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Yanru"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Jiqiang"},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Clerc","given":"Kerstin"},{"family":"Metcalf","given":"Ginger A."},{"family":"Ng","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Milosavljevic","given":"Aleksandar"},{"family":"Gonzalez-Garay","given":"Manuel L."},{"family":"Osborne","given":"John R."},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Xiaoqi"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Yuzhu"},{"family":"Koboldt","given":"Daniel C."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Abbott","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Miner","given":"Tracie L."},{"family":"Pohl","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Fewell","given":"Ginger A."},{"family":"Haipek","given":"Carrie A."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Dunford-Shore","given":"Brian H."},{"family":"Kraja","given":"Aldi T."},{"family":"Crosby","given":"Seth D."},{"family":"Sawyer","given":"Christopher S."},{"family":"Vickery","given":"Tammi L."},{"family":"Sander","given":"Sacha N."},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Jody S."},{"family":"Winckler","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Baldwin","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Chirieac","given":"Lucian R."},{"family":"Dutt","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Fennell","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Hanna","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Bruce E."},{"family":"Onofrio","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Roman K."},{"family":"Tonon","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Weir","given":"Barbara A."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xiaojun"},{"family":"Ziaugra","given":"Liuda"},{"family":"Zody","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Giordano","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Orringer","given":"Mark B."},{"family":"Roth","given":"Jack A."},{"family":"Spitz","given":"Margaret R."},{"family":"Wistuba","given":"Ignacio I."},{"family":"Ozenberger","given":"Bradley A."},{"family":"Good","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Chang","given":"Andrew C."},{"family":"Beer","given":"David G."},{"family":"Watson","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Ladanyi","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Broderick","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Yoshizawa","given":"Akihiko"},{"family":"Travis","given":"William D."},{"family":"Pao","given":"William"},{"family":"Province","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Weinstock","given":"George M."},{"family":"Varmus","given":"Harold E."},{"family":"Gabriel","given":"Stacey"},{"family":"Lander","given":"Eric S."},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Meyerson","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Richard K."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"ding_somatic_2008","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature07423","issue":"7216","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"1069-1075","source":"64.8","title":"Somatic mutations affect key pathways in lung adenocarcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"455"},

Nonetheless, the availability of patient-derived CRC models coupled with in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and functional analyses over the past decade has finally led to advances in the field. Gene-specific alterations are not the only determinants that can successfully direct the use of targeted therapy. Indeed, successful inhibition of BRAF or KRAS in metastatic CRCs driven by activating mutations in these genes requires combinations of drugs that inhibit the mutant protein while at the same time restraining adaptive resistance via CRC-specific EGFR-mediated feedback loops. The emerging paradigm is, therefore, that the intrinsic biology of CRC cells must be considered alongside the molecular profiles of individual tumours in order to successfully personalize treatment. In this Review, we outline how preclinical studies based on patient-derived models have informed the design of practice-changing clinical trials. The integration of these experiences into a common framework will reshape the future design of biology-informed clinical trials in this field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Nicolantonio","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Vitiello","given":"Pietro Paolo"},{"family":"Marsoni","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Siena","given":"Salvatore"},{"family":"Tabernero","given":"Josep"},{"family":"Trusolino","given":"Livio"},{"family":"Bernards","given":"Rene"},{"family":"Bardelli","given":"Alberto"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"dinicolantonio_precision_2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1038/s41571-021-00495-z","ISSN":"1759-4782","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"8","page":"506-525","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"78.8","title":"Precision oncology in metastatic colorectal cancer ‚Äî from biology to medicine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-021-00495-z","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"dipalma_evaluating_2023","abstract":"Recent popularity surrounds large AI language models due to their impressive natural language capabilities. They contribute significantly to language-related tasks, including prompt-based learning, making them valuable for various specific tasks. This approach unlocks their full potential, enhancing precision and generalization. Research communities are actively exploring their applications, with ChatGPT receiving recognition. Despite extensive research on large language models, their potential in recommendation scenarios still needs to be explored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating ChatGPT's capabilities as a zero-shot recommender system. Our goals include evaluating its ability to use user preferences for recommendations, reordering existing recommendation lists, leveraging information from similar users, and handling cold-start situations. We assess ChatGPT's performance through comprehensive experiments using three datasets (MovieLens Small, Last.FM, and Facebook Book). We compare ChatGPT's performance against standard recommendation algorithms and other large language models, such as GPT-3.5 and PaLM-2.

  {"id":"dispenzieri_how_2012","abstract":"POEMS syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome whose acronym stands for less than half of the defining features of the disease, that is, polyradiculoneuropathy, organomegaly, potentially including coexisting Castleman disease, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell neoplasm, and skin changes. The other important features include papilledema, extravascular volume overload, sclerotic bone lesions, thrombocytosis, elevated VEGF, and abnormal pulmonary function. The diagnosis is based on having both the polyradiculoneuropathy and the monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and at least 1 of the other 3 major criteria (Castleman disease, sclerotic bone lesions, or elevated VEGF) and at least one minor criterion. The diagnosis is often delayed with intervening incorrect diagnoses of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, myeloproliferative disorder, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Prompt treatment directed at the underlying plasma cell clone produces dramatic responses in the majority of patients. Although there are no randomized clinical trial data to direct best therapy, for patients with disseminated disease, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood transplantation has yielded durable benefit, whereas radiation therapy is typically effective for patients with a more localized presentation. More universal recognition of and more scientific inquiry into the underpinnings of the disease will provide direction toward the best treatment strategies in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dispenzieri","given":"Angela"}],"citation-key":"dispenzieri_how_2012","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2012-03-378992","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,14]]},"language":"en","page":"5650-5658","source":"Silverchair","title":"How I treat POEMS syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2012-03-378992","volume":"119"},

CD includes unicentric CD (UCD) and multicentric CD (MCD), the latter of which is divided into idiopathic MCD (iMCD), human herpes virus-8 (HHV8)-associated MCD (HHV8-MCD), and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, skin changes (POEMS)-associated MCD (POEMS-MCD). iMCD can be further subclassified into iMCD‚Äìthrombocytopenia, ascites, reticulin fibrosis, renal dysfunction, organomegaly (iMCD-TAFRO) or iMCD‚Äìnot otherwise specified (iMCD-NOS). Advances in diagnosis, classification, pathogenesis, and therapy are substantial since the original description of UCD by Benjamin Castleman in 1954. The advent of effective retroviral therapy and use of rituximab in HHV8-MCD have improved outcomes in HHV8-MCD. Anti‚Äìinterleukin-6‚Äìdirected therapies are highly effective in many iMCD patients, but additional therapies are required for refractory cases. Much of the recent progress has been coordinated by the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN), and further progress will be made by continued engagement of physicians, scientists, and patients.

  {"id":"doebele_mechanisms_2012","abstract":"Purpose: Patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) gene rearrangements often manifest dramatic responses to crizotinib, a small-molecule ALK inhibitor. Unfortunately, not every patient responds and acquired drug resistance inevitably develops in those who do respond. This study aimed to define molecular mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib in patients with ALK + nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Experimental Design: We analyzed tissue obtained from 14 patients with ALK + NSCLC showing evidence of radiologic progression while on crizotinib to define mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance to crizotinib. Results: Eleven patients had material evaluable for molecular analysis. Four patients (36%) developed secondary mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK . A novel mutation in the ALK domain, encoding a G1269A amino acid substitution that confers resistance to crizotinib in vitro , was identified in two of these cases. Two patients, one with a resistance mutation, exhibited new onset ALK copy number gain (CNG). One patient showed outgrowth of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutant NSCLC without evidence of a persistent ALK gene rearrangement. Two patients exhibited a KRAS mutation, one of which occurred without evidence of a persisting ALK gene rearrangement. One patient showed the emergence of an ALK gene fusionÔøΩÂøõegative tumor compared with the baseline sample but with no identifiable alternate driver. Two patients retained ALK positivity with no identifiable resistance mechanism. Conclusions: Crizotinib resistance in ALK + NSCLC occurs through somatic kinase domain mutations, ALK gene fusion CNG, and emergence of separate oncogenic drivers.

  {"id":"domingo-domenech_treatment_2020","abstract":"Although autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) is the standard of care for patients with refractory/relapsed (R/R) classical Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (cHL), there is still a significant proportion of patients that relapse after the procedure. This review contemplates different treatment strategies for patients with cHL that relapse or progress after auto-HCT. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has, for many years, been the only curative option for this group of patients. Although the advent of haploidentical donors has allowed for the possibility to allograft almost all patients that are in need of it and to eventually improve historical results, allo-HCT is still associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an antibody drug conjugate that binds to CD30 antigen; BV is able to give up to 34% metabolic complete remissions (mCR) in HL patients that fail auto-HCT. Unleashing the immune system with PD-1 inhibitors has resulted in remarkable responses in a number of malignancies, including HL. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab offer a 20%‚Äì25% mCR and 40%‚Äì50% partial remissions, with an acceptable safety profile. R/R cHL do have several options nowadays that, without any doubt, have significantly improved the long-term outcome of this hard-to-treat population.","author":[{"family":"Domingo-Domenech","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Sureda","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Sureda","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"domingo-domenech_treatment_2020","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","container-title-short":"J.

The aim of this study was to decipher clinical and laboratory characteristics of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after definite diagnosis of liver failure and to provide clues for early diagnosis and treatment of HLH in patients with liver failure. Eleven patients diagnosed with liver failure and HLH were retrospectively investigated in this study. All patients presented with jaundice, persistent high-grade fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, evidence of hemophagocytes in the bone marrow and laboratory abnormalities indicating HLH. The average interval from the earliest diagnosis of liver failure to a definitive diagnosis of HLH was 17.27 days. Six (54.55%) patients died during follow-up. For patients with liver failure after admission and subsequently definitively diagnosed with HLH, bilirubin and INR were significantly decreased. HLH is definitely diagnosed at an intermediate or late stage when patients have already suffered from liver failure. The initial dose of glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone) was decreased to 1‚Äì1.5‚Äâmg/kg/d and gradually reduced thereafter. In conclusion, for patients with liver failure, HLH should be screened as early as possible upon persistent fever, splenomegaly and unexplained pancytopenia.

  {"id":"donnellan_cancer_2017","abstract":"Abstract\n            Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Patients with cancer are six times more likely to develop VTE than their noncancer counterparts, and VTE is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Despite the publication of major consensus guidelines setting out recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients, there remains a gulf between these guidelines and clinical practice. In general, thromboprophylaxis is recommended for most patients hospitalized with active cancer. Furthermore, outpatient thromboprophylaxis may be used in carefully selected high-risk ambulatory patients. Certain areas of controversy still remain. Although low-molecular-weight heparin has been shown to be superior to vitamin K antagonists in cancer patients, the role of direct oral anticoagulants is still uncertain. Moreover, recurrent thromboembolism, bleeding, and thrombocytopenia are frequently seen in cancer patients. Optimal anticoagulation in such instances presents a major challenge to clinicians. Modern computed tomography techniques have resulted in an increase in the detection of ‚Äúincidental‚Äù VTE. Despite a growing body of evidence promulgating standard anticoagulant treatment in such cases, these cases present further challenges for members of the multidisciplinary team.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Donnellan","given":"Eoin"},{"family":"Khorana","given":"Alok A."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"donnellan_cancer_2017","container-title":"The Oncologist","DOI":"10.1634/theoncologist.2016-0214","ISSN":"1083-7159, 1549-490X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"199-207","source":"5.837","title":"Cancer and Venous Thromboembolic Disease: A Review","title-short":"Cancer and Venous Thromboembolic Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article/22/2/199/6438570","volume":"22"},

This prespecified final descriptive analysis of efficacy and safety was planned for 30 months after the last patient was enrolled.\nRESULTS: A total of 1183 patients were randomized. Median PFS for WT KRAS mCRC was 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.3-11.4 months] for arm 1 and 8.6 months (95% CI 7.5-9.5 months) for arm 2; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.80; 95% CI 0.67-0.95; P = 0.01.

Infusion schedules were once weekly or every 2 weeks, and were chosen by each centre. We assessed response rates and time to progression, and also response duration, survival, and quality of life. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population and on evaluable patients.\nFINDINGS: The response rate was significantly higher in patients in the irinotecan group than in those in the no-irinotecan group (49 vs 31%, p<0.001 for evaluable patients, 35 vs 22%, p<0.005 by intention to treat).

A total of 639 patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutations in exon 2 had results for at least one of the following: KRAS exon 3 or 4; NRAS exon 2, 3, or 4; or BRAF exon 15. The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90%.\nRESULTS: Among 512 patients without RAS mutations, progression-free survival was 10.1 months with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 versus 7.9 months with FOLFOX4 alone (hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.90; P=0.004).

A total of 108 patients (17%) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations. These mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival and overall survival with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 treatment, which was consistent with the findings in patients with KRAS mutations in exon 2.

A recent review of our institutional policies and practices regarding RN-performed bone marrow procedures was intended to ensure that we were using a safe and evidence-based approach and prompted this program evaluation.\nMETHODS: We conducted a literature search and review of our institutional policies and practices regarding RN-performed bone marrow procedures. All elements of our clinical practice were reviewed and evaluated, including outcomes.\nRESULTS: Between 2010 and 2017, the RN team completed a total of 10,867 bone marrow procedures in our hospital-based ambulatory infusion center. The team included 15 nurses who completed up to eight patient procedures each weekday. Patient satisfaction rates were consistently high and complication rates were very low: less than 1% of all patients experienced postprocedure bleeding, and less than 2% required urgent medical care within 24 hours of the procedure. In an analysis of bone marrow procedures performed between 2016 and 2017, the quality of bone marrow samples obtained by the RN team remained high, consistently meeting or exceeding our 95% clinical adequacy goal.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence in the literature supporting the practice of RN-performed bone marrow procedures.

  {"id":"dreger_cellular_2020","abstract":"Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T (CART) cells are a promising new treatment option for patients with multiply relapsed and refractory (R/R) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Because of the favorable outcome data reported for CART cells, uncertainty is emerging if there is still a role for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in the treatment of R/R DLBCL. This article provides an overview of available evidence and theoretical considerations to put these 2 types of cellular immunotherapy (CI) into perspective. Altogether, current data suggest that CART cells are preferred now over transplantation as first-choice CI in many clinical situations. However, the majority of patients will fail CART therapy, resulting in an unmet medical need where allo-HCT could be beneficial. In contrast, employing allo-HCT instead of CART cells as first CI should be presently restricted to situations where CART cell therapy is deemed not feasible or useful, such as patients with refractory cytopenia or incipient myelodysplastic syndrome. However, allo-HCT remains a standard treatment option as first CI for patients with chemosensitive R/R DLBCL when CARTs are not available or transplantation is preferred by the patient. Continuous collection and analysis of CI outcome data by professional registries appear to be of key importance for developing rational strategies of CI allocation and sequencing.","author":[{"family":"Dreger","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Fenske","given":"Timothy S."},{"family":"Montoto","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Pasquini","given":"Marcelo C."},{"family":"Sureda","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Hamadani","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)","given":""}],"citation-key":"dreger_cellular_2020","container-title":"Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation: Journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","container-title-short":"Biol Blood Marrow Transplant","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.12.771","ISSN":"1523-6536","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"e77-e85","PMCID":"PMC7207150","PMID":"31917272","source":"PubMed","title":"Cellular Immunotherapy for Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma in the Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Engineered T Cell Era: Still a Role for Allogeneic Transplantation?","title-short":"Cellular Immunotherapy for Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma in the Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Engineered T Cell Era","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"driessen_how_2021","abstract":"Abstract Approximately 10% to 30% of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) develop relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease. Of those patients, 50% to 60% show long-term progression-free survival after standard salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). In the past decade, novel therapies have been developed, such as the CD30-directed antibody‚Äìdrug conjugate brentuximab vedotin and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have greatly extended the treatment possibilities for patients with R/R cHL. Several phase 1/2 clinical trials have shown promising results of these new drugs as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, but unfortunately, very few randomized phase 3 trials have been performed in this setting, making it difficult to give evidence-based recommendations for optimal treatment sequencing. Two important goals for the improvement in the treatment of R/R cHL can be identified: (1) increasing long-term progression-free and overall survival by optimizing risk-adapted treatment and (2) decreasing toxicity in patients with a low risk of relapse of disease by evaluating the need for HDCT/ASCT in these patients. In this review, we discuss treatment options for patients with R/R cHL in different settings: patients with a first relapse, primary refractory disease, and in patients who are ineligible or unfit for ASCT. Results of clinical trials investigating novel therapies or strategies published over the past 5 years are summarized.","author":[{"family":"Driessen","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Tonino","given":"Sanne H."},{"family":"Moskowitz","given":"Alison J."},{"family":"Kersten","given":"Marie Jos√©"}],"citation-key":"driessen_how_2021","DOI":"10.1182/hematology.2021000311","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,10]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4200134565","page":"240-246","PMID":"34889399","title":"How to choose first salvage therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma: traditional chemotherapy vs novel agents.","type":"article-journal","volume":"2021"},

Methods A global, multi-institutional registry (cohort A, n = 114) and a bi-institutional data set (cohort B, n = 71) of RET-rearranged lung cancer patients were analyzed. Patients were eligible if they had stage IV lung cancers harboring a RET rearrangement by local testing. The incidence of brain metastases and outcomes with multikinase inhibitor therapy were determined. Results The frequency of brain metastases at the time of diagnosis of stage IV disease was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18%ÔøΩÔøΩ32%) in all patients from both cohorts. The lifetime prevalence of brain metastasis in stage IV disease was 46% (95% CI: 34%ÔøΩÔøΩ58%) in patients for whom longitudinal data was available.

  {"id":"drilon_ros1dependent_2021","abstract":"The proto-oncogene ROS1 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase with an unknown physiological role in humans. Somatic chromosomal fusions involving ROS1 produce chimeric oncoproteins that drive a diverse range of cancers in adult and paediatric patients. ROS1-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are therapeutically active against these cancers, although only early-generation multikinase inhibitors have been granted regulatory approval, specifically for the treatment of ROS1 fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancers; histology-agnostic approvals have yet to be granted. Intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms of resistance to ROS1 TKIs can emerge in patients. Potential factors that influence resistance acquisition include the subcellular localization of the particular ROS1 oncoprotein and the TKI properties such as the preferential kinase conformation engaged and the spectrum of targets beyond ROS1. Importantly, the polyclonal nature of resistance remains underexplored. Higher-affinity next-generation ROS1 TKIs developed to have improved intracranial activity and to mitigate ROS1-intrinsic resistance mechanisms have demonstrated clinical efficacy in these regards, thus highlighting the utility of sequential ROS1 TKI therapy. Selective ROS1 inhibitors have yet to be developed, and thus the specific adverse effects of ROS1 inhibition cannot be deconvoluted from the toxicity profiles of the available multikinase inhibitors. Herein, we discuss the non-malignant and malignant biology of ROS1, the diagnostic challenges that ROS1 fusions present and the strategies to target ROS1 fusion proteins in both treatment-naive and acquired-resistance settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Drilon","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Chelsea"},{"family":"Iyer","given":"Sudarshan"},{"family":"Schoenfeld","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Keddy","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Davare","given":"Monika A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"drilon_ros1dependent_2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1038/s41571-020-0408-9","ISSN":"1759-4782","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 Springer Nature Limited","number":"1","page":"35-55","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"78.8","title":"ROS1-dependent cancers ‚Äî biology, diagnostics and therapeutics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-020-0408-9","volume":"18"},

After ‚â•35 months' follow-up (data cut-off: October 30, 2020), the objective response rate was 57.5% (n=46/80), including a complete response in 40.0% of patients (n=32/80) and a partial response in 17.5% of patients (n=14/80). The median duration of response was 43.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 26.1-not reached), the median overall survival was 33.5 months (95% CI: 18.3-not reached) and the median progression-free survival was 11.6 months (95% CI: 6.3-45.7). There were no unexpected toxicities. Subgroup analyses revealed consistent long-term efficacy results across most subgroups of patients. This extended follow-up of L-MIND confirms the long duration of response, meaningful overall survival, and well-defined safety profile of tafasitamab plus lenalidomide followed by tafasitamab monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation.

As the technology to produce these complex therapeutics has matured, many more ADCs have been approved or are in late-phase clinical trials. The diversification of antigenic targets as well as bioactive payloads is rapidly broadening the scope of tumour indications for ADCs. Moreover, novel vector protein formats as well as warheads targeting the tumour microenvironment are expected to improve the intratumour distribution or activation of ADCs, and consequently their anticancer activity for difficult-to-treat tumour types. However, toxicity remains a key issue in the development of these agents, and better understanding and management of ADC-related toxicities will be essential for further optimization.

Different strategies of cancer screening have been evaluated: they are often timeconsuming, cause stress and anxiety, and frequently require second-look examinations (due to the risk of false positives), with ultimately a very low yield (about 5%). We evaluated the number of suspect cancer tests before reporting them to the number of cancers finally diagnosed, after a VTE, in the setting of practice's analysis.\nMethods > We studied retrospectively patients hospitalized for a VTE and with a cancer screening, between 2011 and 2012. Screening cancer was defined by performing at least one of the following tests: PSA, fecal occult blood test, mammography, abdominopelvic iconography (abdominal ultrasound and/or abdominal CT scan). We recorded the suspected cancer tests, the cancers diagnosed, their stage and the survival. These results were expressed as a percentage with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults > Out of the 491 patients treated for a VTE, screening cancer was performed on 295 patients (median age 66.2 years). Nineteen PSA (16.7%, 95% CI [10.3‚Äì25]) were abnormal, with 2 localized prostate cancers. Nineteen fecal occult blood tests (15.3%, 95% CI [9.5‚Äì23]) were positive, with 2 local cancers.

Early identification of innate or acquired resistance mechanisms to these agents is essential to direct development of future therapies. We describe the detection of heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance within populations of EGFR mutant cells (PC9 and/or NCI-H1975) with acquired resistance to current and newly developed EGFR TKIs including AZD9291. We report the detection of NRAS mutations, including a novel E63K mutation, and a gain of copy number of WT NRAS or WT KRAS in cell populations resistant to gefitinib, afatinib, WZ4002 or AZD9291. Compared to parental cells, a number of resistant cell populations were more sensitive to inhibition by the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) when treated in combination with the originating EGFR inhibitor. In vitro, a combination of AZD9291 with selumetinib prevented emergence of resistance in PC9 cells and delayed resistance in NCI-H1975 cells. In vivo, concomitant dosing of AZD9291 with selumetinib caused regression of AZD9291-resistant tumours in an EGFRm/T790M transgenic model. Our data support the use of a combination of AZD9291 with a MEK inhibitor to delay or prevent resistance to AZD9291 in EGFRm and/or EGFRm/T790M tumours. Further, these findings suggest that NRAS modifications in tumour samples from patients who have progressed on current or EGFR inhibitors in development may support subsequent treatment with a combination of EGFR and MEK inhibition.","author":[{"family":"Eberlein","given":"Catherine Anne"},{"family":"Stetson","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Markovets","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Al-Kadhimi","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Lai","given":"Zhongwu"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Meador","given":"Catherine B."},{"family":"Spitzler","given":"Paula J."},{"family":"Ichihara","given":"Eiki"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Ahdesmaki","given":"Miika"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Ambar"},{"family":"Ratcliffe","given":"Laura E."},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Elizabeth L.

  {"id":"egan_patients_2014","abstract":"Abstract Despite the successes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in improving outcomes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PhÔøΩ+ ALL), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) continues to be an important and potentially curative option for selected patients with either disease. After HSCT, TKIs are increasingly being used to treat or prevent disease relapse, and practice patterns suggest that these TKIs are often chosen empirically without regard to pre-HSCT mutation status. We investigated whether ABL kinase domain mutations persist after transplantation and, thus, whether pre-HSCT mutation status should inform the selection of post-HSCT TKIs in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed adults who underwent allogeneic HSCT for CML and PhÔøΩ+ ALL at our institution between 2000 and 2010, and we identified subjects who had detectable BCR-ABL transcripts by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as available RNA for Sanger sequencing of the ABL kinase domain, in both the pre- and post-HSCT settings. In total, 95 CML and 20 PhÔøΩ+ ALL patients with positive PCR transcripts were identified, of which 10 (10.5%) and 4 (20.0%), respectively, were found to have pre-HSCT ABL kinase mutations known to confer TKI resistance. In 9 (64.2%) of these 14 patients, the same kinase mutation was also detectable at an average time of 191 days after HSCT. Seven (50.0%) of the 14 harboring mutations had relapsed/refractory disease by last follow-up, of which, in retrospect, 6 had received a predictably ineffective TKI within the first 100 days after transplantation based on our mutation analysis. These data support the idea that pre-existing mutations in the ABL kinase domain, frequently associated with resistance to TKIs and prevalent in a transplantation population, are persistently detectable in the majority of patients after transplantation. We propose that such resistance patterns should be considered when selecting TKIs in the post-HSCT setting, including clinical trials of post-HSCT TKI prophylaxis.","author":[{"family":"Egan","given":"Daniel N."},{"family":"Beppu","given":"Lan"},{"family":"Radich","given":"Jerald P."}],"citation-key":"egan_patients_2014","container-title":"Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","container-title-short":"Biol. blood marrow transplant. : j.

Radiographic imaging with CT scan is recommended in symptomatic patients, for example in pulmonary symptomatic patients, in order to exclude pulmonary infiltration or pleural effusion by CLL. MRI, chest radiography or abdominal ultrasound (US) may be considered as alternatives if there are contraindications against CT scan or a scan is not available. In general, CT scans of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis or MRI may be helpful to assess the tumour load and risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), particularly before treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. In addition, CT scans may be useful for baseline and final assessment in clinical trials,12Cheson B.D. Fisher R.I.

In daily life, important treatment end points in clinical trials, such as response rate, minimal residual disease (MRD) status or progression-free-survival (PFS), may be more relevant for young and/or fit patients than in older patients and/or patients with relevant comorbidity. Ultimately, in most patients, survival depends on the effect and choice of treatment sequences given along the course of the disease. ‚Ä¢Binet and Rai staging systems with clinical symptoms are relevant for treatment indication [III, A].‚Ä¢del(17p), TP53 mutations and IGHV status are relevant for choice of therapy and should be assessed before treatment [III, A].‚Ä¢Routine evaluation of del(17p), TP53 mutation and IGHV status in early and asymptomatic stage is not recommended [V, D].‚Ä¢Routine imaging during a watch-and-wait period is not recommended unless there are clinical symptoms [V, E].

The standard treatment of patients with early disease is a watch-and-wait strategy [I, A]. Blood cell counts and clinical examinations should be carried out every 3-12 months after the first year, when 3-monthly intervals should be applied for all patients. Due to the lack of clinical trials, no evidence-based treatment recommendation can be given for localised, early-stage SLL, but there is consensus that the management of SLL is similar to CLL. Locoregional radiotherapy may only be considered for symptomatic lymphadenopathy in selected patients with localised SLL. ‚Ä¢The standard treatment of patients with early asymptomatic disease is a watch-and-wait strategy [I, A].

Design, Setting, and Patients Prospective study conducted at 7 tertiary care centers in Europe and North America between January 2005 and October 2010 among 256 patients with SC assessed at the time of presentation as well as 1 to 6 months after the acute event. Main Outcome Measures Complete recovery of LV dysfunction.\nResults Eighty-one percent of patients (n=207) were postmenopausal women, 8% (n=20) were younger women (aged ’Ö50 years), and 11% (n=29) were men. A stressful trigger could be identified in 182 patients (71%). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging data (available for 239 patients [93%]) revealed 4 distinct patterns of regional ventricular ballooning: apical (n=197 [82%]), biventricular (n=81 [34%]), midventricular (n=40 [17%]), and basal (n=2 [1%]). Left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced (48% [SD, 11%]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 47%-50%) in all patients. Stress cardiomyopathy was accurately identified by CMR using specific criteria: a typical pattern of LV dysfunction, myocardial edema, absence of significant necrosis/fibrosis, and markers for myocardial inflammation. Follow-up CMR imaging showed complete normalization of LV ejection fraction (66% [SD, 7%]; 95% CI, 64%68%) and inflammatory markers in the absence of significant fibrosis in all patients.\nConclusions The clinical profile of SC is considerably broader than reported previously.

Due to higher systemic and intracranial efficacy, the second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) alectinib and brigatinib have irrevocably displaced crizotinib as standard first-line treatment, based on the results of the ALEX and ALTA-1L trials. Besides, lorlatinib and brigatinib are the preferred second-line therapies for progression under second-generation TKI and crizotinib, respectively, based on the results of several phase II studies. Tissue or liquid rebiopsies at the time of disease progression, even though not mandated by the approval status of any ALK inhibitor, are gaining importance for individualization and optimization of patient management. Of particular interest are cases with off-target resistance, for example MET, HER2 or KRAS alterations, which require special therapeutic maneuvers, e.g., inclusion in early clinical trials or off-label administration of respectively targeted drugs. On the other hand, up to approximately half of the patients failing TKI, develop anatomically restricted progression, which can be initially tackled with local ablative measures without switch of systemic therapy. Among the overall biologically favorable ALK+ tumors, with a mean tumor mutational burden uniquely below 3 mutations per Mb and the longest survival among NSCLC currently, presence of the EML4-ALK fusion variant 3 and/or TP53 mutations identify high-risk cases with earlier treatment failure and a need for more aggressive surveillance and treatment strategies. The potential clinical utility of longitudinal ctDNA assays for earlier detection of disease progression and improved guidance of therapy in these patients is a currently a matter of intense investigation. Major pharmaceutical challenges for the field are the development of more potent, fourth-generation TKI and effective immuno-oncological interventions, especially ALK-directed cell therapies, which will be essential for further improving survival and achieving cure of ALK+ tumors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Elsayed","given":"Mei"},{"family":"Christopoulos","given":"Petros"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"elsayed_therapeutic_2021","container-title":"Pharmaceuticals","DOI":"10.3390/ph14020080","ISSN":"1424-8247","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"80","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"4.6","title":"Therapeutic Sequencing in ALK+ NSCLC","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/14/2/80","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"ercan_egfr_2015","abstract":"Purpose: Mutant selective irreversible pyrimidine-based EGFR kinase inhibitors, including WZ4002, CO-1686, and AZD9291, are effective in preclinical models and in lung cancer patients harboring the EGFR T790M gefitinib/erlotinib resistance mutation. However, little is known about how cancers develop acquired resistance to this class of EGFR inhibitors. We sought to identify and study EGFR mutations that confer resistance to this class of agents. Experimental Design: We performed an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in EGFR -mutant (sensitizing alone or with concurrent EGFR T790M) Ba/F3 cells and selected drug-resistant clones. We evaluated the sensitivity of EGFR inhibitors in models harboring drug-resistant EGFR mutations. Results: We identified 3 major drug resistance mutations. EGFR L718Q, L844V, and C797S cause resistance to both WZ4002 and CO-1686 while, in contrast, only EGFR C797S leads to AZD9291 resistance. Cells containing an EGFR -sensitizing mutation, Del 19 or L858R, in conjunction with L718Q, L844V, or C797S retain sensitivity to quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib and afatinib. The C797S mutation, in the presence of Del 19 or L858R and T790M, causes resistance to all current EGFR inhibitors, but L858R/T790M/C797S remains partially sensitive to cetuximab which leads to disruption of EGFR dimerization. Conclusions: Our findings provide insights into resistance mechanisms to irreversible pyrimidine-based EGFR inhibitors and identify specific genomic contexts in which sensitivity is retained to existing clinical EGFR inhibitors.

The irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor WZ4002 is effective against the most common mechanism of drug resistance mediated by the EGFR T790M mutation. Here, we show, in multiple complementary models, that resistance to WZ4002 develops through aberrant activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling caused by either an amplification of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) or by downregulation of negative regulators of ERK signaling. Inhibition of MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) or ERK restores sensitivity to WZ4002 and prevents the emergence of drug resistance. We further identify MAPK1 amplification in an erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung carcinoma patient. In addition, the WZ4002-resistant MAPK1-amplified cells also show an increase both in EGFR internalization and a decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

  {"id":"essmann_iron_2022","abstract":"During conditioning chemotherapy prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), non-transferrin-bound iron and its chelatable form, labile plasma iron (LPI), regularly appear in the blood of patients at high levels of transferrin saturation (TfS). As these free iron species potentially favor infection and mediate transplantation-associated toxicities, chelation therapy could be an approach to improve outcome after transplantation. However, data addressing iron chelation in the immediate peritransplantation period are sparse. In this study, we investigated the influence of iron chelation with deferasirox during conditioning chemotherapy on the appearance of LPI, the incidence of infection and toxicities, and the tolerability of this treatment in the peritransplantation period. We conducted this single-center prospective observational study in 25 adults with iron overload (serum ferritin >1000 ¬µg/L) undergoing allogeneic HSCT after myeloablative busulfan-based conditioning chemotherapy. Patients received iron chelation with deferasirox (14 mg/kg) from the start of conditioning until day 3 post-transplantation. Iron parameters, including LPI, were obtained at the chelator's trough level daily until day 0 and then on days 4, 7, and 14. Data on infection (bacteremia or invasive fungal disease) and toxicity, as well as the tolerability of deferasirox, were collected until the end of the follow-up period on day 28. Data were analyzed descriptively. TfS levels exceeded 70% in median on 6 days (range, 4 to 10¬†days) and in 63.6% (range, 36.4% to 90.9%) of the samples per patient, although in 19 of 25 patients (76%), no elevated LPI values were detected during the intake of deferasirox despite high TfS levels. Only 6 patients (24%) showed mildly increased LPI values (‚â§0.5¬†units) during the intake of deferasirox, 3 of whom had presented with elevated LPI values before the start of conditioning. Deferasirox was well tolerated, and no aggravation of toxicities was observed. Infection occurred in 5 patients (20%), including 3 of the 6 patients with elevated LPI values despite chelation therapy. In the present study, we demonstrate that iron chelation with deferasirox safely suppresses the appearance of LPI and might decrease the incidence of infection, whereas the impact on transplantation-associated toxicities remains to be elucidated.","author":[{"family":"Essmann","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Heestermans","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Dadkhah","given":"Adrin"},{"family":"Janson","given":"Dietlinde"},{"family":"Wolschke","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Ayuk","given":"Francis"},{"family":"Kr√∂ger","given":"Nicolaus M"},{"family":"Langebrake","given":"Claudia"}],"citation-key":"essmann_iron_2022","container-title":"Transplantation and cellular therapy","container-title-short":"Transplant.

  {"id":"estupinan_comparative_2021","abstract":"The cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase BTK plays an essential role for differentiation and survival of B-lineage cells and, hence, represents a suitable drug target. The number of BTK inhibitors (BTKis) in the clinic has increased considerably and currently amounts to at least 22. First-in-class was ibrutinib, an irreversible binder forming a covalent bond to a cysteine in the catalytic region of the kinase, for which we have identified 228 active trials listed at ClinicalTrials.gov. Next-generation inhibitors, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, are approved both in the United States and in Europe, and zanubrutinib also in China, while tirabrutinib is currently only registered in Japan. In most cases, these compounds have been used for the treatment of B-lymphocyte tumors. However, an increasing number of trials instead addresses autoimmunity and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus and systemic lupus erythematosus with the use of either irreversibly binding inhibitors, e.g., evobrutinib and tolebrutinib, or reversibly binding inhibitors, like fenebrutinib. Adverse effects (AEs) have predominantly implicated inhibition of other kinases with a BTKi-binding cysteine in their catalytic domain. Analysis of the reported AEs suggests that ibrutinib-associated atrial fibrillation is caused by binding to ERBB2/HER2 and ERBB4/HER4. However, the binding pattern of BTKis to various additional kinases does not correlate with the common assumption that skin manifestations and diarrhoeas are off-target effects related to EGF receptor inhibition. Moreover, dermatological toxicities, diarrhoea, bleedings and invasive fungal infections often develop early after BTKi treatment initiation and subsequently subside. Conversely, cardiovascular AEs, like hypertension and various forms of heart disease, often persist.","author":[{"family":"Estupi√±√°n","given":"H.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a recently approved companion in vitro diagnostic class FISH system commonly assesses ALK status. More accessible IHC is challenged by low expression of ALK-fusion transcripts in NSCLC. We compared ultrasensitive automated IHC with FISH for detecting ALK status on 318 FFPE and 40 matched ThinPrep specimens from 296 patients with advanced NSCLC. IHC was concordant with FFPE-FISH on 229 of 231 dual-informative samples (31 positive and 198 negative) and with ThinPrep-FISH on 34 of 34 samples (5 positive and 29 negative). Two cases with negative IHC and borderline-positive FFPE-FISH (15% and 18%, respectively) were reclassified as concordant based on negative matched ThinPrep-FISH and clinical data consistent with ALK-negative status. Overall, after including ThinPrep-FISH and amending the false-positive FFPE-FISH results, IHC demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.00 and 0.97 to 1.00, respectively) for ALK detection on 249 dual-informative NSCLC samples. IHC was informative on significantly more samples than FFPE-FISH, revealing additional ALK-positive cases. The high concordance with FISH warrants IHC's routine use as the initial component of an algorithmic approach to clinical ALK testing in NSCLC, followed by reflex FISH confirmation of IHC-positive cases.","author":[{"family":"Eugen","given":"C."},{"family":"Portier","given":"Bryce P."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Lanigan","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Farver","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Yan"},{"family":"C.","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Arrossi","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Pennell","given":"Nathan A."},{"family":"Tubbs","given":"Raymond R.

  {"id":"eysenbach_role_2023","abstract":"ChatGPT is a generative language model tool launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022, enabling the public to converse with a machine on a broad range of topics. In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application to date. This interview with ChatGPT is part 2 of a larger interview with ChatGPT. It provides a snapshot of the current capabilities of ChatGPT and illustrates the vast potential for medical education, research, and practice but also hints at current problems and limitations. In this conversation with Gunther Eysenbach, the founder and publisher of JMIR Publications, ChatGPT generated some ideas on how to use chatbots in medical education. It also illustrated its capabilities to generate a virtual patient simulation and quizzes for medical students; critiqued a simulated doctor-patient communication and attempts to summarize a research article (which turned out to be fabricated); commented on methods to detect machine-generated text to ensure academic integrity; generated a curriculum for health professionals to learn about artificial intelligence (AI); and helped to draft a call for papers for a new theme issue to be launched in JMIR Medical Education on ChatGPT. The conversation also highlighted the importance of proper \"prompting.\" Although the language generator does make occasional mistakes, it admits these when challenged. The well-known disturbing tendency of large language models to hallucinate became evident when ChatGPT fabricated references. The interview provides a glimpse into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT and the future of AI-supported medical education. Due to the impact of this new technology on medical education, JMIR Medical Education is launching a call for papers for a new e-collection and theme issue. The initial draft of the call for papers was entirely machine generated by ChatGPT, but will be edited by the human guest editors of the theme issue.","author":[{"family":"Eysenbach","given":"Gunther"}],"citation-key":"eysenbach_role_2023","container-title":"JMIR medical education","container-title-short":"JMIR Med Educ","DOI":"10.2196/46885","ISSN":"2369-3762","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"language":"en","page":"e46885","PMCID":"PMC10028514","PMID":"36863937","source":"PubMed","title":"The Role of ChatGPT, Generative Language Models, and Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education: A Conversation With ChatGPT and a Call for Papers","title-short":"The Role of ChatGPT, Generative Language Models, and Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"f_drug_2005","abstract":"Capecitabine and uracil/ftorafur (UFT) are prodrugs of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) that can be administered orally. Both drugs have been shown to be as effective as bolus 5-FU and folinic acid (FA), both as adjuvant treatment, and for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. However, as the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU has been shown to improve disease-free survival in adjuvant therapy, oxaliplatin/5-FU is currently regarded as the standard adjuvant treatment, rather than fluoropyrimidine monotherapy. For the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, improved response rates and prolonged survival have been reported when irinotecan or oxaliplatin was added to 5-FU/FA; a further increase in efficacy was shown when bevacizumab, an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor, was added to chemotherapy. Studies investigating the substitution of infusional 5-FU with oral compounds in combination therapy (e.g. FOLFOX versus capecitabine/oxaliplatin) are ongoing, but preliminary results in metastatic patients advise caution because of increased toxicity when used with irinotecan, and statistically non-significant trends of a decreased efficacy when used with oxaliplatin. Therefore, the combined use of oral 5-FU prodrugs plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin is not recommended at present. Oral 5-FU prodrugs, however, offer a convenient and less toxic treatment option in adjuvant treatment and in the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma in patients who do not want an intensified regimen, those that have contraindications for implanted venous access devices, and those who are not candidates for a combination therapy with irinotecan and oxaliplatin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"F","given":"olprecht Gunnar"},{"family":"K","given":"√∂hne Claus-Henning"}],"citation-key":"f_drug_2005","container-title":"Nature Clinical Practice Oncology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1038/ncponc0353","ISSN":"1743-4254, 1743-4262","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",11]]},"language":"en","page":"578-587","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Drug Insight: metastatic colorectal cancer‚Äîoral fluoropyrimidines and new perspectives in the adjuvant setting","title-short":"Drug Insight","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncponc0353","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"f_knowledge_2023","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are versatile and can solve different tasks due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs sometimes lack domain-specific knowledge to perform tasks, which would also cause hallucination during inference. In some previous works, additional modules like graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on retrieved knowledge from external knowledge bases, aiming to mitigate the problem of lacking domain-specific knowledge. However, incorporating additional modules: 1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2) would become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver (KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge bases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision sequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot manner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and therefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes. We conduct experiments on three datasets: CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA, and MedQA-USMLE, and found that our approach improves LLM baseline performance by a relatively large margin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"F","given":"eng Chao"},{"family":"Z","given":"hang Xinyu"},{"family":"F","given":"ei Zichu"}],"citation-key":"f_knowledge_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2309.03118","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2309.03118","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Knowledge Solver: Teaching LLMs to Search for Domain Knowledge from Knowledge Graphs","title-short":"Knowledge Solver","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03118"},

The primary end point was response rate (RR).\nRESULTS: A total of 244 patients were randomly assigned. An increase of grade 2 to 3 peripheral neurotoxicity (0% v 19%; P < .001), and grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (28% v 50%; P < .001) were observed in the FOLFOXIRI arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (3% v 5%) and grade 3 to 4 diarrhea (12% v 20%) were not significantly different.

  {"id":"fan_yes1_2018","abstract":"In ÔøΩÔøΩ30% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas whose disease progresses on EGFR inhibitors, the basis for acquired resistance remains unclear. We have integrated transposon mutagenesis screening in an EGFR-mutant cell line and clinical genomic sequencing in cases of acquired resistance to identify mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. The most prominent candidate genes identified by insertions in or near the genes during the screen were MET, a gene whose amplification is known to mediate resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and the gene encoding the Src family kinase YES1. Cell clones with transposon insertions that activated expression of YES1 exhibited resistance to all three generations of EGFR inhibitors and sensitivity to pharmacologic and siRNA-mediated inhibition of YES1 Analysis of clinical genomic sequencing data from cases of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors revealed amplification of YES1 in five cases, four of which lacked any other known mechanisms of resistance. Preinhibitor samples, available for two of the five patients, lacked YES1 amplification. None of 136 postinhibitor samples had detectable amplification of other Src family kinases (SRC and FYN). YES1 amplification was also found in 2 of 17 samples from ALK fusion-positive lung cancer patients who had progressed on ALK TKIs. Taken together, our findings identify acquired amplification of YES1 as a recurrent and targetable mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibition in EGFR-mutant lung cancers and demonstrate the utility of transposon mutagenesis in discovering clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance.","author":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Pang-Dian"},{"family":"Narzisi","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Jayaprakash","given":"Anitha D."},{"family":"Venturini","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Robine","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Smibert","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Germer","given":"Soren"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Helena A."},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Emmet"},{"family":"Paik","given":"Paul K."},{"family":"Janjigian","given":"Yelena Y."},{"family":"Chaft","given":"Jamie E."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Jungbluth","given":"Achim A."},{"family":"Middha","given":"Sumit"},{"family":"Spraggon","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Qiao","given":"Huan"},{"family":"Lovly","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Kris","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Riely","given":"Gregory J."},{"family":"Politi","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Varmus","given":"Harold E."},{"family":"Ladanyi","given":"Marc"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"fan_yes1_2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc.

We conducted a longitudinal, partially prospective cohort study of 123 premenopausal and postmenopausal AGCT patients with a median follow-up time of 10.5 years (range 0.3-50.0 years). Serum AMH and inhibin B levels were measured from 560 pretreatment and follow-up serum samples by using immunoenzymometric assays. We found that serum AMH and inhibin B levels were significantly elevated in patients with primary or recurrent AGCTs. The levels of both markers positively correlated to tumor size (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). AMH and inhibin B performed similarly in receiving operator characteristic analyses; area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-0.95] for AMH, and 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.96) for inhibin B. AMH was highly sensitive (92%) and specific (81%) in detecting a macroscopic AGCT. However, in AUC comparison analyses, the combination of the markers was superior to inhibin B alone. In conclusion, serum AMH is a sensitive and specific marker of AGCT, and either AMH or inhibin B can be monitored during follow-up.

  {"id":"farris_patterns_2018","abstract":"Abstract  Purpose  We aimed to assess patterns of relapse in patients undergoing salvage autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma in the modern era with the hypothesis that patients who suffer a relapse at initially involved sites are at increased risks of relapse post-ASCT that may help guide the application of peri-transplant radiation therapy.  Methods and Materials  A retrospective review was conducted of 38 patients undergoing ASCT between 2002 and 2017 for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. The site of relapse at the time of ASCT and subsequent relapses were compared with sites of the initial involvement at the time of diagnosis using follow-up imaging (most commonly positron emission computed tomography). Relapse and overall survival rates were calculated from the date of ASCT using the Kaplan-Meier method with a multivariate analysis, completed using a Cox multivariate analysis.  Results  The median follow-up time was 38months (interquartile range, 18-66months). Twenty-two patients (58%) suffered a relapse after ASCT at a median time to relapse of 9.1months (interquartile range, 2.9-12.3months) with a 5-year risk of relapse of 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41%-75%). On univariate analysis, relapse at an initially involved site was significant for higher rates of relapse at 71% at 5-years (95% CI, 52%-90%) compared with relapse at initially uninvolved sites at 30% (95% CI, 2%-58%; P=.05).

  {"id":"fassunke_overcoming_2018","abstract":"The emergence of acquired resistance against targeted drugs remains a major clinical challenge in lung adenocarcinoma patients. In a subgroup of these patients we identified an association between selection of EGFRT790M-negative but EGFRG724S-positive subclones and osimertinib resistance. We demonstrate that EGFRG724S limits the activity of third-generation EGFR inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. Structural analyses and computational modeling indicate that EGFRG724S mutations may induce a conformation of the glycine-rich loop, which is incompatible with the binding of third-generation TKIs. Systematic inhibitor screening and in-depth kinetic profiling validate these findings and show that second-generation EGFR inhibitors retain kinase affinity and overcome EGFRG724S-mediated resistance. In the case of afatinib this profile translates into a robust reduction of colony formation and tumor growth of EGFRG724S-driven cells. Our data provide a mechanistic basis for the osimertinib-induced selection of EGFRG724S-mutant clones and a rationale to treat these patients with clinically approved second-generation EGFR inhibitors.","author":[{"family":"Fassunke","given":"Jana"},{"family":"MÁæπller","given":"Fabienne"},{"family":"Keul","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Michels","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Dammert","given":"Marcel A."},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Plenker","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Lategahn","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Heydt","given":"Carina"},{"family":"BrÁì£gelmann","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Tumbrink","given":"Hannah L."},{"family":"Alber","given":"Yannic"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Heimsoeth","given":"Alena"},{"family":"Dahmen","given":"Ilona"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Rieke"},{"family":"Scheffler","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Ihle","given":"Michaela Angelika"},{"family":"Priesner","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Scheel","given":"Andreas H."},{"family":"Wagener","given":"Svenja"},{"family":"Kron","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Frank","given":"Konrad"},{"family":"Garbert","given":"Katia"},{"family":"Persigehl","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"PÁæπsken","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Haneder","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Schaaf","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Rodermann","given":"Ernst"},{"family":"Engel-Riedel","given":"Walburga"},{"family":"Felip","given":"Enriqueta"},{"family":"Smit","given":"Egbert F."},{"family":"Merkelbach-Bruse","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Reinhardt","given":"H.

A complex diagnosis is based on pathologic, radiologic, and clinical findings, with controversies about what is the best therapeutic strategy. Objective: Our objective was to provide an overview of the clinical, pathologic, and therapeutic aspects of this rare tumor. Conclusions: mPT is a rare presentation of breast cancer and a challenge in clinical practice. A multidisciplinary approach should take into account some aspects like pathogenic mutations and hereditary syndromes. Oncologic surgery is the fundamental approach, and the use of adjuvant therapies is still controversial due to the lack of clinical trials. Treatment recommendations should be individualized according to patient risk and preferences.

  {"id":"fedullo_prognostic_2018","abstract":"To shed light onto the molecular basis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and to investigate the prognostic role of additional genomic lesions, we analyzed copy number aberrations using the Cytoscan HD Array in 116 newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in four different GIMEMA protocols, all based on a chemotherapy-free induction strategy. This analysis showed that patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia carry an average of 7.8 lesions/case, with deletions outnumbering gains (88% versus 12%). The most common deletions were those targeting IKZF1, PAX5 and CDKN2A/B, which were detected in 84%, 36% and 32% of cases, respectively. Patients carrying simultaneous deletions of IKZF1 plus CDKN2A/B and/or PAX5 had a significantly lower disease-free survival rate (24.9% versus 43.3%; P=0.026). The only IKZF1 isoform affecting prognosis was the dominant negative one (P=0.003). Analysis of copy number aberrations showed that 18% of patients harbored MEF2C deletions, which were of two types, differing in size: the longer deletions were associated with the achievement of a complete molecular remission (P=0.05) and had a favorable impact on disease-free survival (64.3% versus 32.1% at 36 months; P=0.031). These findings retained statistical significance also in multivariate analysis (P=0.057). KRAS deletions, detected in 6% of cases, were associated with the achievement of a complete molecular remission (P=0.009). These results indicate that in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia a detailed evaluation of additional deletions - including CDKN2A/B, PAX5, IKZF1, MEF2C and KRAS - has prognostic implications and should be incorporated in the design of more personalized treatment strategies.","author":[{"family":"Fedullo","given":"Anna Lucia"},{"family":"Messina","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Elia","given":"Loredana"},{"family":"Piciocchi","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Gianfelici","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Lauretti","given":"Alessia"},{"family":"Soddu","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Puzzolo","given":"Maria Cristina"},{"family":"Minotti","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Ferrara","given":"Felicetto"},{"family":"Martino","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Chiusolo","given":"Patrizia"},{"family":"Calafiore","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Paolini","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Vignetti","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Vitale","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Guarini","given":"Anna"},{"family":"FoÔøΩ","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Chiaretti","given":"Sabina"}],"citation-key":"fedullo_prognostic_2018","container-title":"Haematologica","container-title-short":"Haematologica","DOI":"10.3324/haematol.2018.196055","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"312-318","title":"Prognostic implications of additional genomic lesions in adult philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","type":"article-journal","volume":"104"},

We assessed the safety and activity of ceritinib plus nivolumab in these patients. Methods In this open-label, phase 1B, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study, previously treated (with ALK receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK] inhibitor [ALKI]/chemotherapy) or treatment-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV ALK-rearranged NSCLC received nivolumab, 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, plus ceritinib, 450 mg/300 mg daily, with a low-fat meal. Results In total, 36 patients were treated (a 450-mg cohort [n=14] and a 300-mg cohort [n=22]). In the 450-mg cohort, four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. In the 300-mg cohort, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. Among ALKI-naive patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35.9ÔøΩÔøΩ99.6) in the 450-mg cohort and 60% (95% CI: 26.2ÔøΩÔøΩ87.8) in the 300-mg cohort.

In this trial, we aimed to assess the effect of azacitidine on overall survival compared with the three commonest conventional care regimens. Methods In a phase III, international, multicentre, controlled, parallel-group, open-label trial, patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes were randomly assigned one-to-one to receive azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 per day for 7 days every 28 days) or conventional care (best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine, or intensive chemotherapy as selected by investigators before randomisation). Patients were stratified by French‚ÄìAmerican‚ÄìBritish and international prognostic scoring system classifications; randomisation was done with a block size of four.

In the GIMEMA LAL1205 protocol, patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL older than 18 years (with no upper age limit) received dasatinib induction therapy for 84 days combined with steroids for the first 32 days and intrathecal chemotherapy. Postremission therapy was free. Fifty-three patients were evaluable (median age, 53.6 years). All patients achieved a complete hematologic remission (CHR), 49 (92.5%) at day 22. At this time point, 10 patients achieved a BCR-ABL reduction to < 10ÔøΩÔøΩ3. At 20 months, the overall survival was 69.2% and disease-free survival was 51.1%. A significant difference in DFS was observed between patients who showed at day 22 a decrease in BCR-ABL levels to < 10ÔøΩÔøΩ3 compared with patients who never reached these levels during induction. In multivariate analysis, BCR-ABL levels of < 10ÔøΩÔøΩ3 at day 85 correlated with disease-free survival. No deaths or relapses occurred during induction. Twenty-three patients relapsed after completing induction. A T315I mutation was detected in 12 of 17 relapsed cases. Treatment was well tolerated; only 4 patients discontinued therapy during the last phase of the induction when already in CHR. In adult Ph+ ALL, induction treatment with dasatinib plus steroids is associated with a CHR in virtually all patients, irrespective of age, good compliance, no deaths, and a very rapid debulking of the neoplastic clone.

Molecular remission is a primary goal of treatment.\nMETHODS We conducted a phase 2 single-group trial of first-line therapy in adults with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL (with no upper age limit). Dasatinib plus glucocorticoids were administered, followed by two cycles of blinatumomab. The primary end point was a sustained molecular response in the bone marrow after this treatment.\nRESULTS Of the 63 patients (median age, 54 years; range, 24 to 82) who were enrolled, a complete remission was observed in 98%. At the end of dasatinib induction therapy (day 85), 29% of the patients had a molecular response, and this percentage increased to 60% after two cycles of blinatumomab; the percentage of patients with a molecular response increased further after additional blinatumomab cycles. At a median follow-up of 18 months, overall survival was 95% and disease-free survival was 88%; disease-free survival was lower among patients who had an IKZF1 deletion plus additional genetic aberrations (CDKN2A or CDKN2B, PAX5, or both [i.e., IKZF1plus]). ABL1 mutations were detected in 6 patients who had increased minimal residual disease during induction therapy, and all these mutations were cleared by blinatumomab. Six relapses occurred. Overall, 21 adverse events of grade 3 or higher were recorded. A total of 24 patients received a stem-cell allograft, and 1 death was related to transplantation (4%).\nCONCLUSIONS A chemotherapy-free induction and consolidation first-line treatment with dasatinib and blinatumomab that was based on a targeted and immunotherapeutic strategy was associated with high incidences of molecular response and survival and few toxic effects of grade 3 or higher in adults with Ph-positive ALL.

Cancer-related interventions such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and indwelling central venous catheters also increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. Low molecular weight heparin for at least 3‚Äì6 months is the current standard of care for the treatment of cancer associated venous thromboembolism. Anticoagulation should be continued as long as the cancer is active. Over the past few years, direct oral anticoagulants have emerged, including one direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran etexilate) and three factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban). In the randomized controlled trials comparing direct oral anticoagulants with vitamin K antagonists, the direct oral anticoagulants all provide non-inferior in prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation, for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and in acute coronary syndrome. In people with cancer, these drugs have emerged as attractive alternatives for the treatment of venous thromboembolism with the potential to overcome the limitations of low molecular weight heparin. Randomized controlled studies comparing direct oral anticoagulants to low molecular weight heparin in cancer patients are still limited and direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended for the treatment of cancer associated venous thromboembolism yet. However, new emerging data are supporting the use of direct oral anticoagulants in cancer-associated thrombosis.

  {"id":"freedman_follicular_2020","abstract":"Disease overview Follicular lymphoma (FL) is generally an indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular center B cells. Follicular lymphoma is characterized by diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, and splenomegaly. Extranodal involvement is less common. Cytopenias are relatively common but constitutional symptoms of fever, night sweats, and weight loss are uncommon in the absence of transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Diagnosis The diagnosis is based on histology from a biopsy of a lymph node or other affected tissue. Incisional biopsy is preferred over needle biopsies in order to give adequate tissue to assign grade and assess for transformation. Immunohistochemical staining is positive in virtually all cases for cell surface CD19, CD20, CD10 and monoclonal immunoglobulin, as well as cytoplasmic expression of bcl-2 protein. The overwhelming majority of cases have the characteristic t(14;18) translocation involving the IgH/bcl-2 genes. Risk stratification The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) uses five independent predictors of inferior survival: age > 60 years, hemoglobin <12 g/dL, serum LDH > normal, Ann Arbor stage III/IV, number of involved nodal areas >4. The presence of 0-1, 2, and ‚â• 3 adverse factors defines low, intermediate, and high-risk disease. There are other clinical prognostic models but the FLIPI remains the most common. Other factors such as time to relapse of less than 2 years from chemoimmunotherapy and specific gene mutations may also be useful for prognosis. Regardless of the prognostic model used, modern therapies have demonstrably improved prognosis. Risk-adapted therapy Observation continues to be appropriate for asymptomatic patients with low bulk disease and no cytopenias. There is no overall survival advantage for early treatment with either chemotherapy or single agent rituximab. For patients needing therapy, most patients are treated with chemoimmunotherapy, which has improved response rates, duration of response and overall survival (OS). Randomized studies have shown additional benefit for maintenance rituximab. Lenalidomide was non-inferior to chemoimmunotherapy in a randomized front-line study and, when combined with rituximab, was superior to rituximab alone in relapsed FL. Kinase inhibitors, other immunotherapies, and stem cell transplantation (SCT) are also considered for recurrent disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Freedman","given":"Arnold"},{"family":"Jacobsen","given":"Eric"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"freedman_follicular_2020","container-title":"American Journal of Hematology","container-title-short":"Am.

  {"id":"friedlaender_egfr_2022","abstract":"Protein tyrosine kinases of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family, including EGFR and HER2, have emerged as important therapeutic targets in non-small-cell lung, breast and gastroesophageal cancers, and are of relevance for the treatment of various other malignancies (particularly colorectal cancer). Classic activating EGFR exon 19 deletions and exon 21 mutations, and HER2 amplification and/or overexpression, are predictive of response to matched molecularly targeted therapies, translating into favourable objective response rates and survival outcomes. By comparison, cancers with insertion mutations in exon 20 of either EGFR or HER2 are considerably less sensitive to the currently available tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibodies targeting these receptors. These exon 20 insertions are structurally distinct from other EGFR and HER2 mutations, providing an explanation for this lack of sensitivity. In this Review, we first discuss the prevalence and pan-cancer distribution of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertions, their biology and detection, and associated responses to current molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies. We then focus on novel approaches that are being developed to more effectively target tumours driven by these non-classic EGFR and HER2 alterations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Subbiah","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Banna","given":"Giuseppe Luigi"},{"family":"Malapelle","given":"Umberto"},{"family":"Rolfo","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Addeo","given":"Alfredo"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"friedlaender_egfr_2022","container-title":"Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1038/s41571-021-00558-1","ISSN":"1759-4782","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"1","page":"51-69","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"78.8","title":"EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertions in solid tumours: from biology to treatment","title-short":"EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertions in solid tumours","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-021-00558-1","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"fuchs_randomized_2007","abstract":"PURPOSE: This phase III study compared the safety and efficacy of the following three different irinotecan-containing regimens in the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: irinotecan plus infusional fluorouracil (FU)/leucovorin (LV) (FOLFIRI), irinotecan plus bolus FU/LV (mIFL), and irinotecan plus oral capecitabine (CapeIRI).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 430 previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive FOLFIRI (n = 144), mIFL (n = 141), or CapeIRI (n = 145). Patients were concurrently randomly assigned to a double-blind treatment with celecoxib or placebo. After a protocol amendment, an additional 117 patients were randomly assigned to either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (FOLFIRI+Bev; n = 57) or mILF plus bevacizumab (mIFL+Bev; n = 60), whereas the CapeIRI arm was discontinued. The primary study end point was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary end points of overall survival (OS), response rate, and toxicity.\nRESULTS: Median PFS was 7.6 months for FOLFIRI, 5.9 months for mIFL (P = .004 for the comparison with FOLFIRI), and 5.8 months for CapeIRI (P = .015). Median OS was 23.1 months for FOLFIRI, 17.6 months for mIFL (P = .09), and 18.9 months for CapeIRI (P = .27). CapeIRI was associated with higher rates of severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. After the amendment to add bevacizumab, the median survival time has not yet been reached for FOLFIRI+Bev and was 19.2 months for mIFL+Bev (P = .007). FOLFIRI+Bev was associated with a higher rate of > or = grade 3 hypertension than mIFL+Bev.\nCONCLUSION: FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI+Bev offered superior activity to their comparators and were comparably safe. An infusional schedule of FU should be the preferred irinotecan-based regimen in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer.","author":[{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Charles S."},{"family":"Marshall","given":"John"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Edith"},{"family":"Wierzbicki","given":"Rafal"},{"family":"Ganju","given":"Vinod"},{"family":"Jeffery","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Schulz","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Richards","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Soufi-Mahjoubi","given":"Raoudha"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Barrueco","given":"Jos√©"}],"citation-key":"fuchs_randomized_2007","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2007.11.3357","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"4779-4786","PMID":"17947725","source":"PubMed","title":"Randomized, controlled trial of irinotecan plus infusional, bolus, or oral fluoropyrimidines in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: results from the BICC-C Study","title-short":"Randomized, controlled trial of irinotecan plus infusional, bolus, or oral fluoropyrimidines in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

To determine the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors within clinically-relevant molecular subgroups, we retrospectively evaluated response patterns among EGFR-mutant, ALK-positive, and EGFR wild-type/ALK-negative patients. Experimental Design: We identified 58 patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Objective response rates (ORRs) were assessed using RECIST v1.1. PD-L1 expression and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results: Objective responses were observed in 1/28 (3.6%) EGFR-mutant or ALK-positive patients versus 7/30 (23.3%) EGFR wild-type and ALK-negative/unknown patients (P = 0.053). The ORR among never- or light- ({less than or equal to}10 pack years) smokers was 4.2% versus 20.6% among heavy smokers (P = 0.123). In an independent cohort of advanced, EGFR-mutant (N=68) and ALK-positive (N=27) patients, PD-L1 expression was observed in 24%/16%/11% and 63%/47%/26% of pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) biopsies using cutoffs of {greater than or equal to}1%, {greater than or equal to}5% and {greater than or equal to}50% tumor cell staining, respectively. Among EGFR-mutant patients with paired, pre- and post-TKI resistant biopsies (N=57), PD-L1 expression levels changed after resistance in 16 (28%) patients. Concurrent PD-L1 expression ({greater than or equal to}5%) and high levels of CD8+ TILs (grade {greater than or equal to}2) were observed in only 1 pre-treatment (2.1%) and 5 resistant (11.6%) EGFR-mutant specimens, and was not observed in any ALK-positive, pre- or post-TKI specimens. Conclusions: NSCLCs harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements are associated with low ORRs to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Low rates of concurrent PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TILs within the tumor microenvironment may underlie these clinical observations.","author":[{"family":"Gainor","given":"Justin F."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Fu","given":"Xiujun"},{"family":"Azzoli","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Piotrowska","given":"Zofia"},{"family":"Huynh","given":"Tiffany"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Fulton","given":"Linnea"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Howe","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Farago","given":"Anna F."},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Stone","given":"James R."},{"family":"Digumarthy","given":"Subba R."},{"family":"Moran","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Hata","given":"Aaron N."},{"family":"Yagi","given":"Yukako"},{"family":"Yeap","given":"Beow Y."},{"family":"Engelman","given":"Jeffrey A."},{"family":"Mino-Kenudson","given":"Mari"}],"citation-key":"gainor_egfr_2016","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

  {"id":"gainor_molecular_2016","abstract":"Advanced, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lung cancer is currently treated with the first-generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib followed by more potent, second-generation ALK inhibitors (e.g., ceritinib, alectinib) upon progression. Second-generation inhibitors are generally effective even in the absence of crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, likely reflecting incomplete inhibition of ALK by crizotinib in many cases. Herein, we analyzed 103 repeat biopsies from ALK-positive patients progressing on various ALK inhibitors. We find that each ALK inhibitor is associated with a distinct spectrum of ALK resistance mutations and that the frequency of one mutation - ALK G1202R - increases significantly after treatment with second-generation agents. To investigate strategies to overcome resistance to second-generation ALK inhibitors, we examine the activity of the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib in a series of ceritinib-resistant, patient-derived cell lines, and observe that the presence of ALK resistance mutations is highly predictive for sensitivity to lorlatinib, whereas those cell lines without ALK mutations are resistant.","author":[{"family":"Gainor","given":"Justin F."},{"family":"Dardaei","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Yoda","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Friboulet","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Leshchiner","given":"Ignaty"},{"family":"Katayama","given":"Ryohei"},{"family":"Dagogo-Jack","given":"Ibiayi"},{"family":"Gadgeel","given":"Shirish M."},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Manrose"},{"family":"Chin","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Parks","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Dana"},{"family":"DiCecca","given":"Richard H."},{"family":"Lockerman","given":"Elizabeth L."},{"family":"Huynh","given":"Tiffany"},{"family":"Logan","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Ritterhouse","given":"Lauren L."},{"family":"Le","given":"Long P."},{"family":"Muniappan","given":"Ashok"},{"family":"Digumarthy","given":"Subba R."},{"family":"Channick","given":"Colleen L."},{"family":"Keyes","given":"Colleen"},{"family":"Getz","given":"Gad"},{"family":"Dias-Santagata","given":"Dora"},{"family":"Heist","given":"Rebecca S."},{"family":"Lennerz","given":"Jochen K."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Benes","given":"Cyril H."},{"family":"Iafrate","given":"A.

  {"id":"gaoxin_clinical_2015","abstract":"Introduction Break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the FDA-approved assay for detecting anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangements in nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), identifying patients who can gain dramatic benefit from ALK kinase inhibitors. Assay interpretation can be technically challenging, and either splitting of the 5' and 3' probes or loss of the 5' probe constitute rearrangement. We hypothesized that there may be clinical differences depending on rearrangement pattern on FISH. Methods An IRB-approved database of NSCLC patients at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute was queried for ALK rearrangement. Clinical characteristics and response to crizotinib were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) were obtained when available. Results Of 1614 NSCLC patients with ALK testing, 82 patients (5.1%) had ALK rearrangement by FISH: 30 patients with split signals, 25 patients with 5' deletion, and 27 patients with details unavailable. Patients with 5' deletion were older ( p = 0.01) and tended to have more extensive smoking histories ( p = 0.08). IHC was positive for ALK rearrangement in all 27 patients with FISH split signals, whereas three of 21 patients with FISH 5' deletion had negative IHC (p = 0.05). Targeted NGS on two of three cases with discordant FISH and IHC results did not identify ALK rearrangement, instead finding driver mutations in EGFR and KRAS. Patients with 5' deletion treated with crizotinib had a smaller magnitude of tumor response ( p = 0.03). Conclusions Patients with 5' deletion on ALK FISH harbor features less typical of ALK -rearranged tumors, potentially indicating that some cases with this variant are false positives. Corroborative testing with IHC or NGS may be beneficial.","author":[{"family":"Gao Xin","given":""},{"family":"Sholl","given":"Lynette M."},{"family":"Nishino","given":"Mizuki"},{"family":"Heng","given":"Jennifer C."},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."},{"family":"Oxnard","given":"Geoffrey R."}],"citation-key":"gaoxin_clinical_2015","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"garcia-manero_hypomethylating_2011","abstract":"Over the last decade, treatment approaches for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have improved significantly. Treatment of MDS is tailored to the specific risk characteristics of the patient. In general, patients are divided into lower- and higher-risk categories. Without therapy, prognosis of patients with higher-risk MDS is poor, and treatments should be directed to improve survival. Prognosis of patients with lower-risk MDS is more heterogeneous, and therapies are usually directed to minimize transfusion needs and potentially to alter the natural course of the disease. Treatment options for patients with higher-risk MDS include hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine), intensive chemotherapy (ICT), and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT). The use of the hypomethylating agents has transformed the approach to this patient population, in particular older individuals, for whom ICT and alloSCT are not an option. In lower-risk MDS, treatment strategies are used sequentially and usually include observation in patients with low risk and no transfusion dependency, growth factors, and lenalidomide for patients with alteration of chromosome 5 and anemia. The use of hypomethylating agents is less understood in this group of patients. AlloSCT is usually reserved for patients with lower-risk MDS closer to the time of transformation. In this short review, we discuss treatment alternatives for patients with MDS and delineate some of the ongoing challenges, including the development of better front-line strategies for patients with higher-risk disease, the concept of altering the natural course of the disease in lower-risk MDS, and the development of new treatment approaches for patients who do not benefit from hypomethylating agents.","author":[{"family":"Garcia-Manero","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Fenaux","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"garcia-manero_hypomethylating_2011","container-title":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J.

Aims: The aim of the present analysis was to see how treatment with or without Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs) and/or red blood cell transfusions (RBCT) impact overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Methods: Patient management was recorded electronically every 6 months (‚Äúvisit‚Äù) in a central database, including treatment, transfusions, blood values, and health related quality of life (HRQoL) using the EQ-5D 3-Level index and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patients were eligible to be included in the analyses if their hemoglobin was recorded as less than <10 g/dl at a visit. To overcome potential confounding by non-random allocation of ESA treatment, propensity score matching was performed to ensure that treated and untreated patients had similar characteristics. Only patients with comparable propensity scores were included in the analyses to estimate the effects of ESA treatment on outcomes using standard time to event analyses; OS was estimated from the first visit a Hb value of <10g/dl was recorded. OS was examined for patients treated with ESA stratified by their transfusion status prior to commencing ESA treatment (no RBCT, <4 units, ‚â•4 units). Patients were separated into 4 groups at each clinical visit, depending on the treatment received in the interval leading up to that visit; no ESA nor RBCT, ESA only, ESA and RBCT and RBCT only. HRQoL at each visit according to the treatment status was summarized for patients who had completed a questionnaire at visit 1 and 2; mean values were examined by treatment group. Results: Of 2562 patients registered by November 2021, 2448 were diagnosed before July 2019 and included in the analysis; these patients were divided into two groups: ESA untreated (n=1265) and ESA treated (n=1183). Patients whose Hb remained above 10g/dl were excluded leaving 529 untreated patients and 749 ESA treated; after propensity score matching was applied two comparable groups were produced: ESA untreated (n= 426) and ESA treated (n= 742). Median OS from reaching the eligibility criteria in the ESA treated vs untreated groups were 44.9 and 34.8 months respectively (Fig 1a), giving a clear survival advantage to the ESA-treated group. (p<0.003). In the ESA-treated group, OS was poorer in those who had been transfused prior to commencing ESA (Fig 1b, p<0.001). Fig 1c shows the number of patients at each visit who had been treated with transfusions or ESA; 647/1278 had received neither at visit 1, the figure shows the ‚Äúflow‚Äù of patients by treatment for the first 6 visits. HRQoL was examined for the 695 patients who had completed a questionnaire at both visit 1 and 2 up to visit 6; differences were seen by treatment (Fig 1d). Patients who had received no treatment reported, on average, the highest mean HRQoL, in contrast, patients who had RBCT had the lowest (p<0.001). Image:Summary/Conclusion: This unique large prospective registry study clearly shows a significant survival advantage for lower-risk MDS patients exposed to ESA treatment at onset of anemia (Hb <10g/dL) but before onset of transfusion therapy, strongly supporting recommendations to start ESA treatment early. The effect on patients with an early transfusion need warrants further studies. Moreover, ESA exposure is associated with maintained QoL, while RBCT development with or without ESA exposure is associated with significantly deterioration in QoL.","author":[{"family":"Garelius","given":"H."},{"family":"Smith","given":"A."},{"family":"Bagguley","given":"T."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"A."},{"family":"Fenaux","given":"P."},{"family":"Bowen","given":"D."},{"family":"Symeonidis","given":"A."},{"family":"Mittelmann","given":"M."},{"family":"Stauder","given":"R."},{"family":"ƒåerm√°k","given":"J."},{"family":"Sanz","given":"G."},{"family":"Langemeijer","given":"S."},{"family":"Malcovati","given":"L."},{"family":"Germing","given":"U."},{"family":"Itzykson","given":"R."},{"family":"Guerci-Bresler","given":"A."},{"family":"Culligan","given":"D."},{"family":"Kotsianidis","given":"I."},{"family":"Koinig","given":"Mag K."},{"family":"van","given":"Marrewijk C."},{"family":"Crouch","given":"S."},{"family":"de","given":"Witte T."},{"family":"Hellstr√∂m-Lindberg","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"garelius_s168_2022","container-title":"HemaSphere","DOI":"10.1097/01.hs9.0000843564.40783.b4","issue":"NA","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"69-70","title":"S168: ERYTHROPOIETIN STIMULATION AGENTS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES OUTCOME IN LOWER RISK MDS.","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

Somatic activating mutations of the EGFR gene, increased gene copy number and certain clinical and pathological features have been associated with dramatic tumor responses and favorable clinical outcomes with these agents in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The specific types of activating mutations that confer sensitivity to EGFR TKIs are present in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the EGFR gene. Exon 19 deletion mutations and the single-point substitution mutation L858R in exon 21 are the most frequent in NSCLC and are termed 'classical' mutations. The NSCLC tumors insensitive to EGFR TKIs include those driven by the KRAS and MET oncogenes. Most patients who initially respond to gefitinib and erlotinib eventually become resistant and experience progressive disease. The point mutation T790M accounts for about one half of these cases of acquired resistance. Various second-generation EGFR TKIs are currently being evaluated and may have the potential to overcome T790M-mediated resistance by virtue of their irreversible inhibition of the receptor TK domain.","author":[{"family":"Gazdar","given":"Adi F."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"gazdar_activating_2009","container-title":"Oncogene","DOI":"10.1038/onc.2009.198","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"S24-31","source":"8","title":"Activating and resistance mutations of EGFR in non-small-cell lung cancer: role in clinical response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

In this review, we evaluated whether molecular profiling of MPEs with next generation sequencing (NGS) could have a role in cancer management, focusing on lung cancer. We reviewed and compared the diagnostic performance of pleural fluid liquid biopsy with other types of samples. When applied in MPEs, NGS may have comparable performance with corresponding tissue biopsies, yield higher DNA amount, and detect more genetic aberrations than blood-derived liquid biopsies. NGS in MPEs may also be preferable to plasma liquid biopsy in advanced cancer patients with a MPE and a paucicellular or it could be difficult to obtain tissue/fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Of interest, post-centrifuge supernatant NGS may exhibit superior results compared to cell pellet, cell block or other materials. NGS in MPEs can also guide clinicians in tailoring established therapies and identifying therapy resistance. Evidence is still premature regarding the role of NGS in MPEs from patients with cancers other than lung.

  {"id":"ghafouri_ai_2023","abstract":"The introduction of ChatGPT and the subsequent improvement of Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted more and more individuals to turn to the use of ChatBots, both for information and assistance with decision-making. However, the information the user is after is often not formulated by these ChatBots objectively enough to be provided with a definite, globally accepted answer. Controversial topics, such as \"religion\", \"gender identity\", \"freedom of speech\", and \"equality\", among others, can be a source of conflict as partisan or biased answers can reinforce preconceived notions or promote disinformation. By exposing ChatGPT to such debatable questions, we aim to understand its level of awareness and if existing models are subject to socio-political and/or economic biases. We also aim to explore how AI-generated answers compare to human ones. For exploring this, we use a dataset of a social media platform created for the purpose of debating human-generated claims on polemic subjects among users, dubbed Kialo. Our results show that while previous versions of ChatGPT have had important issues with controversial topics, more recent versions of ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) are no longer manifesting significant explicit biases in several knowledge areas. In particular, it is well-moderated regarding economic aspects. However, it still maintains degrees of implicit libertarian leaning toward right-winged ideals which suggest the need for increased moderation from the socio-political point of view. In terms of domain knowledge on controversial topics, with the exception of the \"Philosophical\" category, ChatGPT is performing well in keeping up with the collective human level of knowledge. Finally, we see that sources of Bing AI have slightly more tendency to the center when compared to human answers. All the analyses we make are generalizable to other types of biases and domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghafouri","given":"Vahid"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Vibhor"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Sastry","given":"Nishanth"},{"family":"Such","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Suarez-Tangil","given":"Guillermo"}],"citation-key":"ghafouri_ai_2023","DOI":"10.1145/3583780.3614777","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"AI in the Gray: Exploring Moderation Policies in Dialogic Large Language Models vs. Human Answers in Controversial Topics","title-short":"AI in the Gray","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14608"},

The first set was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT's performance was compared to 2 other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question.\nRESULTS: Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT's answer selection was present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P<.001) and NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT's capacity to provide logic and informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as an interactive medical education tool to support learning.","author":[{"family":"Gilson","given":"Aidan"},{"family":"Safranek","given":"Conrad W."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Socrates","given":"Vimig"},{"family":"Chi","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Richard Andrew"},{"family":"Chartash","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"gilson_how_2023","container-title":"JMIR medical education","container-title-short":"JMIR Med Educ","DOI":"10.2196/45312","ISSN":"2369-3762","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e45312","PMCID":"PMC9947764","PMID":"36753318","source":"PubMed","title":"How Does ChatGPT Perform on the United States Medical Licensing Examination?

  {"id":"goldberg_randomized_2004","abstract":"Purpose\n\nThree agents with differing mechanisms of action are available for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer: fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. In this study, we compared the activity and toxicity of three different two-drug combinations in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had not been treated previously for advanced disease.\n\nPatients and Methods\n\nPatients were concurrently randomly assigned to receive irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin (IFL, control combination), oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FOLFOX), or irinotecan and oxaliplatin (IROX). The primary end point was time to progression, with secondary end points of response rate, survival time, and toxicity.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 795 patients were randomly assigned between May 1999 and April 2001. A median time to progression of 8.7 months, response rate of 45%, and median survival time of 19.5 months were observed for FOLFOX. These results were significantly superior to those observed for IFL for all end points (6.9 months, 31%, and 15.0 months, respectively) or for IROX (6.5 months, 35%, and 17.4 months, respectively) for time to progression and response. The FOLFOX regimen had significantly lower rates of severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and dehydration. Sensory neuropathy and neutropenia were more common with the regimens containing oxaliplatin.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FOLFOX regimen of oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin was active and comparatively safe.

  {"id":"goldstein_dose_2020","abstract":"Background Osimertinib is a selective irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) with increased penetration across the blood-brain barrier compared with previous EGFR-TKIs, and thus, a 52% reduction in the risk of intracranial disease progression is seen when it is used as a first line of therapy compared with gefitinib and erlotinib. It is also efficient as second-line therapy for patients who developed the T790M resistance mutation following treatment with previous generation TKIs. Here, we report 11 patients who were treated by an increasing dose of osimertinib from 80 mg to 160 mg QD orally following intracranial progression in either first- or second-line setting. Methods This is a subcohort analysis from a larger nonrandomized, phase 2, open-label trial, evaluating the efficacy of osimertinib dose escalation from 80 mg to 160 mg in EGFR-mutated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with intracranial progression in either first- (arm A) or second-line setting (arm B for T790M+ and C for T790M-). Results Eleven patients, 5 in arm A, 4 in arm B, and 2 in arm C were reported in this study. The mPFS of osimertinib before dose escalation was 11.4 Á∞£ 8.9 (6.6-30.7) months for arm A, 8.7 Á∞£ 1.8 (6.3-11.2) for arm B, and 14.5 Á∞£ 7.8 (6.7-22.3) for arm C. Intracranial response rate to dose escalation was 54% (6 of 11) with 2 of 11 having intracranial stability. Median iPFS was 4.3 Á∞£ 7.4 (0.7-25.5) months; 3.8 Á∞£ 6.4 (1.8-18.9), 5.6 Á∞£ 9.7 (0.7-25.5), and 7.0 Á∞£ 2.7 (4.3-9.6) for arms A/B/C, respectively. Dose escalation was well tolerated with diarrhea and paronychia as the main dose-limiting symptoms.

  {"id":"gomez-outes_causes_2018","abstract":"Abstract\n            Death is more frequent than nonfatal recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding after acute VTE. The analysis of the causes of death is fundamental to explore new strategies to reduce mortality rates in these patients. The authors performed a meta-analysis to analyze mortality and independently adjudicated causes of death in anticoagulated patients due to VTE, and to evaluate potential differences between different anticoagulant schemes. They searched MEDLINE and CENTRAL, from January 1, 2000, to January 31, 2017, and performed additional searches in Web sites of regulatory agencies, clinical trial registers, and conference proceedings. Two investigators independently selected studies and extracted the data. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized studies. Seven prospective randomized trials in 29,844 patients (22,025 patient-year follow-up) were included, comparing dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban with the standard anticoagulant treatment of VTE. A total of 718 patients died during the follow-up (3.4% per year; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3‚Äì4.8). The most frequent causes of death were cancer (42%), followed by VTE (20%), infections (13%), hemorrhage (6%), heart disease (4%), and stroke (2%). There were no differences in the overall survival and causes of death according to the anticoagulant type. Concomitant active cancer during the study was significantly associated with death (odds ratio: 15.2; 95% CI: 9.2‚Äì25.1). Cancer is the leading cause of death in contemporary VTE trials. Interventions beyond anticoagulation, particularly in patients with active cancer, are needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"G√≥mez-Outes","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Terleira-Fern√°ndez","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Lecumberri","given":"Ram√≥n"},{"family":"Su√°rez-Gea","given":"M¬™"},{"family":"Calvo-Rojas","given":"Gonzalo"},{"family":"Vargas-Castrill√≥n","given":"Emilio"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"gomez-outes_causes_2018","container-title":"Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis","container-title-short":"Semin Thromb Hemost","DOI":"10.1055/s-0038-1642644","ISSN":"0094-6176, 1098-9064","issue":"04","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"language":"en","page":"377-387","source":"6.398","title":"Causes of Death in Patients with Venous Thromboembolism Anticoagulated with Direct Oral Anticoagulants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","title-short":"Causes of Death in Patients with Venous Thromboembolism Anticoagulated with Direct Oral Anticoagulants","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0038-1642644","volume":"44"},

R-CHOP is the standard first line therapy and cures more than 60% of patients. Salvage high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant remains the standard second-line treatment for relapsed or refractory patients, and recently, three CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART) cell products have been approved beyond 2 prior lines of systemic therapy. Nevertheless, some patients are not eligible for transplant or CARTs, or progress after these treatments. In this context, IgG-like bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have been designed to treat B‚Äêcell lymphomas. They combine two different monospecific antigen‚Äêbinding regions that target CD20 on B cells and engage T cells via CD3 in a 1:1 or 2:1 CD20:CD3 antigen binding fragment (Fab) format. The results of different phase 1 trials with BsAbs, including mosunetuzumab, glofitamab, epcoritamab and odeonextamab, have been recently published. They are infused intravenously or subcutaneously, and have a favorable toxicity profile, with reduced cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicity.

  {"id":"gorcenco_new_2020","abstract":"New generation sequencing (NGS) genetic testing is a powerful diagnostic tool and is increasingly used in the clinical workup of patients, especially in unusual presentations or where a positive family history suggests heritable disease. This review addresses the NGS technologies Targeted sequencing (TS), Whole exome sequencing (WES), Whole genome sequencing (WGS), and the use of gene panels or gene lists for clinical diagnostic purposes. These methods primarily assess nucleotide sequence but can also detect copy number variants and many tandem repeat expansions, greatly simplifying diagnostic algorithms for movement disorders. Studies evaluating the efficacy of NGS in diagnosing movement disorders have reported a diagnostic yield of up to 10.1% for familial and 15.7% for early-onset PD, 11.7‚Äì37.5% for dystonia, 12.1‚Äì61.8% for ataxia/spastic paraplegia and 11.3‚Äì28% for combined movement disorders. Patient selection and stringency in the interpretation of the detected variants and genotypes affect diagnostic yield. Careful comparison of the patient's or family's disease features with the previously reported phenotype associated with the same variant or gene can avoid false-positive diagnoses, although some genes are implicated in various phenotypes. Moving from TS to WES and WGS increases the number of patients correctly diagnosed, but for many patients, a genetic cause cannot be identified today. However, new genetically defined entities are discovered at rapid pace, and genetic databases and our knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations expand steadily. We discuss the need for clear communication of genetic results and suggest a list of aspects to consider when reporting neurogenetic disorders using NGS testing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorcenco","given":"Sorina"},{"family":"Ilinca","given":"Andreea"},{"family":"Almasoudi","given":"Wejdan"},{"family":"Kafantari","given":"Efthymia"},{"family":"Lindgren","given":"Arne G."},{"family":"Puschmann","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"gorcenco_new_2020","container-title":"Parkinsonism & Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Parkinsonism & Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.parkreldis.2020.02.015","ISSN":"1353-8020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"page":"72-84","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"New generation genetic testing entering the clinic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353802020300444","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"gran_prothrombotic_2018","abstract":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication in cancer. Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of VTE-related complications such as major bleeding during anticoagulant treatment, recurrence and mortality. Therefore, it is important to identify cancer patients with high risk of VTE in order to implement targeted prevention to those with a favorable beneÔ¨Åt-to-harm ratio for thromboprophylaxis. VTE is strongly heritable, and during the last decades, several prothrombotic genotypes associated with VTE-risk have been identiÔ¨Åed. However, most of these studies were conducted in non-cancer patients, and the role of prothrombotic genotypes in cancer-related VTE is scarcely studied. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the role of prothrombotic genotypes in cancer-related VTE, with particular focus on factor V Leiden, the prothrombin G20210A mutation and polymorphisms in the ABO gene. In general, many of the studies were small and performed in selected cancer populations, and they showed somewhat diverging results. Results from recent, larger, studies indicated that there is an association between these prothrombotic genotypes and cancer-related VTE. However, their predictive capability has not been assessed and the clinical implications are yet unclear. Future research should be conducted in larger cancer patient populations, and should be extended to include recently identiÔ¨Åed prothrombotic genotypes and assess the predictive value of genetic risk scores.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gran","given":"Olga V."},{"family":"Br√¶kkan","given":"Sigrid K."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"John-Bjarne"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"gran_prothrombotic_2018","container-title":"Thrombosis Research","container-title-short":"Thrombosis Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.thromres.2017.12.025","ISSN":"00493848","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"language":"en","page":"S12-S18","source":"10.407","title":"Prothrombotic genotypes and risk of venous thromboembolism in cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049384817306291","volume":"164"},

  {"id":"grever_how_2010","abstract":"Abstract\n            The description of hairy cell leukemia as a specific clinical entity was published 50 years ago. The clinical outcome for patients was hampered by ineffective chemotherapy, and splenectomy was the major therapeutic approach to improve peripheral blood counts. The median survival after diagnosis was 4 years. With the introduction of Œ±-interferon in 1984, marked improvements in patient responses were observed. Shortly thereafter, the introduction of the purine nucleoside analogs transformed this disease into a highly treatable form of leukemia, and patients with the classic form of this rare leukemia now have a near-normal life expectancy. However, other clinical entities mimicking this disease do not respond; thus, accurate diagnosis is important. Immunophenotypic features in classic hairy cell leukemia show that the leukemic cells express CD11c, CD25, CD103, and CD123 and display bright CD20. Despite the high percentage of durable complete remissions with modern therapy, the long-term disease-free survival curves have not reached a plateau. Many patients who achieve a complete remission by morphologic criteria have minimal residual disease demonstrable by either flow cytometry or immunohistochemical staining, and this population may be at higher risk for earlier relapse. Continued clinical research is essential to optimize therapy for this disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Grever","given":"Michael R."}],"citation-key":"grever_how_2010","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2009-06-195370","ISSN":"0006-4971, 1528-0020","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,7]]},"language":"en","page":"21-28","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How I treat hairy cell leukemia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/115/1/21/26645/How-I-treat-hairy-cell-leukemia","volume":"115"},

In a large, observational, bevacizumab treatment study (Bevacizumab Regimens: Investigation of Treatment Effects and Safety [BRiTE]) in patients who had mCRC, a longer-than-expected overall survival (OS) of 25.1 months was reported. The association between various pre- and post-treatment factors (including the use of bevacizumab beyond first progression [BBP]) and survival was examined.\n\nPatients and Methods\n\nThe 1,445 of 1,953 previously untreated patients with mCRC who were enrolled in BRiTE and who experienced disease progression (PD) were classified into three groups: no post-PD treatment (n = 253), post-PD treatment without bevacizumab (no BBP; n = 531), and BBP (n = 642). Relevant baseline and on-study variables, including BBP, were analyzed with a Cox model with respect to their independent effect on survival beyond first PD.\n\nResults\n\nMedian OS was 25.1 months (95% CI, 23.4 to 27.5 months), and median progression-free survival was 10.0 months in the overall BRiTE population. Baseline and postbaseline factors were well balanced between the BBP and no-BBP groups. Median OS rates were 12.6, 19.9, and 31.8 months in the no post-PD treatment, no-BBP, and BBP groups, respectively. In multivariate analyses, compared with no BBP, BBP was strongly and independently associated with improved survival (HR, 0.48; P < .001). Hypertension that required medication was the only bevacizumab-related safety event that occurred more frequently in the BBP group (24.6% v 19.2%).\n\nConclusion\n\nThese results from a large, prospective, observational study suggest that continued vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition with bevacizumab beyond initial PD could play an important role improving the overall success of therapy for patients who have mCRC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Grothey","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Sugrue","given":"Mary M."},{"family":"Purdie","given":"David M."},{"family":"Dong","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Sargent","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Hedrick","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Kozloff","given":"Mark"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"grothey_bevacizumab_2008","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2008.16.3212","ISSN":"0732-183X","issue":"33","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",11,20]]},"page":"5326-5334","publisher":"Wolters Kluwer","source":"45.3","title":"Bevacizumab Beyond First Progression Is Associated With Prolonged Overall Survival in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Results From a Large Observational Cohort Study (BRiTE)","title-short":"Bevacizumab Beyond First Progression Is Associated With Prolonged Overall Survival in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2008.16.3212","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"guidetti_real_2019","abstract":"<jats:p>BACKGROUND. Axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel have been approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell and mediastinal Lymphoma (NHL) patients (pts). Selection of pts who can benefit the most from these novel treatments with a low risk of life-threatening toxicities is currently a matter of discussion and outside clinical trials the selection of pts is up to clinicians of the CAR T-cell team in several countries. However, based on the results and follow up of clinical trials and the US reports about real life treatment with CAR T-cells, it is emerging that an expert clinical assessment and application of some inclusion criteria could optimize the success of therapy and minimize the severity of adverse events.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>AIMS.We are conducting a single center prospective observational trial to evaluate the accessibility and feasibility of CAR T-cells treatment among the population of NHL pts potentially eligible to this therapy.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>METHODS. Since September 2018 we have prospectively registered all pts referred at our center for CART-cells eligibility evaluation either for the enrollment in clinical trials or in the contest of the expanded access program (EAP) open for enrollment since February 2019 at our Institution. We have recorded clinical data including disease characteristics, comorbidities, history and present disease status at imaging. Patients were evaluated and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria of the CAR T-cells program available at that moment and planned for treatment.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>RESULTS. Fifty-four pts with relapsed or refractory NHL potentially eligible to treatment according to EMA were recorded in 10 months. Median age was 48 yrs (range, 20 - 70). Thirty-nine pts were affected by DLBCL and 15 by PMBCL, all pts were refractory or relapsed to at least two chemotherapy regimens, median number of previous therapy was 3. Overall, among the 54 pts referred to our center only 7 pts (13%) have been enrolled in CAR T-cells programs (4 pts treated, 2 pts are waiting for infusion, one is in screening for a protocol) whereas other 11 (20%) have been considered eligible for CART-cells treatment but are still waiting for availability of treatment-slots.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>On the contrary 36 pts were considered not eligible. Seventeen pts (31%) were excluded after the first CAR T cell team visit because of rapidly progressive disease, or ECOG &gt;1 or lymphoma mass larger than 20 cm and 7 pts (13%) were excluded for comorbidities. Nine pts requiring a treatment in a short time period were shifted to other strategies (conventional or experimental) and 3 pts were lost at follow-up.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Overall 18 pts in 10 months (33%) have been considered eligible but only 7 out of 18 have been treated, remaining pts are waiting for the treatment. One third of pts have been excluded and cardiopathy, uncontrolled progressive disease and poor performance status represent the major causes for not being eligible to treatment. More criteria such as high ferritin levels, total tumor volume and active infections will delineate even better the patient population really receiving the infusion.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>CONCLUSIONS. Among all pts with relapsed and refractory NHL referred at our Center only 33% presented clinical and disease characteristics suitable for CAR T-cells treatment. Moreover, the majority of eligible pts are at the risk of becoming ineligible because of poor disease control. The time needed to plan the apheresis and the 4-5 weeks period to obtain CAR T-cells is a major obstacle to a larger applicability of this strategy, therefore exclusion of pts with large tumor mass and with rapid progressive disease is indicated. Probably, CAR T-cells treatment needs to be planned earlier in the disease course to optimize the outcome. In Italy the feasibility over the last 10 months of CAR T-cells treatment has been largely unsatisfactory and primarily limited by the lack of commercial products.

  {"id":"guisnel_behalf_2023","abstract":"<AbstractText Label=\"INTRODUCTION\">Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the best curative option for high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Unfortunately, it is still associated with a significant risk of relapse due to mechanisms of escape from the control of alloreactive T cells. Repetitive adjuvant donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), termed prophylactic DLI (proDLI), as an effective strategy in preventing relapse is still debated.</AbstractText>\n<AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\">We performed a retrospective multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of proDLI in allografted AML and MDS. We identified 56 patients treated with proDLI (DLI planned in full chimeras without any sign of disease relapse) and matched them to 167 patients in control group, (DLI performed for mixed chimerism or positive minimal residual disease) based on similar age, initial disease, cytogenetic prognosis, and conditioning intensity.</AbstractText>\n<AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">In univariate analysis, the incidence of severe aGVHD at 100 days and incidence of all grades of chronic GVHD 1 year after allo-HSCT were similar in the two groups.

  {"id":"gunderwala_mechanism_2022","abstract":"The role of BRAF in tumor initiation has been established, however, the precise mechanism of autoinhibition has only been illustrated recently by several structural studies. These structures uncovered the basis by which the regulatory domains engage in regulating the activity of BRAF kinase domain, which lead to a more complete picture of the regulation cycle of RAF kinases. Small molecule BRAF inhibitors developed specifically to target BRAFV600E have proven effective at inhibiting the most dominant BRAF mutant in melanomas, but are less potent against other BRAF mutants in RAS-driven diseases due to paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway. A variety of new generation inhibitors that do not show paradoxical activation have been developed. Alternatively, efforts have begun to develop inhibitors targeting the dimer interface of BRAF. A deeper understanding of BRAF regulation together with more diverse BRAF inhibitors will be beneficial for drug development in RAF or RASdriven cancers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gunderwala","given":"Amber"},{"family":"Cope","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhihong"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"gunderwala_mechanism_2022","container-title":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.102205","ISSN":"1367-5931","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"page":"102205","source":"7.8","title":"Mechanism and inhibition of BRAF kinase","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593122000904","volume":"71"},

  {"id":"gusenbauer_which_2020","abstract":"Rigorous evidence identification is essential for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (evidence syntheses) because the sample selection of relevant studies determines a review's outcome, validity, and explanatory power. Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science. A novel, query-based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall, and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analyzed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognize the requirements of evidence synthesis and for academic journals to reassess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gusenbauer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Haddaway","given":"Neal R."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"gusenbauer_which_2020","container-title":"Research Synthesis Methods","container-title-short":"Res.

  {"id":"gYikbuget_how_2013","abstract":"The treatment of older patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an unmet medical need. In Western countries, the population is aging, which means there will be an increasing number of older patients. However, in the past few decades, there has been little improvement in treating them, and few clinical trials specifically designed for older patients with ALL have been reported. Older patients with ALL have a significantly lower complete response rate, higher early mortality, higher relapse rate, and poorer survival compared with younger patients. This is partly explained by a higher incidence of poor prognostic factors. Most importantly, intensive chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation, both of which are successful in younger patients, is less well tolerated in older patients. For the future, the most promising approaches are optimized supportive care, targeted therapies, moderately intensified consolidation, and reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation. One of the most important challenges for physicians is to differentiate between fit and unfit older patients in order to offer both groups optimal treatment regarding toxicity and mortality risks, quality of life, and long-term outcome. Prospective trials for older patients with ALL are urgently needed.","author":[{"family":"GÁππkbuget","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"gYikbuget_how_2013","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2012-07-379016","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"1366-1375","title":"How I treat older patients with ALL","type":"article-journal","volume":"122"},

However, the clinical benefit from cMet-targeted therapy has been limited. We developed a novel cMet-targeted 'third-generation' ADC, TR1801-ADC, that was optimized at different levels including specificity, stability, toxin-linker, conjugation site, and in vivo efficacy. Our nonagonistic cMet antibody was site-specifically conjugated to the pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) toxin-linker tesirine and has picomolar activity in cancer cell lines derived from different solid tumors including lung, colorectal, and gastric cancers. The potency of our cMet ADC is independent of MET gene copy number, and its antitumor activity was high not only in high cMet-expressing cell lines but also in medium-to-low cMet cell lines (40 000-90 000 cMet/cell) in which a cMet ADC with tubulin inhibitor payload was considerably less potent. In vivo xenografts with low-medium cMet expression were also very responsive to TR1801-ADC at a single dose, while a cMet ADC using a tubulin inhibitor showed a substantially reduced efficacy. Furthermore, TR1801-ADC had excellent efficacy with significant antitumor activity in 90% of tested patient-derived xenograft models of gastric, colorectal, and head and neck cancers: 7 of 10 gastric models, 4 of 10 colorectal cancer models, and 3 of 10 head and neck cancer models showed complete tumor regression after a single-dose administration. Altogether, TR1801-ADC is a new generation cMet ADC with best-in-class preclinical efficacy and good tolerability in rats.","author":[{"family":"Gymnopoulos","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Betancourt","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Blot","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Fujita","given":"Ryo"},{"family":"Galvan","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Lieuw","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Snedden","given":"Jeanette"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Villicana","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Wojciak","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Eley"},{"family":"Pardo","given":"Raul"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Neki"},{"family":"DÔøΩ‰Ü≤ooge","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Vijayakrishnan","given":"Balakumar"},{"family":"Barry","given":"Conor S."},{"family":"Hartley","given":"John A."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Howard Philip"},{"family":"Newman","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Coronella","given":"Julia"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"gymnopoulos_tr1801adc_2019","container-title":"Molecular oncology","container-title-short":"Mol.

However, most patients develop acquired drug resistance to EGFR TKIs. HER3 is a unique pseudokinase member of the ERBB family that functions by dimerizing with other ERBB family members (EGFR and HER2) and is frequently overexpressed in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Although EGFR TKI resistance mechanisms do not lead to alterations in HER3, we hypothesized that targeting HER3 might improve efficacy of EGFR TKI. HER3-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of HER3-targeting antibody linked to a topoisomerase I inhibitor currently in clinical development. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of HER3-DXd across a series of EGFR inhibitor-resistant, patient-derived xenografts and observed it to be broadly effective in HER3-expressing cancers. We further developed a preclinical strategy to enhance the efficacy of HER3-DXd through osimertinib pre-treatment, which increased membrane expression of HER3 and led to enhanced internalization and efficacy of HER3-DXd. The combination of osimertinib and HER3-DXd may be an effective treatment approach and should be evaluated in future clinical trials in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.","author":[{"family":"Haikala","given":"Heidi M."},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"KÁππhler","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Eser","given":"Pinar O."},{"family":"Xu","given":"Man"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Teceno","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Ngo","given":"Kenneth H."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yutong"},{"family":"Ivanova","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Bertram","given":"Arrien A."},{"family":"Leeper","given":"Brittaney A"},{"family":"Chambers","given":"Emily S."},{"family":"Adeni","given":"Anika E."},{"family":"Taus","given":"Luke J."},{"family":"Kuraguchi","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Kirschmeier","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Yu","given":"C."},{"family":"Shiose","given":"Yoshinobu"},{"family":"Kamai","given":"Yasuki"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Paweletz","given":"Cloud P."},{"family":"Gokhale","given":"Prafulla C."},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"haikala_egfr_2021","container-title":"Cancer research","container-title-short":"Cancer Res.","DOI":"10.1158/0008-5472.can-21-2426","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"130-141","source":"11.2","title":"EGFR inhibition enhances the cellular uptake and antitumor-activity of the HER3 antibody drug conjugate HER3-DXd.","type":"article-journal","volume":"82"},

Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years, did not use laxatives, and had a stable opioid regimen for treatment of chronic non-cancer pain with a total daily dose averaging at least 30 mg (morphine equivalent) for at least 1 month before screening. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral naldemedine 0¬∑2 mg or matching placebo once a day for 12 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by average total daily opioid dose (30-100 mg and >100 mg equivalents of oral morphine sulphate). The primary endpoint was proportion of responders. A responder had at least three spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week with an increase from baseline of at least one SBM per week for at least 9 weeks of the 12-week treatment period including at least three of the last 4 weeks. Efficacy endpoints were analysed by intention to treat and the safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. These trials have both been completed and are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01965158 and NCT01993940.\nFINDINGS: In COMPOSE-1, 547 patients were recruited between Aug 29, 2013, and Jan 22, 2015, and were randomly assigned to receive naldemedine (n=274) or placebo (n=273). Patients for COMPOSE-2 were recruited between Nov 4, 2013, and June 9, 2015; 553 patients were randomly assigned to receive naldemedine (n=277) or placebo (n=276). Five patients were enrolled at more than one site, so were excluded from the intention-to-treat population (COMPOSE-1: one per group; COMPOSE-2: one in the naldemedine group, two from the placebo group), with intention-to-treat group sizes of 273 in the naldemedine group and 272 in the placebo group in COMPOSE-1, and 276 in the naldemedine group and 274 in the placebo group in COMPOSE-2. The proportion of responders in both trials was significantly higher with naldemedine than with placebo in COMPOSE-1 (130 responders [47¬∑6%] of 273 in the naldemedine group vs 94 responders [34¬∑6%] of 272 in the placebo group, difference 13¬∑0% [95% CI 4¬∑8-21¬∑3]; p=0¬∑002) and in COMPOSE-2 (145 [52¬∑5%] of 276 vs 92 [33¬∑6%] of 274, difference 18¬∑9% [10¬∑8-27¬∑0]; p<0¬∑0001). Incidence of adverse events with naldemedine was similar to placebo (COMPOSE-1: 132 [49%] of 271 in the naldemedine group vs 123 [45%] of 272 in the placebo group; COMPOSE-2: 136 [50%] of 271 vs 132 [48%] of 274). Treatment-related adverse events were noted in 59 (22%) of 271 patients in the naldemedine group and 45 (17%) of 272 in the placebo group in COMOPOSE-1, and in 54 (20%) of 271 patients in the naldemedine group and 31 (11%) of 274 in the placebo group of COMPOSE-2; the between-group differences were largely due to gastrointestinal disorders, which were more common with naldemedine than placebo (COMPOSE-1: 40 [15%] patients in the naldemedine group vs 18 [7%] in the placebo group; COMPOSE-2: 42 [16%] vs 20 [7%]).\nINTERPRETATION: Naldemedine treatment led to a significantly higher responder rate than did placebo and was generally well tolerated. These results support that naldemedine could be a new option for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.\nFUNDING: Shionogi & Co, Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Hale","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wild","given":"James"},{"family":"Reddy","given":"Jyotsna"},{"family":"Yamada","given":"Tadaaki"},{"family":"Arjona Ferreira","given":"Juan Camilo"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"hale_naldemedine_2017","container-title":"The Lancet.

  {"id":"hallberg_mechanistic_2013","abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is involved in the initiation and progression of many different cancer types, including lymphomas, neuroblastoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. It is clear that ALK can be activated by translocation, as well as by mutation. The ALK locus is a hotspot for activating translocation events, with 22 different translocation partners identified. The resulting ALK fusion proteins are found in a wide range of cancer types. An alternative mechanism for ALK activation is through point mutation of the ALK locus, most commonly within the kinase domain, as reported in patients with neuroblastoma and thyroid cancer.The physiological function of ALK in mammals is enigmatic, although it is clear that ALK is not required for viability, as Alk‚àí/‚àí mice are viable. The role of ALK in model systems, such as Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio, is more clearly defined in development, with ALK signalling used repeatedly in a spatially and temporally regulated manner. In both D. melanogaster and C. elegans, ALK also has genetically defined ligands.The spatial and temporal expression pattern of the different oncogenic ALK fusion proteins is determined by the fusion partners. Furthermore, although not well studied, comparisons of the different ALK fusion proteins suggest that they display differences in signalling and in transforming and tumorigenic potential.The first clinically approved drug to target ALK ‚Äî crizotinib ‚Äî is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Recent reports suggest that ALK TKIs will be useful in the treatment of other less frequently occurring ALK-positive cancer types. A number of second-generation ALK TKIs are currently in clinical trials and are able to inhibit secondary 'resistance' mutations that are found in patients treated with crizotinib.Several important issues remain to be addressed, such as cooperativity between ALK and other oncogenes and tumour suppressors, the differences in signalling output between different ALK oncogenes, the streamlined identification of ALK-positive patients in multiple cancer types, putative combinatorial drug strategies for patients and an explanation for why the ALK locus is a hotspot for translocation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hallberg","given":"Bengt"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Ruth H."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"hallberg_mechanistic_2013","container-title":"Nature Reviews Cancer","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Cancer","DOI":"10.1038/nrc3580","ISSN":"1474-1768","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10]]},"language":"en","license":"2013 Springer Nature Limited","note":"titleTranslation: ‰∫∫È°ûÁôåÁóáÁîüÁâ©Â≠∏‰∏≠ ALK ÂèóÈ´îÈÖ™ËÉ∫ÈÖ∏ÊøÄÈÖ∂ÁöÑÊ©üÂà∂Ë¶ãËß£","number":"10","page":"685-700","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"78.5","title":"Mechanistic insight into ALK receptor tyrosine kinase in human cancer biology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc3580","volume":"13"},

We aimed to evaluate camidanlumab tesirine, an anti-CD25 antibody-drug conjugate, in this patient population.\nMETHODS: This was a phase 1, dose-escalation (part 1), dose-expansion (part 2), multicentre trial done in 12 hospital sites (seven in the USA and five in the UK). Adults (‚â•18 years old) with pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, who had no therapies available to them with established clinical benefit for their disease stage were enrolled. Camidanlumab tesirine was administered intravenously (3-150 Œºg/kg) once every 3 weeks. Primary objectives were to assess dose-limiting toxicity, determine maximum tolerated dose and recommended expansion dose(s), and assess safety of camidanlumab tesirine. Safety was assessed in all treated patients; antitumour activity was assessed in patients with one or more valid baseline and post-baseline disease assessment and in those who had disease progression or died after first study-drug dose. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02432235.\nFINDINGS: Between Oct 5, 2015, and Jun 30, 2019, 133 patients were enrolled (77 [58%] had classical Hodgkin lymphoma and 56 (42%) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Median follow-up was 9¬∑2 months (IQR 4¬∑2-14¬∑3). Eight dose-limiting toxicities were reported in five (6%) of 86 patients who were evaluable; the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The recommended doses for expansion were 30 Œºg/kg and 45 Œºg/kg for patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma and 80 Œºg/kg for patients with T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. No recommended doses for expansion were defined for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

  {"id":"hasegawa_efficacy_2019","abstract":"Objectives: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive lung cancer accounts for a significant subgroup of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Approximately 4‚Äì10% of EGFR mutations in NSCLC are EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, which are reportedly associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment. NSCLC patients carrying these mutations are rarely treated with EGFR-TKIs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib plus cetuximab combination therapy in experimental NSCLC models with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Materials and methods: The EGFR mutations examined in this study were A763_Y764insFQEA, Y764_V765insHH, A767_V769dupASV, and D770_N771insNPG. Ba/F3 cells constitutively expressing wild type or mutated EGFR were used to determine the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib plus cetuximab combination therapy in vitro. To determine the efficacy of the combination therapy in vivo, female BALB/c-nu mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 million Ba/F3 cells carrying EGFR A767_V769dupASV or Y764_V765insHH.\nResults: We observed a mild but significant (P < 0.05) additive effect of the combination therapy against several EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in vitro. Regarding EGFR A767_V769dupASV and EGFR Y764_V765insHH, cetuximab and afatinib single treatment did not induce significant inhibition of tumor formation; however, afatinib plus cetuximab combination treatment induced significant (P < 0.05) tumor growth inhibition without significant body weight loss or skin rash.\nConclusion: The combination therapy induced a more potent inhibitory effect against several EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations than either therapy alone. Cetuximab can potentially increase the efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib in NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hasegawa","given":"Hanako"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Hamamoto","given":"Junko"},{"family":"Masuzawa","given":"Keita"},{"family":"Tani","given":"Tetsuo"},{"family":"Nukaga","given":"Shigenari"},{"family":"Hirano","given":"Toshiyuki"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Keigo"},{"family":"Manabe","given":"Tadashi"},{"family":"Terai","given":"Hideki"},{"family":"Ikemura","given":"Shinnosuke"},{"family":"Kawada","given":"Ichiro"},{"family":"Naoki","given":"Katsuhiko"},{"family":"Soejima","given":"Kenzo"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"hasegawa_efficacy_2019","container-title":"Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"Lung Cancer","DOI":"10.1016/j.lungcan.2018.11.039","ISSN":"01695002","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","page":"146-152","source":"5.3","title":"Efficacy of afatinib or osimertinib plus cetuximab combination therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169500218306792","volume":"127"},

  {"id":"hasserjian_diagnosis_2023","abstract":"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are neoplastic myeloid proliferations characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias. MDS is distinguished from nonneoplastic clonal myeloid proliferations by the presence of morphologic dysplasia and from acute myeloid leukemia by a blast threshold of 20%. The diagnosis of MDS can be challenging because of the myriad other causes of cytopenias: accurate diagnosis requires the integration of clinical features with bone marrow and peripheral blood morphology, immunophenotyping, and genetic testing. MDS has historically been subdivided into several subtypes by classification schemes, the most recent of which are the International Consensus Classification and World Health Organization Classification (fifth edition), both published in 2022. The aim of MDS classification is to identify entities with shared genetic underpinnings and molecular pathogenesis, and the specific subtype can inform clinical decision-making alongside prognostic risk categorization. The current MDS classification schemes incorporate morphologic features (bone marrow and blood blast percentage, degree of dysplasia, ring sideroblasts, bone marrow fibrosis, and bone marrow hypocellularity) and also recognize 3 entities defined by genetics: isolated del(5q) cytogenetic abnormality, SF3B1 mutation, and TP53 mutation. It is anticipated that with advancing understanding of the genetic basis of MDS pathogenesis, future MDS classification will be based increasingly on genetic classes. Nevertheless, morphologic features in MDS reflect the phenotypic expression of the underlying abnormal genetic pathways and will undoubtedly retain importance to inform prognosis and guide treatment.","author":[{"family":"Hasserjian","given":"Robert P"},{"family":"Germing","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Malcovati","given":"Luca"}],"citation-key":"hasserjian_diagnosis_2023","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2023020078","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"2247-2257","title":"Diagnosis and classification of myelodysplastic syndromes.","type":"article-journal","volume":"142"},

Although 60-70% of all patients can be cured by the current standard of care in the frontline setting, the majority of the remaining patients will experience treatment resistance and have a poor clinical outcome. Numerous efforts have been made to improve the efficacy of the standard regimen by, for example, dose intensification or adding novel agents. However, these results generally failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefits. Hence, understanding treatment resistance is a pressing need to optimize the outcome of those patients. In this Review, we first describe the conceptual sources of treatment resistance in DLBCL and then provide detailed and up-to-date molecular insight into the mechanisms of resistance to the current treatment options in DLBCL. We lastly highlight the potential strategies for rationally managing treatment resistance from both the preventive and interventional perspectives.","author":[{"family":"He","given":"Michael Y."},{"family":"Kridel","given":"Robert"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"he_treatment_2021","container-title":"Leukemia","container-title-short":"Leukemia","DOI":"10.1038/s41375-021-01285-3","ISSN":"1476-5551","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"2151-2165","PMID":"34017074","source":"12.883","title":"Treatment resistance in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"heather_epidemiological_2021","abstract":"Objectives The burden of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutation (Exon 20ins) in non-small cell lung cancer is not well understood. A systematic review was conducted to identify evidence on mutation frequency, prognostic impact, clinical, patient-reported, and economic outcomes associated with Exon 20ins. Materials and methods Searches were conducted in Embase and Medline and supplemented with recent conference proceedings. Included studies were not limited by intervention, geography, or publication year. Results Seventy-eight unique studies were included; 53 reporting mutation frequency, 13 prognostic impact, 36 clinical outcomes, and one humanistic burden. No economic burden data were identified. The frequency of Exon 20ins mutation ranged from 0.1% to 4% of all NSCLC cases and 1% to 12% of all EGFR mutations. Data on the prognostic impact of Exon 20ins were heterogeneous but highlighted poorer outcomes in patients with Exon 20ins mutation compared with patients with other EGFR mutations and EGFR wildtype across a wide range of therapies and treatment lines. Comparative evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of currently available therapies were limited, as were sample sizes of studies reporting on real-world effectiveness. Nine single-arm trials and 27 observational studies reported clinical outcomes for patients with Exon 20ins. Trends towards better survival and response were observed for chemotherapy compared with TKIs as first-line treatments. For subsequent treatment lines, novel targeted therapies provided encouraging preliminary responses while results for chemotherapy were less favorable. Limited safety data were reported. One conference abstract described the symptom burden for Exon 20ins patients with fatigue and pain being most common. Conclusion Findings of the systematic review show a high unmet need for safe and efficacious treatments for patients with Exon 20ins as well and need for further evidence generation to better understand the patient-level and economic impact for these patients.","author":[{"family":"Heather","given":""},{"family":"Emich","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Stapleton","given":"Naomi"},{"family":"Mahadevia","given":"P."},{"family":"Li","given":"Tracy Burnett"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"heather_epidemiological_2021","container-title":"PloS one","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0247620","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"e0247620-NA","source":"3.7","title":"Epidemiological and clinical burden of EGFR Exon 20 insertion in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic literature review.","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

However, our understanding of the metastatic process, and thus our¬†ability to prevent or eliminate metastases, remains frustratingly limited. This is largely due to the complexity of metastasis, which is a multistep process that likely differs across cancer types and is greatly influenced by many aspects of the in vivo microenvironment. In this Review, we discuss the key variables to consider when designing assays to study metastasis: which source of metastatic cancer cells to use and where to introduce them into mice to address different questions of metastasis biology. We also examine methods that are being used to interrogate specific steps of the metastatic cascade in mouse models, as well as emerging techniques that may shed new light on previously inscrutable aspects of metastasis. Finally, we explore approaches for developing and using anti-metastatic therapies, and how mouse models can be used to test them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hebert","given":"Jess D."},{"family":"Neal","given":"Joel W."},{"family":"Winslow","given":"Monte M."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"hebert_dissecting_2023","container-title":"Nature Reviews Cancer","container-title-short":"Nat.

Echocardiography in the subcostal view revealed a larger expiratory long-axis diameter (mean: 24 ¬± 3 vs. 20 ¬± 3 mm, p , 0.001) and short-axis area (mean: 5.5 ¬± 1.5 vs. 4.7 ¬± 1.4 cm2, p 5 0.014) in trained females. IVC shape (the ratio of short-axis major to minor diameters) and the relative decrease in IVC dimension with inspiration were similar for the two groups. The IVC long-axis diameter reÔ¨Çected short-axis minor diameter and was correlated to maximal oxygen uptake (r 5 0.52, p , 0.01). In summary, the results indicate that trained females have a larger IVC similar in shape and respiratory decrease in dimensions to that of untrained females. The long-axis diameter corresponded closely to short-axis minor diameter and, thus, underestimates maximal IVC diameter. (E-mail: kristofer.hedman@liu.se) √ì 2016 The Authors.

  {"id":"hedvat_evaluation_2018","abstract":"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become an attractive option for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients. However, their use is currently not recommended as first-line treatment by national guidelines due to limited data in this patient population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the practice and safety patterns of DOACs when used for VTE treatment in the oncology population. This study was a retrospective chart review of adult cancer patients treated at Hackensack University Medical Center from January 2013 to October 2015 who received dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for VTE treatment. Of 126 patients screened, 39 patients were included. Thirty-five patients received rivaroxaban and four patients received apixaban. Ten of 39 patients (26%) were not receiving a DOAC dosage consistent with the package insert. No patients experienced clinically significant bleeding, while four patients experienced a minor bleed. Four of 14 thrombocytopenic patients (29%) did not have their DOAC dose held for thrombocytopenia. All patients had their DOACs appropriately held for procedures. Increased education on dosing DOACs according to the package insert is warranted for oncology prescribers. Despite the increased risk for bleeding in cancer patients, no clinically significant bleeding events were identified in our patient cohort. This data suggests that the use of DOACs may be safe to use for VTE treatment in cancer patients and may provide foundation for larger, randomized controlled trials to determine whether DOACs should be used for VTE treatment in cancer patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedvat","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Howlett","given":"Christina"},{"family":"McCloskey","given":"James"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Ruchi"}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"hedvat_evaluation_2018","container-title":"Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis","container-title-short":"J Thromb Thrombolysis","DOI":"10.1007/s11239-018-1731-1","ISSN":"0929-5305, 1573-742X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"language":"en","page":"483-487","source":"5.221","title":"Evaluation of direct oral anticoagulants for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in the oncology population","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11239-018-1731-1","volume":"46"},

The treatment outcome of these patients is heterogeneous. This study assessed whether such clinical heterogeneity could be partially explained by the presence and characteristics of additional chromosomal abnormalities. Cytogenetic descriptions were available for 249 of 326 children with Ph+ ALL, diagnosed and treated by 10 different study groups/large single institutions from 1986 to 1996. Secondary aberrations were present in 61% of the cases. Chromosomes 9, 22, 7, 14, and 8 were most frequently abnormal. Most (93%) karyotypes were unbalanced. Three main cytogenetic subgroups were identified: no secondary aberrations, gain of a second Ph and/or >50 chromosomes, or loss of chromosome 7, 7p, and/or 9p, while other secondary aberrations were grouped as combinations of gain and loss or others. Of the three main cytogenetic subgroups, the loss group had the worst event-free survival (P=0.124) and disease-free survival (P=0.013). However, statistical significance was not maintained when adjusted for other prognostic factors and treatment. Karyotypic analysis is valuable in subsets of patients identified by molecular screening, to assess the role of additional chromosomal abnormalities and their correlation with clinical heterogeneity, with possible therapeutic implications.","author":[{"family":"Heerema","given":"Nyla A."},{"family":"Harbott","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Galimberti","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Camitta","given":"Bruce M."},{"family":"Gaynon","given":"Paul S."},{"family":"Janka-Schaub","given":"G.

  {"id":"held_rgemox_2023","abstract":"Introduction: Patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory ( R/ R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after first-line treatment who are unable to undergo consolidative high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have poor outcomes and limited treatment options. Rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) is a common immuno-chemotherapy regimen used in this setting. The objective of the open-label, phase 3, NIVEAU study (NCT03366272) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nivolumab added to R-GemOx in pts with R/ R LBCL after 1 prior line of therapy not eligible for HDCT/HSCT owing to age and/or comorbidities.Patients and Methods: Eligible pts were adults with R/R LBCL that were refractory to or had relapsed after first-line immuno-chemotherapy and who were not deemed candidates for HDCT/HSCT based on physician's assessment and at least one of the following criteria: age ‚â•65 years; age ‚â•18 years and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) score ‚â•3; or age ‚â•18 years and prior ASCT (as 1st line consolidation). Therapy consisted of 8 cycles R-GemOx (arm A) or 8 cycles of nivolumab plus R-GemOx followed by nivolumab as maintenance for up to 1 year in total or until progression or unacceptable toxicity (arm B). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) after 1 year. Major secondary endpoints were response rates, event-free- (EFS) (time to progression, relapse, death or unplanned anti-lymphoma treatment), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. The protocol specified a pre-planned interim analysis after the first 180 pts completed up to at least 1 follow-up investigation.Results: Between Jan 2018 and May 2021, 180 pts were randomized. Two pts did not receive any treatment (one withdrawn informed consent, one death) resulting in a full analysis set of n=90 (arm A) and n=88 (arm B). Median age was 76 years (range 44-87), 52% of pts were &gt;75 years of age, 37% were primary progressive after first-line therapy, 62% had IPI 3-5. Overall response (OR) and complete response (CR) rates were similar with 34% and 20% (arm A) vs. 34% and 22% (arm B), respectively. Rates of progressive disease (PD) were 53% (arm A) vs. 50% (arm B). After a median follow-up of 21 months, 1-year PFS was 28% (95%-CI: 18%-37%) in arm A vs. 20% (95%-CI: 11%-28%), (p=0.827) in arm B (Figure A). 1-year EFS was 22% (95%-CI: 13%-31%) in arm A vs. 20% (95%-CI: 11%-28%), (p=0.654) in arm B. One-year OS was 48% (95%-CI: 38%-59%) in arm A vs. 58% (95%-CI: 47%-68%), (p=0.126) in arm B. At 2 years, PFS, EFS and OS were 15% (95%-CI: 6%-24%), 13% (95%.CI: 5%-21%) and 34% (95%-CI: 22%-46%) in arm A vs. 15% (95%-CI: 7%-23%), 15% (95%-CI: 7%-23%) an 43% (95%-CI: 32%-55%) in arm B. Because of an identical PFS but a trend toward better OS for arm B, we performed an event-driven OS analysis of pts after second progression or relapse (n=70 in arm A, n= 73 in arm B). OS survival was superior in arm B vs. arm A after second progression or relapse (Log Rank p= 0.010) (Figure B). There was a small increase in number of pts with grade 3-5 AEs in arm B (arm A/arm B: thrombocytopenia 37%/39%; anemia 19%/26%; leukopenia 19%/24%; infection 15%/22%). No increase in number of pts with immune-related grade 3-5 AEs was observed except asymptomatic increase of lipase (arm A/arm B: 23%/27%), (p=0.625) and amylase (arm A/arm B: 5%/11%), (p=0.192). Most common grade 3-5 AEs during nivolumab consolidation in arm B were leukopenia 13%, peripheral neuropathy 10%, increase of lipase 8%, anemia 5% and infection 5% of pts). In total, 7 treatment-related deaths occurred (arm A/arm B: 3 (3%)/4 (5%).After this interim analysis revealed futility to demonstrate superiority for the primary endpoint, recruitment was stopped in March 2023. At that point, 270 of 310 initially intended pts had been recruited.Conclusions: In pts with R/R LBCL, the addition of nivolumab to R-GemOx followed by nivolumab maintenance is feasible without relevant additive toxicity. The addition of Nivolumab did not improve PFS of the R-GemOx regimen alone. These results demonstrate the poor prognosis of R/R transplant-ineligible pts treated with immuno-chemotherapy. However, a trend towards a better OS was observed, which allows for the hypothesis that nivolumab might enhance the efficacy of subsequent therapies. The final analysis of the study is scheduled after completion of follow-up of the last patient included as defined by the study protocol.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Held","given":"Gerhard"},{"family":"Altmann","given":"Bettina"},{"family":"Kerkhoff","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Gastinne","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Casasnovas","given":"Rene-Olivier"},{"family":"Tilly","given":"Herv√©"},{"family":"Da Silva","given":"Maria Gomes"},{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"J√∂rg"},{"family":"Tonino","given":"Sanne"},{"family":"Vigouroux","given":"St√©phane"},{"family":"Dreyling","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Safar","given":"Violaine"},{"family":"Andre","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Morschhauser","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Feugier","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Christian W."},{"family":"Dabrowska-Iwanicka","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Gaulard","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Molina","given":"Thierry Jo"},{"family":"Rosenwald","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Greil","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Jaeger","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Avigdor","given":"Abraham"},{"family":"Thurner","given":"Lorenz"},{"family":"Maurer","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"L√∂ffler","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Ziepert","given":"Marita"},{"family":"Haioun","given":"Corinne"},{"family":"Poeschel","given":"Viola"},{"family":"Houot","given":"Roch"}],"citation-key":"held_rgemox_2023","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-172951","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"Supplement 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"page":"435","source":"Silverchair","title":"R-GemOx Plus Nivolumab Vs R-GemOx As Second-Line Therapy for Large B-Cell Lymphoma in Transplant-Ineligible Patients: Interim Analysis of the Niveau Trial, an International, Randomized Phase 3 Study of the AGMT, GLA, HOVON, Lysa and PLRG","title-short":"R-GemOx Plus Nivolumab Vs R-GemOx As Second-Line Therapy for Large B-Cell Lymphoma in Transplant-Ineligible Patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2023-172951","volume":"142"},
  {"id":"hellstrom-lindberg_clinical_2023","abstract":"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) constitute a profoundly heterogeneous myeloid malignancy with a common origin in the hemopoietic stem cell compartment. Consequently, patient management and treatment are as heterogeneous. Decision-making includes identifying risk, symptoms, and options for an individual and conducting a risk-benefit analysis. The only potential cure is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and albeit the fraction of patients with MDS who undergo transplant increase over time because of better management and increased donor availability, a majority are not eligible for this intervention. Current challenges encompass to decrease the relapse risk, the main cause of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation failure. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) constitute firstline treatment for higher-risk MDSs. Combinations with other drugs as firstline treatment has, to date, not proven more efficacious than monotherapy, although combinations approved for acute myeloid leukemia, including venetoclax, are under evaluation and often used as rescue treatment. The treatment goal for lower-risk MDS is to improve cytopenia, mainly anemia, quality of life, and, possibly, overall survival. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) constitute firstline treatment for anemia and have better and more durable responses if initiated before the onset of a permanent transfusion need.

  {"id":"hellstrom-lindberg_treatment_1998","abstract":"Treatment with erythropoietin (epo) may improve the anemia of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in approximately 20% of patients. Previous studies have suggested that treatment with the combination of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and epo may increase this response rate. In the present phase II study, patients with MDS and anemia were randomized to treatment with G-CSF + epo according to one of two alternatives; arm A starting with G-CSF for 4 weeks followed by the combination for 12 weeks, and arm B starting with epo for 8 weeks followed by the combination for 10 weeks. Fifty evaluable patients (10 refractory anemia [RA], 13 refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts [RARS], and 27 refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB]) were included in the study, three were evaluable only for epo as monotherapy and 47 for the combined treatment. The overall response rate to G-CSF + epo was 38%, which is identical to that in our previous study. The response rates for patients with RA, RARS, and RAEB were 20%, 46%, and 37%, respectively. Response rates were identical in the two treatment groups indicating that an initial treatment with G-CSF was not neccessary for a response to the combination. Nine patients in arm B showed a response to the combined treatment, but only three of these responded to epo alone. This suggests a synergistic effect in vivo by G-CSF + epo. A long-term follow-up was made on 71 evaluable patients from both the present and the preceding Scandinavian study on G-CSF + epo. Median survival was 26 months, and the overall risk of leukemic transformation during a median follow-up of 43 months was 28%. Twenty patients entered long-term maintenance treatment and showed a median duration of response of 24 months.The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) was effective to predict survival, leukemic transformation, and to a lesser extent, duration of response, but had no impact on primary response rates.","author":[{"family":"Hellstr√∂m-Lindberg","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Ahlgren","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Beguin","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Carlsson","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Carneskog","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Dahl","given":"Inger Marie S."},{"family":"Dybedal","given":"Ingunn"},{"family":"Grimfors","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"Kanter-Lewensohn","given":"Lena"},{"family":"Linder","given":"Olle"},{"family":"Luthman","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"L√∂fvenberg","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Nilsson-Ehle","given":"Herman"},{"family":"Samuelsson","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Tangen","given":"Jon-Magnus"},{"family":"Winqvist","given":"Ingemar"},{"family":"√ñberg","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"√ñsterborg","given":"Anders"},{"family":"√ñst","given":"√Öke"}],"citation-key":"hellstrom-lindberg_treatment_1998","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.v92.1.68.413k23_68_75","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"68-75","title":"Treatment of Anemia in Myelodysplastic Syndromes With Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Plus Erythropoietin: Results From a Randomized Phase II Study and Long-Term Follow-Up of 71 Patients","type":"article-journal","volume":"92"},

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assessment is a sensitive, potentially prognostic tool in this setting. We assessed baseline ctDNA to identify patients with R/R DLBCL at high risk of relapse after receiving polatuzumab vedotin and bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) or BR alone. Patients were transplant ineligible and had received ‚â•1 prior line of therapy. The ctDNA assay, based on a customized panel of recurrently mutated genes in DLBCL, measured mutant molecules per mL (MMPM) at baseline and end of treatment (EOT). Endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in subgroups stratified by baseline ctDNA and log-fold change in ctDNA at EOT vs baseline. In biomarker-evaluable patients (n = 33), baseline ctDNA level correlated with serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration, number of prior therapies, stage, and International Prognostic Index (IPI). After adjusting for number of prior therapies ‚â•2, IPI score ‚â•3, and LDH above the upper limit of normal, high (greater than median) baseline ctDNA MMPM was independently prognostic for shorter PFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.18 [95% CI, 0.05-0.65]) and OS (adjusted HR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.06-0.68]). In 23 patients with baseline and EOT samples, a significantly greater decrease in ctDNA MMPM was observed in patients with complete response (CR) (n = 13) than those without CR¬†(n = 10); P = .0025.

  {"id":"hiddemann_how_2014","abstract":"Major changes have taken place within the last few years in the management of follicular lymphoma (FL) leading to substantial improvement in prognosis and overall survival. For some patients with limited disease stages I and II, radiotherapy may be associated with durable responses; however, it is unclear whether patients are cured and new approaches such as the combination of irradiation with rituximab or even single-agent rituximab need to be explored. Whereas watch and wait is the current standard for stage III and IV disease with low tumour burden, better indices are warranted to potentially select patients for whom early intervention is preferred. For advanced stages with a high tumour burden, immunochemotherapy followed by 2 years of rituximab maintenance is widely accepted as standard therapy, although re-treatment at recurrence may be an alternative option. Highly attractive new therapeutic options have recently arisen from new antibodies, and from new agents targeting oncogenic pathways such as B-cell receptor signalling pathways or inhibition of bcl 2. Furthermore, immunomodulatory drugs may add to the therapeutic armamentarium and may lead to 'chemotherapy-free' therapies in the near future. Hence, the management of FLs has become a moving target and the hope is justified that the long-term perspectives of patients suffering from the disease will be further improved in the near future.","author":[{"family":"Hiddemann","given":"W."},{"family":"Cheson","given":"B.

  {"id":"hines_immune_2023","abstract":"T cell-mediated hyperinflammatory responses, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are now well-established toxicities of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. As the field of CAR T cells advances, however, there is increasing recognition that hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-like toxicities following CAR T cell infusion are occurring broadly across patient populations and CAR T cell constructs. Importantly, these HLH-like toxicities are often not as directly associated with CRS and/or its severity as initially described. This emergent toxicity, however ill-defined, is associated with life-threatening complications, creating an urgent need for improved identification and optimal management. With the goal of improving patient outcomes and formulating a framework to characterize and study this HLH-like syndrome, we established an American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy panel composed of experts in primary and secondary HLH, pediatric and adult HLH, infectious disease, rheumatology and hematology, oncology, and cellular therapy. Through this effort, we provide an overview of the underlying biology of classical primary and secondary HLH, explore its relationship with similar manifestations following CAR T cell infusions, and propose the term ‚Äúimmune effector cell-associated HLH-like syndrome (IEC-HS)‚Äù to describe this emergent toxicity. We also delineate a framework for identifying IEC-HS and put forward a grading schema that can be used to assess severity and facilitate cross-trial comparisons. Additionally, given the critical need to optimize outcomes for patients experiencing IEC-HS, we provide insight into potential treatment approaches and strategies to optimize supportive care and delineate alternate etiologies that should be considered in a patient presenting with IEC-HS. By collectively defining IEC-HS as a hyperinflammatory toxicity, we can now embark on further study of the pathophysiology underlying this toxicity profile and make strides toward a more comprehensive assessment and treatment approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Hines","given":"Melissa R."},{"family":"Knight","given":"Tristan E."},{"family":"McNerney","given":"Kevin O."},{"family":"Leick","given":"Mark B."},{"family":"Jain","given":"Tania"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Sairah"},{"family":"Frigault","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Jain","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"William T."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Mahadeo","given":"Kris M."},{"family":"Maron","given":"Gabriela M."},{"family":"Marsh","given":"Rebecca A."},{"family":"Neelapu","given":"Sattva S."},{"family":"Nikiforow","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Ombrello","given":"Amanda K."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nirav N."},{"family":"Talleur","given":"Aimee C."},{"family":"Turicek","given":"David"},{"family":"Vatsayan","given":"Anant"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Sandy W."},{"family":"Maus","given":"Marcela V."},{"family":"Komanduri","given":"Krishna V."},{"family":"Berliner","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Henter","given":"Jan-Inge"},{"family":"Perales","given":"Miguel-Angel"},{"family":"Frey","given":"Noelle V."},{"family":"Teachey","given":"David T."},{"family":"Frank","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nirali N."}],"citation-key":"hines_immune_2023","container-title":"Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","container-title-short":"Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtct.2023.03.006","ISSN":"2666-6367","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,1]]},"page":"438.e1-438.e16","source":"3.2","title":"Immune Effector Cell-Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis-Like Syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666636723011648","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"hiret_bevacizumab_2016","abstract":"3514\n\nBackground: Second-line treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (Bev) or cetuximab (Cet) is now recognized as a standard treatment in mCRC. The main objective of this French multicenter, prospective open randomized trial was to evaluate the Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate at 4 months in patients receiving chemotherapy plus Bev or Cet after failure with Bev plus chemotherapy. Methods: The main eligibility criteria were disease progression after first-line chemotherapy: 5-FU with irinotecan or oxaliplatin associated with bevacizumab in wtKRAS mCRC. Patients were treated with cross over chemotherapy (FOLFIRI or mFOLFOX6) with bevacizumab (Arm A) or cetuximab (Arm B) until progression or limiting toxicity. The tumor response was evaluated every 6 weeks until progression using RECIST 1.1. Results: 133 patients, 86 male(64.7%), PS 0 (n = 74, 57.8%), 1 (n = 54, 42.2%), in 25 sites in France, were included between October 2010 and May 2015. Most frequent chemotherapy regimens delivered were mFOLFOX6 + Bev (n = 41) or Cet (n = 42); FOLFIRI + Bev (n = 25) or Cet (n = 25). The PFS rate at 4 months was 79% in Arm A and 66.7% in Arm B (p = 0.09). Secondary objectives included median PFS: 7.1 months (Arm A) vs 5.6 months (Arm B) (HR = 1.43; 95%CI [0.99-2.06] p = 0.06), and median OS: 15.9 months (Arm A) vs 10.6 months (Arm B) (HR = 1.44; 95%CI [0.95-2.18] p = 0.08). Conclusions: In wtKRAS mCRC patients progressing after bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, continuation beyond progression with bevacizumab and crossover chemotherapy is associated with a numerically higher but not statistically significant median PFS and OS compared to cetuximab plus chemotherapy. Final data with KRAS and NRAS analysis will be presented at the meeting.

This study evaluated the accuracy of differential-diagnosis lists generated by ChatGPT-3 for clinical vignettes with common chief complaints. General internal medicine physicians created clinical cases, correct diagnoses, and five differential diagnoses for ten common chief complaints. The rate of correct diagnosis by ChatGPT-3 within the ten differential-diagnosis lists was 28/30 (93.3%). The rate of correct diagnosis by physicians was still superior to that by ChatGPT-3 within the five differential-diagnosis lists (98.3% vs. 83.3%, p = 0.03). The rate of correct diagnosis by physicians was also superior to that by ChatGPT-3 in the top diagnosis (53.3% vs. 93.3%, p < 0.001). The rate of consistent differential diagnoses among physicians within the ten differential-diagnosis lists generated by ChatGPT-3 was 62/88 (70.5%). In summary, this study demonstrates the high diagnostic accuracy of differential-diagnosis lists generated by ChatGPT-3 for clinical cases with common chief complaints. This suggests that AI chatbots such as ChatGPT-3 can generate a well-differentiated diagnosis list for common chief complaints.

  {"id":"ho_acquired_2016","abstract":"Abstract Introduction AZD9291 (osimertinib) is designed for acquired T790M mutation after first- and second-generation EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been used. Some of the resistance mechanisms that present after osimertinib treatment, including a newly acquired EGFR C797S mutation, have been identified. It is unclear, however, whether the bypass pathway is also a mechanism of resistance in patients after osimertinib treatment. Methods Cells from malignant pleural effusion were collected and cultured at the time of progression in a patient being treated with osimertinib. Tumor genotyping was done by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationÔøΩÊáÄime of flight mass spectrometry. EGFR, AKT, MEK, and ERK phosphorylation were determined. An anchorage-dependent colony formation assay was used for drug sensitivity. Results An acquired mutation, BRAF V600E, was found in the patient at the time of progression while being treated with osimertinib. Cells grown from malignant pleural effusion were sensitive to BRAF V600E inhibitor and were more vulnerable to a combination treatment with osimertinib. Conclusions A potential mechanism of acquired resistance to osimertinib in patients with T790M is through the BRAF pathway. Simultaneous blockade of the BRAF and EGFR had a significant inhibitory effect.","author":[{"family":"Ho","given":"Chao-Chi"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Wei-Yu"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Chih-An"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Jin-Yuan"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Chong-Jen"},{"family":"Yang","given":"James Chih-Hsin"}],"citation-key":"ho_acquired_2016","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"hochhaus_treatment_2023","abstract":"Background: The TIGER-trial (NCT01657604) is a multicenter, randomized phase III study to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of nilotinib (NIL) vs NIL+pegylated interferon alpha2b (IFN) combination therapy with IFN maintenance as first-line treatment for patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. Methods: A total of 717 pts were recruited from 110 sites in Germany, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. A pilot phase (n=25) validated the feasibility of the combination of NIL 300 mg BID and IFN (30-50¬µg/week according to tolerability and commenced after ‚â•6 weeks NIL monotherapy). In the main phase, 692 pts were randomly assigned to NIL (n=353) and NIL/IFN (n=339). Achievement of major molecular remission (MMR, BCR::ABL1 ‚â§0.1% on the International Scale, IS) after >24 months (mo) of therapy was the trigger to start the maintenance phase; treatment-free remission (TFR) started in pts with ‚â•12 mo persistence of MR 4 ( BCR::ABL1 ‚â§0.01% IS) after >36 mo total therapy. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CML24 questionnaires. Results: From 692 randomized pts, 411 were male (59%), median age was 51 years (range, 18-85). In the monotherapy arm, median treatment duration with NIL was 3.1 years (0.02-8.9), median daily dose 600 mg (183-764). In the combination arm, median treatment duration with NIL was 2.3 years (0.02-9.1), median daily dose 600 mg (106-792). Median duration of IFN therapy was 2.4 years (0-9.0). A median of 77 (0-485) IFN injections were administered, the median dose of IFN per injection was 30¬µg (0-50). Probabilities of MMR and MR 4.5 ( BCR::ABL1 ‚â§0.0032% IS, Fig 1) by 24 mo were 89% (95% CI: 85-92%) and 49% (44-55%) vs 93% (89-95%) and 64% (59-69%) with NIL vs NIL/IFN, respectively. In 356 pts (53%) qualifying for the discontinuation phase (NIL, n=197; NIL/IFN, n=159), probabilities of maintained MMR by 24 mo were 53% (45-60%) and 62% (54-70%) after NIL and NIL/IFN, respectively, in an intention-to-treat-analysis (p=0.13). 273 (40%) eligible pts actually discontinued therapy (per-protocol-analysis, NIL, n=163; NIL/IFN, n=110). Probabilities of TFR by 24 mo were 53% (45-61%) vs 59% (49-68%) for NIL and NIL/IFN, respectively (Fig 2). Fifteen pts (2.2%) with atypical BCR::ABL1 transcripts (e1a2, n=7; e19a2, n=4; e8a2, n=2; e13a3 and e14a3, n=1 each) were randomized to receive NIL (n=7) or NIL/IFN (n=8). After a median treatment period of 37 mo (36-39) 9 pts achieved and maintained a BCR::ABL1 reduction of at least 4 orders of magnitude and were eligible for TFR. 6 pts failed to achieve an individual transcript decline by at least 3 logs. TFR was commenced in 7 and maintained in 6 pts after 32 (range, 20-84) mo. Adverse events of special interest grades 3-5 were arterio-vascular disorders in 9 vs 8%, fatigue in 2 vs 4%, thrombocytopenia in 8 vs 8%, and alanine aminotransferase elevation in 4 vs 9% of pts in the NIL vs NIL/IFN arms, respectively. QoL analyses revealed the perception of a decreased cognitive function and higher rates of fatigue in pts in the NIL/IFN arm, particularly in pts older than 40 years. In total, 24 pts (NIL, n=13; NIL/IFN, n=11) progressed to advanced disease. By 8 years, progression-free survival was 94% (95% CI: 90-96%) and 92% (88-95%), overall survival 95% (92-97%) and 94% (91-97%) in the NIL and NIL/IFN arms, respectively. 28 pts (3.9%) received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 14 after disease progression. 35 pts died (NIL, n=18; NIL/IFN, n=17), 9 related to CML. Conclusions: Survival of CML pts has reached probabilities close to normal. The combination of NIL with IFN is associated with a higher rate of molecular responses but also impaired tolerability. IFN maintenance is feasible, and resulted in a trend towards higher rates of long-term TFR. The study was conducted on behalf of the German CML Study Group in cooperation with the East German Study Group on Hematology and Oncology (OSHO) and the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hochhaus","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Burchert","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Saussele","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Baerlocher","given":"Gabriela M"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Ji≈ô√≠"},{"family":"Br√ºmmendorf","given":"Tim H."},{"family":"La Ros√©e","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Heim","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Stefan W."},{"family":"Coutre","given":"Philipp","non-dropping-particle":"le"},{"family":"Rinke","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Thoralf"},{"family":"Fabarius","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Lorch","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Hanel","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Stegelmann","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Franke","given":"Georg-Nikolaus"},{"family":"Radsak","given":"Markus P."},{"family":"Kunzmann","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Zackova","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Himsel","given":"Danny"},{"family":"Kohn","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Hehlmann","given":"R√ºdiger"},{"family":"Fabisch","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Ernst","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Pfirrmann","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"hochhaus_treatment_2023","collection-title":"65th ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-182792","ISSN":"0006-4971","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"page":"446","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Treatment Free Remission after Nilotinib Plus Peg-Interferon Alpha Induction and Peg-Interferon Alpha Maintenance Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients; The Tiger Trial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497123050504","volume":"142"},
  {"id":"hoeks_impact_2019","abstract":"Iron overload due to red blood cell (RBC) transfusions is associated with morbidity and mortality in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Many studies have suggested improved survival after iron chelation therapy (ICT), but valid data are limited. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of ICT on overall survival and hematologic improvement in lower-risk MDS patients in the European MDS registry. We compared chelated patients with a contemporary, non-chelated control group within the European MDS registry, that met the eligibility criteria for starting iron chelation. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess overall survival (OS), treating receipt of chelation as a time-varying variable. Additionally, chelated and non-chelated patients were compared using a propensity-score matched model. Of 2,200 patients, 224 received iron chelation. The hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for OS for chelated patients, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, performance status, cumulative RBC transfusions, Revised-International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), and presence of ringed sideroblasts was 0.50 (0.34-0.74). The propensity-score analysis, matched for age, sex, country, RBC transfusion intensity, ferritin level, comorbidity, performance status, and IPSS-R, and, in addition, corrected for cumulative RBC transfusions and presence of ringed sideroblasts, demonstrated a significantly improved OS for chelated patients with a hazard ratio of 0.42 (0.27-0.63) compared to non-chelated patients. Up to 39% of chelated patients reached an erythroid response. In conclusion, our results suggest that iron chelation may improve OS and hematopoiesis in transfused lower-risk MDS patients.

  {"id":"hoeks_toxic_2020","abstract":"Red blood cell transfusions (RBCT) remain the cornerstone of supportive care in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (LRMDS) [1]. Transfusion dependency in LRMDS patients is associated with inferior outcomes, mainly attributed to severe bone marrow failure [2]. However, iron toxicity, due to frequent RBCT or ineffective erythropoiesis, may be an additional negative prognostic factor [3,4,5,6]. Recently, much progress has been made in unraveling the iron metabolism. The peptide hormone hepcidin is the key regulator by inhibiting iron uptake through degradation of ferroportin, a cellular iron exporter [7]. Erythroferrone and GDF15, produced by erythroblasts, inhibit hepcidin production, which leads to increased uptake and cellular release of iron for the purpose of erythropoiesis [8]. The pathophysiology of iron metabolism in MDS is still not completely understood. Exceedingly high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are associated with iron toxicity, disease development, and progression in MDS patients [9,10,11,12]. Malondialdehyde (MDA), resulting from lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, is a biomarker of oxidative stress [10, 12]. Currently, little is known about the prognostic impact of ROS in MDS patients. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) describe iron and oxidative stress parameters over time in LRMDS patients and (2) to assess their effect on overall and progression-free survival. The EUMDS registry prospectively collects observational data on newly diagnosed LRMDS patients from 148 centers in 16 countries in Europe and Israel as of January 2008. All patients provided informed consent. Clinical data were collected at baseline and at each six-monthly follow-up visit. Serum samples were collected prospectively at each visit from 256 patients included in six participating countries. Conventional iron parameters were measured with routine assays. We additionally analyzed hepcidin, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI), labile plasma iron (LPI), and MDA. Subjects were prospectively followed until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. All iron parameters were measured centrally at the department of Laboratory Medicine of the Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Serum samples were collected just prior to transfusion in transfusion-dependent patients and stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞C. Details on the assays and reference ranges of hepcidin, GDF15, sTfR, NTBI, LPI, and MDA are provided in the supplement. The Spearman rank test was used to evaluate correlations between iron parameters. We stratified the results by transfusion dependency per visit and the presence of ring sideroblasts. When evaluating temporal changes in iron parameters, with linear quantile mixed models, we excluded patients from the timepoint they received iron chelation therapy. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from MDS diagnosis to death or, in case of progression-free survival, to date of progression or death; patients still alive at the end of follow-up were censored. Time-dependent Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves and cox proportional hazards models were used. In total, 256 consecutive patients, were included in this study. Over five six-monthly visits, 1040 samples were collected. Table 1 describes the patient characteristics. Most patients without ring sideroblasts were transfusion-independent at diagnosis (nonRS-TI; 55.9%), 18.8% with ring sideroblasts were transfusion-independent (RS-TI), 18.4% without ring sideroblasts were transfusion-dependent (nonRS-TD), and 7% with ring sideroblasts were transfusion-dependent patients (RS-TD). The median follow-up time was 6.6 years (95% CI 5.9‚Äì7.0). LPI was positively correlated with transferrin saturation (TSAT) (r = 0.15, p < 0.001, Fig. S1). LPI values increased exponentially at TSAT values above 80%. This effect was most pronounced in the transfusion-dependent groups, but also observed in the RS-TI group. MDA was weakly correlated with NTBI (r = 0.09, p = 0.069) and negatively correlated with hemoglobin level (r = ‚àí0.1, p = 0.033). GDF15 and hepcidin were negatively correlated in the RS-TI and nonRS-TD group and significantly negatively correlated in the RS-TD group (r = ‚àí0.34, p = 0.007, Fig. S2). Serum ferritin levels were elevated in all subgroups with a mean value of 858 ¬µg/L at visit 5. The highest serum ferritin levels were observed in the RS-TD group (mean value at visit 5: 2092 ¬µg/L, Table S1). Serum ferritin increased significantly per visit in the RS-TD group (beta 454.46 ¬µg/L; 95% CI 334.65‚Äì574.27), but not in the other groups (Table S2). All subgroups, except for the nonRS-TI, had elevated TSAT levels. TSAT levels were most markedly increased in the RS-TD group with a mean TSAT of 88% at visit 5 (Table S1). In both transfusion-dependent groups the median increase per visit was significant (Table S2). LPI was elevated in the RS-TD group exclusively with a mean value of 0.59 ¬µmol/L at visit 5 (Table S1). NTBI was elevated in all subgroups, with the highest values in the RS-TD group (Table S1). The increase in median NTBI level was significant in both transfusion-dependent groups (Table S2). Hepcidin levels were markedly elevated in the nonRS-TD group. Interestingly, hepcidin levels were lower in the RS-TD group, probably reflecting ineffective erythropoiesis, likewise supported by lower hepcidin/ferritin ratios in RS groups (Table S1). Median hepcidin levels increased over time in the transfusion-dependent subgroups only (Table S2). GDF15 levels, analyzed in the light of its potential role in hepcidin suppression, were increased in all subgroups (Table S1). The RS subgroups had higher GDF15 levels compared to the nonRS groups, reflecting increased erythropoiesis.

In the capecitabine and 5-FU/LV groups, median times to disease progression were 4.3 and 4.7 months (log-rank P = .72), median times to treatment failure were 4.1 and 3.1 months (P = .19), and median overall survival times were 12.5 and 13.3 months (P = .974), respectively. Capecitabine, compared with bolus 5-FU/LV treatment, produced a significantly lower incidence (P < .0002) of diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, and alopecia. Patients treated with capecitabine also displayed lower incidences of grade 3/4 stomatitis and grade 3/4 neutropenia (P < .0001) leading to significantly less neutropenic fever/sepsis. Grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (P < .00001) and grade 3/4 hyperbilirubinemia were the only toxicities more frequently associated with capecitabine than with 5-FU/LV treatment.\n            CONCLUSION: Oral capecitabine was more active than 5-FU/LV in the induction of objective tumor responses. Time to disease progression and survival were at least equivalent for capecitabine compared with the 5-FU/LV arm. Capecitabine also demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits over bolus 5-FU/LV in terms of tolerability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoff","given":"Paulo M."},{"family":"Ansari","given":"Rafat"},{"family":"Batist","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Cox","given":"John"},{"family":"Kocha","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Kuperminc","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Maroun","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Walde","given":"David"},{"family":"Weaver","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Evelyn"},{"family":"Burger","given":"Hans U."},{"family":"Osterwalder","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Alfred O."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Ralf"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"hoff_comparison_2001","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2282","ISSN":"0732-183X, 1527-7755","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",4,15]]},"language":"en","page":"2282-2292","source":"45.3","title":"Comparison of Oral Capecitabine Versus Intravenous Fluorouracil Plus Leucovorin as First-Line Treatment in 605 Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Results of a Randomized Phase III Study","title-short":"Comparison of Oral Capecitabine Versus Intravenous Fluorouracil Plus Leucovorin as First-Line Treatment in 605 Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2282","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"hong_creating_2019","abstract":"Creating shift schedules for medical residents is challenging, not only because of the large number of conflicting rules and requirements needed to ensure both adequate patient care and resident educational opportunities, but also because there is no one clear, well-defined single objective function to optimize. Instead, many factors should be taken into account when selecting the ‚Äò‚Äòbest‚Äô‚Äô schedule. In our practical experience, it is impossible for the scheduler (typically, a Chief Resident) to accurately determine weights that would allow these factors to be captured in a mathematical objective function that truly represented their preferences. We therefore propose to instead provide the Chief with a set of Pareto-dominant schedules from which to select. We present an integer programming-based approach embedded within a recursive algorithm to generate these schedules. We then present both computational results to assess the tractability of our approach and a case study, based on a real-world scheduling problem at the University of Michigan Pediatric Emergency Department, to study how a Chief Resident would evaluate the Pareto set.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hong","given":"Young-Chae"},{"family":"Cohn","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Epelman","given":"Marina A."},{"family":"Alpert","given":"Aviva"}],"citation-key":"hong_creating_2019","container-title":"Operations Research for Health Care","container-title-short":"Operations Research for Health Care","DOI":"10.1016/j.orhc.2018.08.001","ISSN":"22116923","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"100170","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Creating resident shift schedules under multiple objectives by generating and evaluating the Pareto frontier","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211692317301467","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"honigberg_bruton_2010","abstract":"Activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway contributes to the initiation and maintenance of B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. The Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is specifically required for BCR signaling as demonstrated by human and mouse mutations that disrupt Btk function and prevent B-cell maturation at steps that require a functional BCR pathway. Herein we describe a selective and irreversible Btk inhibitor, PCI-32765, that is currently under clinical development in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We have used this inhibitor to investigate the biologic effects of Btk inhibition on mature B-cell function and the progression of B cell-associated diseases in vivo. PCI-32765 blocked BCR signaling in human peripheral B cells at concentrations that did not affect T cell receptor signaling. In mice with collagen-induced arthritis, orally administered PCI-32765 reduced the level of circulating autoantibodies and completely suppressed disease. PCI-32765 also inhibited autoantibody production and the development of kidney disease in the MRL-Fas(lpr) lupus model. Occupancy of the Btk active site by PCI-32765 was monitored in vitro and in vivo using a fluorescent affinity probe for Btk. Active site occupancy of Btk was tightly correlated with the blockade of BCR signaling and in vivo efficacy. Finally, PCI-32765 induced objective clinical responses in dogs with spontaneous B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These findings support Btk inhibition as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of human diseases associated with activation of the BCR pathway.","author":[{"family":"Honigberg","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Ashley M."},{"family":"Sirisawad","given":"Mint"},{"family":"Verner","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Loury","given":"David"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Betty Y."},{"family":"Li","given":"Shyr"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Zhengying"},{"family":"Thamm","given":"Douglas H."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Buggy","given":"Joseph J."}],"citation-key":"honigberg_bruton_2010","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"hrustanovic_rasmapk_2015","abstract":"One strategy for combating cancer-drug resistance is to deploy rational polytherapy up front that suppresses the survival and emergence of resistant tumor cells. Here we demonstrate in models of lung adenocarcinoma harboring the oncogenic fusion of ALK and EML4 that the GTPase RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but not other known ALK effectors, is required for tumor-cell survival. EML4-ALK activated RAS-MAPK signaling by engaging all three major RAS isoforms through the HELP domain of EML4. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway via either a gain in the number of copies of the gene encoding wild-type K-RAS (KRAS(WT)) or decreased expression of the MAPK phosphatase DUSP6 promoted resistance to ALK inhibitors in vitro, and each was associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors in individuals with EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Upfront inhibition of both ALK and the kinase MEK enhanced both the magnitude and duration of the initial response in preclinical models of EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma. Our findings identify RAS-MAPK dependence as a hallmark of EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma and provide a rationale for the upfront inhibition of both ALK and MEK to forestall resistance and improve patient outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Hrustanovic","given":"Gorjan"},{"family":"Olivas","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Pazarentzos","given":"Evangelos"},{"family":"Tulpule","given":"Asmin"},{"family":"Asthana","given":"Saurabh"},{"family":"Blakely","given":"Collin M."},{"family":"Okimoto","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Luping"},{"family":"Neel","given":"Dana S."},{"family":"Sabnis","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Flanagan","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Elton"},{"family":"Varella-Garcia","given":"Marileila"},{"family":"Aisner","given":"Dara L."},{"family":"Vaishnavi","given":"Aria"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"Collisson","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Ichihara","given":"Eiki"},{"family":"Mack","given":"Philip C."},{"family":"Lovly","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Karachaliou","given":"Niki"},{"family":"Rosell","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Riess","given":"Jonathan W."},{"family":"Doebele","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Bivona","given":"Trever G."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"hrustanovic_rasmapk_2015","container-title":"Nature medicine","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"hsu_exon_2019","abstract":"Abstract Introduction Osimertinib is the current recommended treatment for EGFR T790MÔøΩ¢ñØositive NSCLC after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. However, resistance to osimertinib therapy is inevitably acquired after a period of effective treatment. We had a patient with EGFR L858R/T790MÔøΩ¢ñØositive NSCLC who initially responded to osimertinib therapy but eventually experienced development of resistance. Plasma cellÔøΩ°úªree DNA analysis revealed the occurrence of exon 16ÔøΩ¶Ω≥kipping HER2, which may have resulted in the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene (HER2) splice variant HER2D16. HER2D16 has never been reported in lung cancer, and HER2D16-driven signaling is known to be regulated by Src kinase in breast cancer. We investigated the role of HER2D16 as an osimertinib-resistant mechanism. Methods We constructed and established H1975 cells stably expressing HER2D16. The dimeric formation of HER2D16 was tested by using nonreducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The effects of the study drugs on signaling transduction were examined by using Western blot. Synergistic effect was assessed by using the Chou-Talalay method. Results We found that HER2D16 can form a homodimer in NSCLC cells. HER2D16-expressing H1975 cells were resistant to osimertinib treatment. We also found that mutant EGFR and HER2D16 cooperated to activate downstream signaling for osimertinib resistance. In addition, cotreatment with osimertinib and an Src kinase inhibitor failed to reverse resistance, indicating that HER2D16-driven signaling in NSCLC did not occur through a canonical pathway. Finally, we revealed that the combination of osimertinib with the pan-HER small-molecule inhibitor afatinib could synergistically repress cell growth and signaling in H1975-HER2D16 cells. Conclusion HER2D16 can contribute to osimertinib resistance through an Src-independent pathway. HER2D16 should be included in the molecular diagnosis panel for lung cancer.","author":[{"family":"Hsu","given":"Chia Chi"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Bin-Chi"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Wei-Yu"},{"family":"Markovets","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Stetson","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Thress","given":"Kenneth S."},{"family":"Yang","given":"James Chih-Hsin"}],"citation-key":"hsu_exon_2019","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

Patients and Methods: This meta-analysis included randomized trials comparing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies with chemotherapy. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS) for the trial population and prespecified subgroups were extracted. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment efficacy using the fixed-effects or random-effects model when appropriate. All statistical tests were two sided. Results: Seven trials involving 3871 patients were included. The pooled results showed that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy significantly prolonged OS (HR: 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.84) and PFS (HR: 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.99) compared to chemotherapy. OS benefit from immunotherapy were observed in all PD-L1 expression subgroups (negative: HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.93; weak-positive: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; strong-positive: HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.78). Strong-positive PD-L1 expression showed a trend towards more benefit compared to weak-positive PD-L1 expression (interaction P = 0.08). KRAS mutant (HR: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.93), EGFR wild-type (HR: 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.87) and smoker (HR: 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.83) subgroups achieved significant OS benefit from immunotherapy compared to corresponding subgroups. Survival benefit to immunotherapy was not significantly associated with histology, CNS metastases, age, gender and performance status. Conclusion: This study confirmed that treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 improves overall survival compared with chemotherapy. Benefit was seen, regardless of PD-L1 expression levels; however, PD-L1 strong-positive patients trended to have greatest benefit. Patients with a KRAS mutant or EGFR wild-type tumor have improved survival benefit from immunotherapy compared with KRAS wild-type or EGFR mutant NSCLC, respectively.","author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Qingyuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Hai","given":"Josephine"},{"family":"Socinski","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Lim","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Haiquan"},{"family":"Stebbing","given":"Justin"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"huang_impact_2018","container-title":"Oncoimmunology","DOI":"10.1080/2162402x.2017.1396403","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"00-00","source":"7.2","title":"Impact of PD-L1 expression, driver mutations and clinical characteristics on survival after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy versus chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis of randomized trials","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Patients and Methods A total of 787 evaluable patients (B/T lineage, 525 and 262, respectively; median age, 36.1 years) were randomly assigned to receive a standard dose of cyclophosphamide or hyper-C during first induction and late intensification. Compliance with chemotherapy was assessed by median doses actually received during each treatment phase by patients potentially exposed to the full planned doses. Results Overall complete remission (CR) rate was 91.9%. With a median follow-up of 5.2 years, the 5-year rate of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was 52.2% (95% CI, 48.5% to 55.7%) and 58.5% (95% CI, 54.8% to 61.9%), respectively. Randomization to the hyper-C arm did not increase the CR rate or prolong EFS or OS. As a result of worse treatment tolerance, advanced age continuously affected CR rate, EFS, and OS, with 55 years as the best age cutoff. At 5 years, EFS was 55.7% (95% CI, 51.8% to 59.4%) for patients younger than 55 years of age versus 25.8% (95% CI, 19.9% to 35.6%) in older patients (hazard ratio, 2.16; P < .001). Patients ‚â• 55 years of age, in whom a lower compliance to the whole planned chemotherapy was observed, benefited significantly from hyper-C, whereas younger patients did not.

Thus, the aim of the present phase II study was to test a pediatric-inspired treatment, including intensified doses of nonmyelotoxic drugs, such as prednisone, vincristine, or l-asparaginase, in adult patients with ALL up to the age of 60 years.\n            \n            \n              Patients and Methods\n              Between 2003 and 2005, 225 adult patients (median age, 31 years; range, 15 to 60 years) with Philadelphia chromosome‚Äìnegative ALL were enrolled onto the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 2003 protocol, which included several pediatric options. Some adult options, such as allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for patients with high-risk ALL, were nevertheless retained. Results were retrospectively compared with the historical France-Belgium Group for Lymphoblastic Acute Leukemia in Adults 94 (LALA-94) trial experience in 712 patients age 15 to 55 years.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Complete remission rate was 93.5%. At 42 months, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 55% (95% CI, 48% to 52%) and 60% (95% CI, 53% to 66%), respectively. Age remained an important bad prognostic factor, with 45 years of age as best cutoff. In older versus younger patients, there was a higher cumulative incidence of chemotherapy-related deaths (23% v 5%, respectively; P < .001) and deaths in first CR (22% v 5%, respectively; P < .001), whereas the incidence of relapse remained stable (30% v 32%, respectively).

  {"id":"hui_cell_2017","abstract":"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is a coinhibitory receptor that suppresses T cell activation and is an important cancer immunotherapy target. Upon activation by its ligand PD-L1, PD-1 is thought to suppress signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR). By titrating PD-1 signaling in a biochemical reconstitution system, we demonstrate that the co-receptor CD28 is strongly preferred over the TCR as a target for dephosphorylation by PD-1-recruited Shp2 phosphatase. We also show that CD28, but not the TCR, is preferentially dephosphorylated in response to PD-1 activation by PD-L1 in an intact cell system. These results reveal that PD-1 suppresses T cell function primarily by inactivating CD28 signaling, suggesting that costimulatory pathways play key roles in regulating effector T cell function and responses to anti-PD-L1/PD-1 therapy.","author":[{"family":"Hui","given":"Enfu"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Jeanne"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Su","given":"Xiaolei"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Marcus J."},{"family":"Wallweber","given":"Heidi A."},{"family":"Sasmal","given":"Dibyendu K."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jeong M."},{"family":"Mellman","given":"Ira"},{"family":"Vale","given":"Ronald D."}],"citation-key":"hui_cell_2017","container-title":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aaf1292","ISSN":"1095-9203","issue":"6332","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,31]]},"language":"en","page":"1428-1433","PMCID":"PMC6286077","PMID":"28280247","source":"PubMed","title":"T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is a primary target for PD-1-mediated inhibition","type":"article-journal","volume":"355"},

  {"id":"igor_evaluation_2017","abstract":"Abstract Introduction The reported prevalence of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene ( ALK ) rearrangement in NSCLC ranges from 2% to 7%. The primary standard diagnostic method is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Recently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) has also proved to be a reproducible and sensitive technique. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has also been advocated, and most recently, the advent of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) for ALK and other fusions has become possible. This study compares anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) evaluation with all four techniques in resected NSCLC from the large European Thoracic Oncology Platform Lungscape cohort. Methods A total of 96 cases from the European Thoracic Oncology Platform Lungscape iBiobank, with any ALK immunoreactivity were examined by FISH, central RT-PCR, and NGS. An H-score higher than 120 defines IHC positivity. RNA was extracted from the same formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. For RT-PCR, primers covered the most frequent ALK translocations. For NGS, the Oncomine Solid Tumour Fusion Transcript Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used. The concordance was assessed using the Cohen Â∫• coefficient (two-sided Â∏¢ ÔøΩÔøΩ 5%). Results NGS provided results for 77 of the 95 cases tested (81.1%), whereas RT-PCR provided results for 77 of 96 (80.2%). Concordance occurred in 55 cases of the 60 cases tested with all four methods (43 ALK negative and 12 ALK positive). Using ALK copositivity for IHC and FISH as the criterion standard, we derived a sensitivity for RT-PCR/NGS of 70.0%/85.0%, with a specificity of 87.1%/79.0%. When either RT-PCR or NGS was combined with IHC, the sensitivity remained the same, whereas the specificity increased to 88.7% and 83.9% respectively. Conclusion NGS evaluation with the Oncomine Solid Tumour Fusion transcript kit and RT-PCR proved to have high sensitivity and specificity, advocating their use in routine practice. For maximal sensitivity and specificity, ALK status should be assessed by using two techniques and a third one in discordant cases. We therefore propose a customizable testing algorithm. These findings significantly influence existing testing paradigms and have clear clinical and economic impact.","author":[{"family":"Igor","given":""},{"family":"Finn","given":"Stephen P."},{"family":"Zygoura","given":"Panagiota"},{"family":"Smyth","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Soltermann","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Bubendorf","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Speel","given":"Ernst-Jan M."},{"family":"Marchetti","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Nonaka","given":"Daisuke"},{"family":"Monkhorst","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Hager","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Martorell","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Sejda","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Cheney","given":"Richard"},{"family":"HernÁç∫ndez-Losa","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Verbeken","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Weder","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Savic","given":"Spasenija"},{"family":"Di Lorito","given":"Alessia"},{"family":"Navarro","given":"Atilio"},{"family":"Felip","given":"Enriqueta"},{"family":"Warth","given":"Arne"},{"family":"Baas","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Meldgaard","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Blackhall","given":"Fiona H"},{"family":"Dingemans","given":"Anne-Marie C."},{"family":"Dienemann","given":"Hendrik"},{"family":"Dziadziuszko","given":"Rafal"},{"family":"Vansteenkiste","given":"Johan"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Cathal"},{"family":"Geiger","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Sherlock","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Schageman","given":"Jeoffrey"},{"family":"Dafni","given":"Urania"},{"family":"Kammler","given":"Roswitha"},{"family":"Kerr","given":"Keith M."},{"family":"Thunnissen","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Stahel","given":"Rolf A."},{"family":"Peters","given":"Solange Letovanec"}],"citation-key":"igor_evaluation_2017","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"ilyas_cholangiocarcinoma_2023","abstract":"In the past 5 years, important advances have been made in the scientific understanding and clinical management of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The cellular immune landscape of CCA has been characterized and tumour subsets with distinct immune microenvironments have been defined using molecular approaches. Among these subsets, the identification of ‚Äòimmune-desert‚Äô tumours that are relatively devoid of immune cells emphasizes the need to consider the tumour immune microenvironment in the development of immunotherapy approaches. Progress has also made in identifying the complex heterogeneity and diverse functions of cancer-associated fibroblasts in this desmoplastic cancer. Assays measuring circulating cell-free DNA and cell-free tumour DNA are emerging as clinical tools for detection and monitoring of the disease. Molecularly targeted therapy for CCA has now become a reality, with three drugs targeting oncogenic fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2)¬†fusions and one targeting neomorphic, gain-of-function variants of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)¬†obtaining regulatory approval. By contrast, immunotherapy using immune-checkpoint inhibitors has produced disappointing results in patients with CCA, underscoring the requirement for novel immune-based treatment strategies. Finally, liver transplantation for early¬†stage intrahepatic CCA under research protocols is emerging as a viable therapeutic option in selected patients. This Review highlights and provides in-depth information on these advances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ilyas","given":"Sumera I."},{"family":"Affo","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Goyal","given":"Lipika"},{"family":"Lamarca","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Sapisochin","given":"Gonzalo"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ju Dong"},{"family":"Gores","given":"Gregory J."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"ilyas_cholangiocarcinoma_2023","container-title":"Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1038/s41571-023-00770-1","ISSN":"1759-4782","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,15]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 Springer Nature Limited","page":"1-17","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"65.011","title":"Cholangiocarcinoma ‚Äî novel biological insights and therapeutic strategies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-023-00770-1"},

Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC with disease progression following at least two previous systemic regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy (and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy if indicated); were aged 18 years or older; had a WHO performance status score of 0 or 1; and measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Key exclusion criteria included mixed small-cell lung cancer and NSCLC histology; previous exposure to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody; and any previous grade 3 or worse immune-related adverse event while receiving any immunotherapy agent. Patients in cohort 1 had EGFR+/ALK + NSCLC with at least 25%, or less than 25%, of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression. Patients in cohorts 2 and 3 had EGFRÔøΩÔøΩ/ALK ÔøΩÔøΩ NSCLC; cohort 2 included patients with at least 25%, or less than 25%, of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression, and cohort 3 included patients with at least 90% of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression. Patients received durvalumab (10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, via intravenous infusion, for up to 12 months. Retreatment was allowed for patients who benefited but then progressed after completing 12 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with increased tumour expression of PD-L1 (defined as ÔøΩÔøΩ25% of tumour cells in cohorts 1 and 2, and ÔøΩÔøΩ90% of tumour cells in cohort 3) who achieved an objective response, assessed in patients who were evaluable for response per independent central review according to RECIST version 1.1. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of durvalumab and for whom any post-dose data were available. The trial is ongoing, but is no longer open to accrual, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02087423. Findings Between Feb 25, 2014, and Dec 28, 2015, 444 patients were enrolled and received durvalumab: 111 in cohort 1, 265 in cohort 2, and 68 in cohort 3. Among patients with at least 25% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1 who were evaluable for objective response per independent central review, an objective response was achieved in 9 (12Áπö2%, 95% CI 5Áπö7ÔøΩÔøΩ21Áπö8) of 74 patients in cohort 1 and 24 (16Áπö4%, 10Áπö8ÔøΩÔøΩ23Áπö5) of 146 patients in cohort 2. In cohort 3, 21 (30Áπö9%, 20Áπö2ÔøΩÔøΩ43Áπö3) of 68 patients achieved an objective response. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 40 (9%) of 444 patients overall: six (5%) of 111 patients in cohort 1, 22 (8%) of 265 in cohort 2, and 12 (18%) of 68 in cohort 3. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were pneumonitis (four patients [1%]), elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (four [1%]), diarrhoea (three [1%]), infusion-related reaction (three [1%]), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (two [ Interpretation In patients with advanced and heavily pretreated NSCLC, the clinical activity and safety profile of durvalumab was consistent with that of other anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents. Responses were recorded in all cohorts; the proportion of patients with EGFRÔøΩÔøΩ/ALKÔøΩÔøΩ NSCLC (cohorts 2 and 3) achieving a response was higher than the proportion with EGFR+/ALK+ NSCLC (cohort 1) achieving a response. The clinical activity of durvalumab in patients with EGFR + NSCLC with ÔøΩÔøΩ25% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1 was encouraging, and further investigation of durvalumab in patients with EGFR+/ALK+ NSCLC is warranted.

  {"id":"isbell_ageadjusted_2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Older primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients have an inferior prognosis compared to younger patients because available evidence on best treatment is scarce and treatment delivery is challenging due to comorbidities and reduced performance status. High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HCT-ASCT) after high-dose methotrexate (MTX)-based immuno-chemotherapy has become an increasingly used treatment approach in eligible elderly PCNSL patients with promising feasibility and efficacy, but has not been compared with conventional chemotherapy approaches. In addition, eligibility for HCT-ASCT in elderly PCNSL is not well defined. Geriatric assessment (GA) may be helpful in selecting patients for the best individual treatment choice, but no standardized GA exists to date. A randomized controlled trial, incorporating a GA and comparing age-adapted HCT-ASCT treatment with conventional chemotherapy is needed.\nMETHODS: This open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III trial with two parallel arms will recruit 310 patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL‚Äâ>‚Äâ65 years of age in 40 centers in Germany and Austria. The primary objective is to demonstrate that intensified chemotherapy followed by consolidating HCT-ASCT is superior to conventional chemotherapy with rituximab, MTX, procarbazine (R-MP) followed by maintenance with procarbazine in terms of progression free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), (neuro-)toxicity and quality of life (QoL). GA will be conducted at specific time points during the course of the study. All patients will be treated with a pre-phase rituximab-MTX (R-MTX)¬†cycle followed by re-assessment of transplant eligibility. Patients judged transplant eligible will be randomized (1:1). Patients in arm A will be treated with 3 cycles of R-MP followed by maintenance therapy with procarbazine for 6 months. Patients in arm B will be treated with 2 cycles of MARTA (R-MTX/AraC) followed by busulfan- and thiotepa-based HCT-ASCT.\nDISCUSSION: The best treatment strategy for elderly PCNSL patients remains unknown. Treatments range from palliative to curative but more toxic therapies, and there is no standardized measure to select patients for the right treatment. This randomized controlled trial will create evidence for the best treatment strategy with the focus on developing a standardized GA to help define eligibility for an intensive treatment approach.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: German clinical trials registry DRKS00024085 registered March 29, 2023.","author":[{"family":"Isbell","given":"Lisa K."},{"family":"Uibeleisen","given":"Roswitha"},{"family":"Friedl","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Burger","given":"Elvira"},{"family":"Dopatka","given":"Tatja"},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Orban","given":"Andras"},{"family":"Lauer","given":"Eliza"},{"family":"Malenica","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Semenova","given":"Inna"},{"family":"Vreden","given":"Annika"},{"family":"Valk","given":"Elke"},{"family":"Wendler","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Neumaier","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Fricker","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"El Rabih","given":"Abed Al Hadi"},{"family":"Gloggengie√üer","given":"Cora"},{"family":"Hilbig","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Bleul","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Weis","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Gmehlin","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Backenstrass","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Wirtz","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Ihorst","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Finke","given":"J√ºrgen"},{"family":"Illerhaus","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Schorb","given":"Elisabeth"}],"citation-key":"isbell_ageadjusted_2023","container-title":"BMC Cancer","container-title-short":"BMC Cancer","DOI":"10.1186/s12885-023-11193-7","ISSN":"1471-2407","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"language":"en","page":"767","PMCID":"PMC10436648","PMID":"37596517","source":"PubMed","title":"Age-adjusted high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation or conventional chemotherapy with R-MP as first-line treatment in elderly primary CNS lymphoma patients - the randomized phase III PRIMA-CNS trial","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"jabbour_combination_2018","abstract":"Summary Background The combination of chemotherapy and ponatinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has the potential to be a new standard of care for the disease; however, long-term efficacy and safety data are needed. Our aim was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of this regimen in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in this ongoing phase 2 trial. Methods In our single-centre, phase 2, single-arm trial in the USA, adult patients with previously untreated Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were sequentially enrolled. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, a left ventricular ejection fraction above 50%, and adequate hepatic and renal function (serum bilirubin ÔøΩÔøΩ3Áπö0 mg/dL and serum creatinine ÔøΩÔøΩ3Áπö0 mg/dL, unless higher levels were believed to be due to leukaemia at the discretion of the investigator). Patients received eight cycles of 21 days, alternating between two drug combinations: hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) and high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine. Ponatinib was given orally at 45 mg per day for the first 14 days of cycle 1 then continuously at 45 mg per day for the subsequent cycles. After 37 patients were treated, the protocol was amended to reduce the dose of ponatinib to 30 mg per day at cycle 2, with further reduction to 15 mg once a complete molecular response (defined as absence of quantifiable BCR-ABL1 transcripts) was achieved. Patients in complete remission received maintenance with ponatinib daily (30 mg or 15 mg) indefinitely, and with vincristine (2 mg intravenously on day 1) and prednisone (200 mg orally on days 1ÔøΩÔøΩ5) monthly for 2 years. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01424982 , and is ongoing and still enrolling patients. Findings 76 patients with a median age of 47 years (IQR 39ÔøΩÔøΩ61) were enrolled and treated between Nov 19, 2011, and April 4, 2018. The 3-year event-free survival was 70% (95% CI 56ÔøΩÔøΩ80). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were infection (n=65, 86%), increased transaminases (n=24, 32%), increased bilirubin (n=13, 17%), pancreatitis (n=13, 17%), hypertension (n=12, 16%), bleeding (n=10, 13%), and skin rash (n=9, 12%). Six patients died while still on study treatment. Three patients (4%) died from infection and one (1%) from haemorrhage. Two patients died from myocardial infarction related to early ponatinib use; neither death occurred after protocol revision. Interpretation The combination of chemotherapy with ponatinib is effective in achieving long-term remission in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positiveÔøΩÔøΩ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This regimen could represent a new standard of care for this population. A randomised, phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy of this combination compared with chemotherapy plus earlier-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is warranted.

  {"id":"jaffe_classification_2008","abstract":"In the past 50 years, we have witnessed explosive growth in the understanding of normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells. B-cell, T-cell, and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms in many respects recapitulate normal stages of lymphoid cell differentiation and function, so that they can be to some extent classified according to the corresponding normal stage. Likewise, the molecular mechanisms involved the pathogenesis of lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias are often based on the physiology of the lymphoid cells, capitalizing on deregulated normal physiology by harnessing the promoters of genes essential for lymphocyte function. The clinical manifestations of lymphomas likewise reflect the normal function of lymphoid cells in vivo. The multiparameter approach to classification adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification has been validated in international studies as being highly reproducible, and enhancing the interpretation of clinical and translational studies. In addition, accurate and precise classification of disease entities facilitates the discovery of the molecular basis of lymphoid neoplasms in the basic science laboratory.","author":[{"family":"Jaffe","given":"Elaine S."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Nancy Lee"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Isaacson","given":"Peter G."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"jaffe_classification_2008","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2008-07-077982","ISSN":"1528-0020","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"4384-4399","PMCID":"PMC2954680","PMID":"19029456","source":"25.476","title":"Classification of lymphoid neoplasms: the microscope as a tool for disease discovery","title-short":"Classification of lymphoid neoplasms","type":"article-journal","volume":"112"},

In the ZUMA-1 trial that led to axi-cel approval, the median time between apheresis and delivery of CAR T cells to the treating facility was 17 days (Neelapu, Locke et al. NEJM 2018). Bridging therapy, defined as lymphoma therapy given between apheresis and the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, was not permitted on ZUMA-1. By contrast, the pivotal JULIET trial for tisa-cel (Schuster et al. NEJM 2019) had a median time from enrollment to infusion of 54 days and 92% of patients received bridging therapy. Whether bridging therapy affects lymphoma CAR T outcomes is unknown. Here we evaluate patients receiving bridging therapy for axi-cel in a large multicenter cohort.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Methods and Results</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The US Lymphoma CAR T Consortium includes seventeen US academic centers that contribute data from lymphoma patients treated with standard of care (SOC) CAR T-cell therapy independently of manufacturers. As of 8/31/2018, 300 patients were apheresed with intent to manufacture SOC axi-cel for LBCL. Of the 23 patients that underwent apheresis for axi-cel and did not receive it, 20 had lymphoma progression or death that precluded CAR T infusion, of which 16 received bridging therapy. In this study, we analyze the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population of 276 patients receiving CAR T infusion with a median follow up of 9 months. In this group, 146 (53%) patients received bridging therapy while 130 (47%) patients received no bridging therapy. Bridging therapy consisted of steroids alone (n = 35, 24%), chemotherapy (n = 73, 50%), radiation (n = 24, 16%), or targeted therapies (n = 14, 10%).</jats:p>\n<jats:p>At baseline, a higher proportion of patients in the bridging therapy group had an ECOG score of 2 - 4 vs. 0 - 1 (bridging 24.8%, no bridging 6.1%, p &amp;lt;0.001), IPI score of 3 -5 vs. 0 - 2 (bridging 67.6%, no bridging 34.3%, p &amp;lt;0.001), bulky disease greater than 10 cm (28.2% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.002), immunohistochemical double expression of MYC and BCL2 (42.5% vs. 24.6%, p =0.004) and would not have met all the eligibility criteria for ZUMA-1 for reasons other than bridging therapy (48.6% vs. 30.0%, p = 0.002).</jats:p>\n<jats:p>After axi-cel infusion, patients in the bridging group had similar rates of severe (grade 3 or higher) cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (8.2% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.34) and ICANS (35.2% vs. 28.2%, p = 0.25). However, the rate of ICU admission was higher in the bridging group (41.4% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.001) as was median length of hospital stay (15 vs. 14 days, p = 0.02). While data on cytopenias was not collected, use of G-CSF after CAR T therapy was higher in the bridging group (48.2% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.006).</jats:p>\n<jats:p>In terms of outcomes, in multivariate analysis correcting for confounding features, there was no statistically significant difference in overall response rate (p = 0.2), complete response rate (p = 0.19), and progression free survival (p = 0.3) between bridging and no bridging groups; but bridging therapy was associated with significantly poorer overall survival (p = 0.001) and lymphoma specific survival (p = 0.019) (figure 1.). Both death due to lymphoma (33.1% vs. 13.0%) and death due to treatment-related mortality (TRM) (6.9% vs. 1.5%) were higher in the bridging group (p &amp;lt;0.001).</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Conclusions</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Lymphoma patients receiving bridging therapy had poorer prognostic factors at baseline and after axi-cel infusion experienced decreased lymphoma-specific and overall survival compared with patients with no bridging. This inferior outcome raises the possibility that bridging therapy may identify a sub-group of lymphoma patients with a different biology, or alternatively, bridging therapy may have an effect on the host or the tumor microenvironment that may impact CAR-T efficacy. With or without bridging, 7% of patients in our series did not receive axi-cel due to lymphoma progression and/or death. In addition, there may have been patients where bridging prevented progression or death prior to axi-cel infusion. Prospective evaluation of different bridging strategies is warranted to determine if any can improve outcomes after axi-cel, and/or if they should be utilized only for patients requiring emergent disease control during the manufacture period.</jats:p>\n<jats:p />\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Jain: Kite/Gilead: Consultancy.

In this study, we compared the outcomes of adults with ETP-ALL/LBL who received treatment on frontline regimens with those of patients with other T-ALL/LBL immunophenotypic subtypes. Patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL/LBL who received frontline chemotherapy between the years 2000 and 2014 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were identified and immunophenotypically categorized into early, thymic, and mature per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification using CD1a and surface CD3 status. Patients with ETP-ALL/LBL were identified on the basis of the following immunophenotypes: CD1a‚àí, CD8‚àí, CD5‚àí (dim), and positivity for 1 or more stem cell or myeloid antigens. A total of 111 patients with T-ALL/LBL (68% T-ALL; 32% T-LBL) with adequate immunophenotype data were identified. The median age was 30 years (range, 13-79). There was no difference in the outcomes of patients based on the WHO subtypes. Nineteen patients (17%) had ETP-ALL/LBL. The complete remission rate /complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery rate in patients with ETP-ALL/LBL was significantly lower than that of non‚ÄìETP-ALL/LBL patients (73% vs 91%; P = .03).

  {"id":"jain_how_2023","abstract":"Increasing use of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has unveiled diverse toxicities warranting specific recognition and management. Cytopenias occurring after CAR-T infusion invariably manifest early (&lt;30 days), commonly are prolonged (30-90 days), and sometimes persist or occur late (&gt;90 days). Variable etiologies of these cytopenias, some of which remain incompletely understood, create clinical conundrums and uncertainties about optimal management strategies. These cytopenias may cause additional sequelae, decreased quality of life, and increased resource use. Early cytopenias are typically attributed to lymphodepletion chemotherapy, however, infections and hyperinflammatory response such as immune effector cell‚Äìassociated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome may occur. Early and prolonged cytopenias often correlate with severity of cytokine release syndrome or immune effector cell‚Äìassociated neurotoxicity syndrome. Bone marrow biopsy in patients with prolonged or late cytopenias is important to evaluate for primary disease and secondary marrow neoplasm in both pediatric and adult patients. Commonly, cytopenias resolve over time and evidence for effective interventions is often anecdotal. Treatment strategies, which are limited and require tailoring based upon likely underlying etiology, include growth factors, thrombopoietin-receptor agonist, stem cell boost, transfusion support, and abrogation of infection risk. Here we provide our approach, including workup and management strategies, for cytopenias after CAR-T.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Jain","given":"Tania"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Timothy S."},{"family":"Locke","given":"Frederick L."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"jain_how_2023","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2022017415","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,18]]},"page":"2460-2469","source":"20.3","title":"How I treat cytopenias after CAR T-cell therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2022017415","volume":"141"},

The establishment of consensus diagnostic criteria for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), alongside the steady use of both tocilizumab and corticosteroids for treatment, have been essential in facilitating the widespread use. Preemptive interventions to prevent more severe toxicities have improved safety, facilitating CAR T-cell therapy in medically frail populations and in those at high risk of severe CRS/ICANS. Nonetheless, the development of persistent or progressive CRS and ICANS remains problematic because it impairs patient outcomes and is challenging to treat. In this case-based discussion, we highlight a series of cases of CRS and/or ICANS refractory to front-line interventions. We discuss our approach to managing refractory toxicities that persist or progress beyond initial tocilizumab or corticosteroid administration, delineate risk factors for severe toxicities, highlight the emerging use of anakinra, and review mitigation strategies and supportive care measures to improve outcomes in patients who develop these refractory toxicities.","author":[{"family":"Jain","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Melody"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nirali N."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"jain_how_2023a","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2022017414","ISSN":"1528-0020","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,18]]},"language":"eng","page":"2430-2442","PMCID":"PMC10329191","PMID":"36989488","source":"20.3","title":"How I treat refractory CRS and ICANS after CAR T-cell therapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"141"},

  {"id":"jayson_ovarian_2014","abstract":"Epithelial ovarian cancer is the commonest cause of gynaecological cancer-associated death. The disease typically presents in postmenopausal women, with a few months of abdominal pain and distension. Most women have advanced disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage III), for which the standard of care remains surgery and platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although this treatment can be curative for most patients with early stage disease, most women with advanced disease will develop many episodes of recurrent disease with progressively shorter disease-free intervals. These episodes culminate in chemoresistance and ultimately bowel obstruction, the most frequent cause of death. For women whose disease continues to respond to platinum-based drugs, the disease can often be controlled for 5 years or more. Targeted treatments such as antiangiogenic drugs or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors offer potential for improved survival. The efficacy of screening, designed to detect the disease at an earlier and curable stage remains unproven, with key results expected in 2015.","author":[{"family":"Jayson","given":"Gordon C."},{"family":"Kohn","given":"Elise C."},{"family":"Kitchener","given":"Henry C."},{"family":"Ledermann","given":"Jonathan A."}],"citation-key":"jayson_ovarian_2014","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62146-7","ISSN":"1474-547X","issue":"9951","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,11]]},"language":"en","page":"1376-1388","PMID":"24767708","source":"PubMed","title":"Ovarian cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"384"},
  {"id":"jazieh_realworld_2021","abstract":"PURPOSE\nAnaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene alterations are potent oncogenic drivers in non‚Äìsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the ALK pathway are effective in treating ALK-positive NSCLC. Around 5% of Asian and White patients with NSCLC have ALK-positive tumors, but ALK rearrangement prevalence data in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are limited.\n\nMETHODS\nIn this noninterventional epidemiology study, histologically confirmed nonsquamous NSCLC samples retained for < 5 years in tissue banks at six centers in MENA were retrospectively analyzed for ALK rearrangement using the VENTANA immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. Patient characteristics obtained were analyzed for association with ALK rearrangement. Concordance between IHC and Vysis fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ALK detection methods was assessed in a subset of samples.\n\nRESULTS\nFour hundred forty-eight tissue samples were analyzed using IHC: 137 (30.6%) in Lebanon, 104 (23.2%) in Saudi Arabia, 97 (21.7%) in Egypt, 80 (17.9%) in the United Arab Emirates, and 30 (6.7%) in Morocco. On the basis of IHC, the prevalence was 8.7% (95% CI, 6.3 to 11.7) for ALK-positivity and 91.3% (95% CI, 88.3 to 93.7) for ALK-negativity. On the basis of FISH (n = 148), the prevalence was 5.4% positivity and 81.8% negativity (12.8% nonevaluable). Concordance between IHC and FISH (n = 129) was 98.4% (95% CI, 94.2 to 99.8) for negative agreement and 98.5% (95% CI, 94.5 to 99.8) for overall agreement. Univariate analysis showed that ALK rearrangement was significantly associated with epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type status (P = .03) but was not significantly associated with sex, race, smoking history, or histologic subtype.\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings suggest that ALK rearrangements are more prevalent in MENA than other geographic regions. High concordance was found between FISH and IHC. Except for epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type status, no clinicopathologic characteristics were associated with ALK-positive NSCLC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Jazieh","given":"Abdul Rahman"},{"family":"Gaafar","given":"Rabab"},{"family":"Errihani","given":"Hassan"},{"family":"Jaafar","given":"Hassan"},{"family":"Al Dayel","given":"Fouad"},{"family":"Bahnassy","given":"Abeer A."},{"family":"El Kadi","given":"Hatem"},{"family":"Abdallah","given":"Mohamed Magdy"},{"family":"Zaatari","given":"Ghazi"}],"citation-key":"jazieh_realworld_2021","container-title":"JCO Global Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO Glob Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/GO.21.00067","ISSN":"2687-8941","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,17]]},"page":"GO.21.00067","PMCID":"PMC8613346","PMID":"34788123","source":"4.5","title":"Real-World Data on the Prevalence of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase‚ÄìPositive Non‚ÄìSmall-Cell Lung Cancer in the Middle East and North Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8613346/","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"jBannne_azd9291_2015","abstract":"Background The EGFR T790M mutation is the most common mechanism of drug resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients who have lung cancer with an EGFR mutation (EGFR-mutated lung cancer). In preclinical models, the EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 has been shown to be effective against both EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitizing and T790M resistance mutations. Methods We administered AZD9291 at doses of 20 to 240 mg once daily in patients with advanced lung cancer who had radiologically documented disease progression after previous treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The study included dose-escalation cohorts and dose-expansion cohorts. In the expansion cohorts, prestudy tumor biopsies were required for central determination of EGFR T790M status. Patients were assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Results A total of 253 patients were treated. Among 31 patients enrolled in the dose-escalation cohorts, no dose-limiting toxic effects occurred at the doses evaluated. An additional 222 patients were treated in five expansion cohorts. The most common all-cause adverse events were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and decreased appetite. The overall objective tumor response rate was 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45 to 58). Among 127 patients with centrally confirmed EGFR T790M who could be evaluated for response, the response rate was 61% (95% CI, 52 to 70). In contrast, among 61 patients without centrally detectable EGFR T790M who could be evaluated for response, the response rate was 21% (95% CI, 12 to 34). The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months (95% CI, 8.3 to not reached) in EGFR T790M-positive patients and 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 4.3) in EGFR T790M-negative patients.

  {"id":"jia_overcoming_2016","abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are approved treatments for non-small cell lung cancers harbouring activating mutations in the EGFR kinase, but resistance arises rapidly, most frequently owing to the secondary T790M mutation within the ATP site of the receptor. Recently developed mutant-selective irreversible inhibitors are highly active against the T790M mutant, but their efficacy can be compromised by acquired mutation of C797, the cysteine residue with which they form a key covalent bond. All current EGFR TKIs target the ATP-site of the kinase, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with alternative mechanisms of action. Here we describe the rational discovery of EAI045, an allosteric inhibitor that targets selected drug-resistant EGFR mutants but spares the wild-type receptor. The crystal structure shows that the compound binds an allosteric site created by the displacement of the regulatory C-helix in an inactive conformation of the kinase. The compound inhibits L858R/T790M-mutant EGFR with low-nanomolar potency in biochemical assays. However, as a single agent it is not effective in blocking EGFR-driven proliferation in cells owing to differential potency on the two subunits of the dimeric receptor, which interact in an asymmetric manner in the active state. We observe marked synergy of EAI045 with cetuximab, an antibody therapeutic that blocks EGFR dimerization, rendering the kinase uniformly susceptible to the allosteric agent. EAI045 in combination with cetuximab is effective in mouse models of lung cancer driven by EGFR(L858R/T790M) and by EGFR(L858R/T790M/C797S), a mutant that is resistant to all currently available EGFR TKIs. More generally, our findings illustrate the utility of purposefully targeting allosteric sites to obtain mutant-selective inhibitors.","author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Yun","given":"Cai-Hong"},{"family":"Park","given":"Eun Young"},{"family":"Ercan","given":"Dalia"},{"family":"Manuia","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Juarez","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Chunxiao"},{"family":"Rhee","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Haikuo"},{"family":"Palakurthi","given":"Sangeetha"},{"family":"Jang","given":"Jaebong"},{"family":"Lelais","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"DiDonato","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bursulaya","given":"Badry"},{"family":"Michellys","given":"Pierre-Yves"},{"family":"Epple","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Marsilje","given":"Thomas H."},{"family":"McNeill","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Wenshuo"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Bender Steven"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Kwok-Kin"},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."},{"family":"Eck","given":"Michael J."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"jia_overcoming_2016","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature17960","issue":"7605","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"129-132","source":"64.8","title":"Overcoming EGFR(T790M) and EGFR(C797S) resistance with mutant-selective allosteric inhibitors","type":"article-journal","volume":"534"},

Pseudoprogression is a phenomenon in which an initial increase in tumor size is observed or new lesions appear, followed by a decrease in tumor burden; this phenomenon can benefit patients receiving immunotherapy but often leads to premature discontinuation of treatment owing to the false judgment of progression. Accurately recognizing pseudoprogression is also a challenge for physicians. Because of the extensive attention on pseudoprogression, significant progress has been made. Some new criteria for immunotherapy, such as irRC, iRECIST and imRECIST, were proposed to accurately evaluate the response to immunotherapy. Many new detection indexes, such as ctDNA and IL-8, have also been used to identify pseudoprogression. In this review, the definition, evaluation criteria, mechanism, monitoring, management and prognosis of pseudoprogression are summarized, and diagnostic and treatment processes for patients with progression but with a suspicion of pseudoprogression are proposed; these processes could be helpful for physicians in clinical practice and enhances the understanding of pseudoprogression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Wenxiao"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Qianqian"},{"family":"Han","given":"Anqin"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jinming"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"jia_potential_2019","container-title":"Cancer Biology & Medicine","container-title-short":"Cancer Biol Med","DOI":"10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2019.0144","ISSN":"2095-3941","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"page":"655-670","PMCID":"PMC6936240","PMID":"31908886","source":"5.5","title":"The potential mechanism, recognition and clinical significance of tumor pseudoprogression after immunotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936240/","volume":"16"},

We additionally demonstrate the benefits of pretraining with clinical text, the potential for increasing generalizability to different sites through fine-tuning and the full deployment of our system in a prospective, single-arm trial. These results show the potential for using clinical language models in medicine to read alongside physicians and provide guidance at the point of care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Lavender Yao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xujin Chris"},{"family":"Nejatian","given":"Nima Pour"},{"family":"Nasir-Moin","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Duo"},{"family":"Abidin","given":"Anas"},{"family":"Eaton","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Riina","given":"Howard Antony"},{"family":"Laufer","given":"Ilya"},{"family":"Punjabi","given":"Paawan"},{"family":"Miceli","given":"Madeline"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Nora C."},{"family":"Orillac","given":"Cordelia"},{"family":"Schnurman","given":"Zane"},{"family":"Livia","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Kurland","given":"David"},{"family":"Neifert","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Dastagirzada","given":"Yosef"},{"family":"Kondziolka","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Alexander T.

  {"id":"jin_screening_2011","abstract":"Background: The use of a standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to detect the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein in lung cancer is challenging. There are no universally accepted, evidence-based guidelines on identifying patients with ALK -rearranged lung cancer using IHC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 465 resected specimens of non-small cell lung cancer using a tissue microarray as a test set. ALK protein expression using IHC with 5A4 monoclonal antibody (Novocastra) and ALK gene rearrangement using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with dual-color break-apart probes (Abbott molecular) were examined. Immunoreactivity was scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the results were compared with the FISH results. A diagnostic algorithm was derived from the correlation of the IHC and FISH results and applied to an additional 187 adenocarcinoma samples used as a validation set. Results: In the test set, ALK protein expression was detected in 40 patients (40/465, 8.6%), consisting of IHC scores of 1 ( n = 14), 2 ( n = 10), and 3 ( n = 16), whereas 19 patients (19/453, 4.2%) were FISH-positive. All the FISH-positive patients were assigned IHC scores of 2 or 3. All the patients with ALK IHC scores of 3 were FISH-positive, those with scores of 0 or 1 were FISH-negative, and those with scores of 2 were FISH variable. In the validation set, ALK protein expression was detected in 14 patients (scores of 1, n = 2; scores of 2, n = 6; and scores of 3, n = 6), of which nine patients (9/187, 4.8%) were FISH-positive. All the patients with IHC scores of 0 or 1 were FISH-negative, and those with scores of 3 were FISH- positive. Among the patients with IHC scores of 2, three (3/6, 50%) were FISH-positive. Conclusions: The sensitivity and specificity of IHC was 100% and 95.8%, respectively. These data supported an IHC scoring algorithm in which ALK IHC scores of 0, 1, or 3 were highly compatible with FISH results, and IHC scores of 2 were variable. Based on these findings, the IHC assay using the 5A4 antibody reliably detected non-small cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement and may be useful as a screening method to identify these tumors.","author":[{"family":"Jin","given":"Ho"},{"family":"Choe","given":"Gheeyoung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hyojin"},{"family":"Choe","given":"Ji-Young"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hyun Ju"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Choon-Taek"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jong Seok"},{"family":"Jheon","given":"Sanghoon"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Jin-Haeng Paik"}],"citation-key":"jin_screening_2011","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"jingjing_concomitant_2021","abstract":"Background In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement characterizes a subgroup of patients who show sensitivity to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the prognoses of these patients are heterogeneous. A better understanding of the genomic alterations occurring in these tumors could explain the prognostic heterogeneity observed in these patients. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 96 patients with NSCLC with ALK detected by immunohistochemical staining (VENTANA anti-ALK(D5F3) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody). Cancer tissues were subjected to next-generation sequencing using a panel of 520 cancer-related genes. The genomic landscape, distribution of ALK fusion variants, and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients were evaluated. The correlations of genomic alterations with clinical outcomes were also assessed. Results Among the 96 patients with immunohistochemically identified ALK fusions, 80 (83%) were confirmed by next-generation sequencing. TP53 mutation was the most commonly co-occurring mutation with ALK rearrangement. Concomitant driver mutations [2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) G12, 1 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 19del, and 1 MET exon 14 skipping] were also observed in 4 adenocarcinomas. Echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions were identified in 95% of ALK-rearranged patients, with 16.2% of them also harboring additional non-EML4-ALK fusions. Nineteen non-EML4 translocation partners were also discovered, including 10 novel ones. Survival analyses revealed that patients concurrently harboring PIK3R2 alterations showed a trend toward shorter progression-free survival (6 vs. 13 months, P=0.064) and significantly shorter overall survival (11 vs. 32 months, P=0.004) than did PIK3R2-wild-type patients. Patients with concomitant alterations in PI3K the signaling pathway also had a shorter median overall survival than those without such alterations (23 vs. 32 months, P=0.014), whereas progression-free survival did not differ significantly. Conclusions The spectrum of ALK-fusion variants and the landscape of concomitant genomic alterations were delineated in 96 NSCLC patients. Our study also demonstrated the prognostic value of concomitant alterations in crizotinib-treated patients, which could facilitate improved stratification of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients in the selection of candidates who could optimally benefit from therapy.","author":[{"family":"Jingjing","given":""},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhenfa"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Chunhe"},{"family":"Ulivi","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Denis","given":"Marc G."},{"family":"Christopoulos","given":"Petros"},{"family":"MontprÁüáville","given":"Vincent Thomas","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Bernicker","given":"Eric H."},{"family":"Wekken","given":"Anthonie J.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Changli"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Dongsheng Li"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"jingjing_concomitant_2021","container-title":"Translational lung cancer research","container-title-short":"Transl.

Resistant patient samples revealed a variety of point mutations in the kinase domain of ALK, including the L1196M gatekeeper mutation. In addition, some patients progress due to cancer metastasis in the brain. Using structure-based drug design, lipophilic efficiency, and physical-property-based optimization, highly potent macrocyclic ALK inhibitors were prepared with good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), low propensity for p-glycoprotein 1-mediated efflux, and good passive permeability. These structurally unusual macrocyclic inhibitors were potent against wild-type ALK and clinically reported ALK kinase domain mutations. Significant synthetic challenges were overcome, utilizing novel transformations to enable the use of these macrocycles in drug discovery paradigms.

  {"id":"josting_timeintensified_2002","abstract":"BACKGROUND: An important variable affecting outcome in relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's disease (HD) is the potential of conventional salvage chemotherapy to reduce tumor volume before high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation. Currently, the optimal salvage chemotherapy regimen for these patients is unclear. Since dexamethasone/cisplatin/cytarabine (DHAP) given at 3-4 week intervals has been shown to be very effective in patients with relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we evaluated this regimen given at a median of 16-day intervals in patients with relapsed and refractory HD.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory HD were treated with two cycles of DHAP [dexamethasone 40 mg intravenously (i.v.) day 1-4, cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) i.v. as 24-h continuous infusion day 1, and cytarabine 2 g/m(2) i.v. 12q day 2]. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was given at a dose of 5 micro g/kg from day 4 until day 13. Patients with partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) after two cycles of DHAP received sequential HDCT.\nRESULTS: The median age of the 102 patients included was 34 years (range 21-64 years). Forty-two percent of the patients had late relapse, 29% early relapse, 12% multiple relapse and 16% primary progressive/refractory disease. The response rate (RR) after two cycles of DHAP was 89% (21% CR, 68% PR). The RRs for patients with late, early, multiple and progressive HD were 91%, 93%, 92% and 65%, respectively. Using the chi-square test for independence, remission status (relapsed HD versus progressive HD) and stage at relapse (stage I/II versus stage III/IV) were significant factors for response to DHAP. WHO grade 4 leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the main toxic- ities occurring in 43% (mean duration 1.1 days, range 0-6) and 48% (mean duration 1.4 days, range 0-11) of all courses, respectively. Neither severe infections nor treatment-related deaths occurred. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were collected after the first cycle DHAP in eight patients. The hematopoietic progenitors showed a very rapid increase from day 10 with a synchronous and impressive peak on day 12. A mean of 6.1 x 10(6)/kg CD34(+) cells were collected per apheresis. As originally recommended in the protocol, PBSCs were routinely collected during sequential HDCT in the remaining patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: A brief tumor-reducing program with two cycles of DHAP given in short intervals supported by G-CSF is effective and well-tolerated in patients with relapsed and refractory HD. This regimen can be used to mobilize stem cells and select those patients with chemosensitive relapse who should subsequently be treated with HDCT.","author":[{"family":"Josting","given":"A."},{"family":"Rudolph","given":"C."},{"family":"Reiser","given":"M."},{"family":"Mapara","given":"M."},{"family":"Sieber","given":"M."},{"family":"Kirchner","given":"H.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Optimal Prophylactic Method for Venous Thromboembolism After Gastrectomy in Korean Patients (PROTECTOR) randomized clinical trial was conducted between August 1, 2011, and March 31, 2015. Patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma presenting to a single center (Seoul St Mary‚Äôs Hospital in Seoul, South Korea) were enrolled. Patients were randomized to either an intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC)‚Äìonly group or an IPC+low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin sodium group. The data were analyzed on intention-to-treat and per protocol bases. Data analysis was performed from April 1, 2016, to October 30, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Venous thromboembolism incidence was the primary outcome. Postoperative complications, particularly those associated with VTE prophylaxis methods, were the secondary end point.\nRESULTS Of the 682 patients enrolled and randomized, 447 (65.5%) were male and 245 (34.5%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 57.67 (12.94) years. Among the 666 patients included in the analysis, the overall incidence of VTE was 2.1%. The incidence of VTE was statistically significantly higher in the IPC-only group compared with the IPC+LMW heparin group (3.6%; 95% CI, 2.05%-6.14% vs 0.6%; 95% CI, 0.17%-2.18%; P = .008). Among the 14 patients (2.1%) with VTE, 13 were asymptomatic and received a deep vein thrombosis diagnosis, whereas 1 patient received a symptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis. The overall incidence of bleeding complications was 5.1%. The incidence of bleeding complications was significantly higher in the IPC+LMW heparin group compared with the IPC-only group (9.1% vs 1.2%; P < .001). No cases of VTE‚Äìassociated mortality were noted.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of IPC alone is inferior to the use of IPC+LMW heparin in preventing postoperative VTE. Because LMW heparin is associated with a high bleeding risk, further study is needed to stratify the patients at high risk for perioperative development of VTE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jung","given":"Yoon Ju"},{"family":"Seo","given":"Ho Seok"},{"family":"Park","given":"Cho Hyun"},{"family":"Jeon","given":"Hae Myung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Ji-Il"},{"family":"Yim","given":"Hyeon Woo"},{"family":"Song","given":"Kyo Young"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"jung_venous_2018","container-title":"JAMA Surgery","container-title-short":"JAMA Surg","DOI":"10.1001/jamasurg.2018.2081","ISSN":"2168-6254","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"939","source":"16.681","title":"Venous Thromboembolism Incidence and Prophylaxis Use After Gastrectomy Among Korean Patients With Gastric Adenocarcinoma: The PROTECTOR Randomized Clinical Trial","title-short":"Venous Thromboembolism Incidence and Prophylaxis Use After Gastrectomy Among Korean Patients With Gastric Adenocarcinoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamasurg.2018.2081","volume":"153"},

Platelet aggregometry is applied in different clinical settings as monitoring response to antiplatelet therapies, the assessment of perioperative bleeding risk, the diagnosis of inherited bleeding disorders or in transfusion medicine. The rationale for platelet function-driven antiplatelet therapy was based on the result of several studies on patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where an association between high platelet reactivity despite P2Y12 inhibition and ischemic events as stent thrombosis or cardiovascular death was found.

However, infrequently the procedure is associated with serious injuries that are attributed to inadvertent needle penetration of the iliac bone's inner cortex. An evidence-based approach to needle orientation during iliac crest biopsy does not exist. In our study, the posterior to anterior path of the bone marrow needle from the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) was studied in human cadavers in two orientations: (1) perpendicularly to the coronal plane (the perpendicular approach) and (2) laterally toward the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) (the lateral approach). The biopsy needle was deliberately advanced through the inner ilial cortex in both approaches. Dissections and imaging studies were done to identify the relationship of the penetrating needle to internal structures. Both approaches begin with a perpendicular puncture of the outer cortex at the PSIS. The perpendicular approach proceeds anteriorly whereas in the lateral approach the needle is reoriented toward the ipsilateral ASIS before advancing. The lateral approach caused less damage to neurovascular structures and avoided the sacroiliac joint compared to the perpendicular approach. This procedure is best done in the lateral decubitus position.

  {"id":"ka_detection_2013","abstract":"Introduction The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion gene has been identified as a potent oncogenic driver in nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall-cell lung cancer, in particular adenocarcinoma (ADC). It defines a unique subgroup of lung ADC, which may be responsive to ALK inhibitors. Detection of ALK rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered to be the standard procedure, but each with its own limitation. We evaluated the practical usefulness of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect ALK expression as a reliable detection method of ALK rearrangement in lung ADC. Methods We tested 373 lung ADCs for ALK rearrangement by IHC and FISH. Multiplex RT-PCR was performed to confirm the fusion variants. Results Twenty-two of 373 lung ACs (5.9%) were positive for ALK immunoreactivity. ALK-positive tumor cells demonstrated strong and diffused granular staining in the cytoplasm. All the ALK IHC-positive cases were confirmed to harbor ALK rearrangement, either by FISH, or RT-PCR. Two cases with positive ALK protein expression, but negative for breakapart FISH signal were shown to harbor EML4-ALK variant 1 by RT-PCR. None of the ALK IHC-negative cases were FISH-positive. In addition, we identified a novel EML4-ALK fusion variant (E3:ins53A20), and its potent transformation potential has been confirmed by in vivo tumorigenicity assay. Conclusion IHC can effectively detect ALK rearrangement in lung cancer. It might provide a reliable and cost-effective diagnostic approach in routine pathologic laboratories for the identification of suitable candidates for ALK-targeted therapy.","author":[{"family":"Ka","given":"Fai"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Joanna H.M."},{"family":"Yeung","given":"S.F."},{"family":"Lung","given":"Raymond W.M."},{"family":"Law","given":"Peggy P.Y."},{"family":"Chau","given":"Shuk L."},{"family":"Kang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Carol Y.K."},{"family":"Chow","given":"Chit"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Anthony W.H."},{"family":"Leung","given":"Linda K.S."},{"family":"Mok","given":"Tony To"}],"citation-key":"ka_detection_2013","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"kale_overdiagnosis_2018","abstract":"Overdiagnosis, is defined as the diagnosis of a condition that, if unrecognized, would not cause symptoms or harm a patient during his or her lifetime, and it is increasingly acknowledged as a consequence of screening for cancer and other conditions. Because preventive care is a crucial component of primary care, which is delivered to the broad population, overdiagnosis in primary care is an important problem from a public health perspective and has far reaching implications. The scope of overdiagnosis as a result of services delivered in primary care is unclear, though overdiagnosis of indolent breast, prostate, thyroid, and lung cancers is well described and overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recognized. However, overdiagnosis is a known consequence of all screening and can be assumed to occur in many more clinical contexts. Overdiagnosis can harm patients by leading to overtreatment (with associated potential toxicities), diagnosis related anxiety or depression, and labeling, or through financial burden. Many entrenched factors facilitate overdiagnosis, including the growing use of advanced diagnostic technology, financial incentives, a medical culture that encourages greater use of tests and treatments, limitations in the evidence that obscure the understanding of diagnostic utility, use of non-beneficial screening tests, and the broadening of disease definitions. Efforts to reduce overdiagnosis are hindered by physicians‚Äô and patients‚Äô lack of awareness of the problem and by confusion about terminology, with overdiagnosis often conflated with related concepts. Clarity of terminology would facilitate physicians‚Äô understanding of the problem and the growth in evidence regarding its prevalence and downstream consequences in primary care. It is hoped that international coordination regarding diagnostic standards for disease definitions will also help minimize overdiagnosis in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kale","given":"Minal S."},{"family":"Korenstein","given":"Deborah"}],"citation-key":"kale_overdiagnosis_2018","container-title":"BMJ","container-title-short":"BMJ","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.k2820","ISSN":"0959-8138, 1756-1833","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,14]]},"language":"en","license":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

To minimize post-transplant relapse risk, involved field radiotherapy either to sites of bulky or localized residual disease has been utilized; however, the ideal timing for irradiation remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of involved field radiotherapy in the early post- transplant period.    Materials and methods  We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 24 autografted patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma who presented with bulky disease at relapse or had a persistent localized residual mass post-salvage treatment and consolidated with involved field irradiation within 4 months after autografting.    Results  No significant toxicity was noticed during the early post-radiotherapy period, while graft function was not impaired. After a median follow-up of 3 years for survivors, 21 patients are alive, 19 of whom are event-free, while 2 patients succumbed to disease recurrence and 1 to treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome. The 3-year overall, lymphoma relapse-free and event-free survival rates were 86%, 86% and 82%, respectively.

  {"id":"kamdar_lisocabtagene_2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) primary refractory to or relapsed within 12 months of first-line therapy are at high risk for poor outcomes with current standard of care, platinum-based salvage immunochemotherapy and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel), an autologous, CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has previously demonstrated efficacy and manageable safety in third-line or later LBCL. In this Article, we report a prespecified interim analysis of liso-cel versus standard of care as second-line treatment for primary refractory or early relapsed (within 12 months after response to initial therapy) LBCL.\nMETHODS: TRANSFORM is a global, phase 3 study, conducted in 47 sites in the USA, Europe, and Japan, comparing liso-cel with standard of care as second-line therapy in patients with primary refractory or early (‚â§12 months) relapsed LBCL. Adults aged 18-75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1 or less, adequate organ function, PET-positive disease per Lugano 2014 criteria, and candidates for autologous HSCT were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of interactive response technology, to liso-cel (100‚Äà√ó‚Äà106 CAR+ T cells intravenously) or standard of care. Standard of care consisted of three cycles of salvage immunochemotherapy delivered intravenously-R-DHAP (rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, two infusions of cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 on day 2, and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1), R-ICE (rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 on day 2, etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-3, and carboplatin area under the curve 5 [maximum dose of 800 mg] on day 2), or R-GDP (rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1)-followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT in responders. Primary endpoint was event-free survival, with response assessments by an independent review committee per Lugano 2014 criteria. Efficacy was assessed per intention-to-treat (ie, all randomly assigned patients) and safety in patients who received any treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03575351, and is ongoing.\nFINDINGS: Between Oct 23, 2018, and Dec 8, 2020, 232 patients were screened and 184 were assigned to the liso-cel (n=92) or standard of care (n=92) groups. At the data cutoff for this interim analysis, March 8, 2021, the median follow-up was 6¬∑2 months (IQR 4¬∑4-11¬∑5). Median event-free survival was significantly improved in the liso-cel group (10¬∑1 months [95% CI 6¬∑1-not reached]) compared with the standard-of-care group (2¬∑3 months [2¬∑2-4¬∑3]; stratified hazard ratio 0¬∑35; 95% CI 0¬∑23-0¬∑53; stratified Cox proportional hazards model one-sided p<0¬∑0001). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (74 [80%] of 92 patients in the liso-cel group vs 46 [51%] of 91 patients in the standard-of-care group), anaemia (45 [49%] vs 45 [49%]), thrombocytopenia (45 [49%] vs 58 [64%]), and prolonged cytopenia (40 [43%] vs three [3%]). Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurological events, which are associated with CAR T-cell therapy, occurred in one (1%) and four (4%) of 92 patients in the liso-cel group, respectively (no grade 4 or 5 events). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 44 (48%) patients in the liso-cel group and 44 (48%) in the standard-of-care group. No new liso-cel safety concerns were identified in the second-line setting. There were no treatment-related deaths in the liso-cel group and one treatment-related death due to sepsis in the standard-of-care group.\nINTERPRETATION: These results support liso-cel as a new second-line treatment recommendation in patients with early relapsed or refractory LBCL.\nFUNDING: Celgene, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.","author":[{"family":"Kamdar","given":"Manali"},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Scott R."},{"family":"Arnason","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Patrick B."},{"family":"Glass","given":"Bertram"},{"family":"Bachanova","given":"Veronika"},{"family":"Ibrahimi","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Mielke","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Mutsaers","given":"Pim"},{"family":"Hernandez-Ilizaliturri","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Izutsu","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Morschhauser","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Lunning","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Maloney","given":"David G."},{"family":"Crotta","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Montheard","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Previtali","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Stepan","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Ogasawara","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Mack","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Abramson","given":"Jeremy S."},{"family":"TRANSFORM","given":"Investigators"}],"citation-key":"kamdar_lisocabtagene_2022","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00662-6","ISSN":"1474-547X","issue":"10343","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,18]]},"language":"eng","page":"2294-2308","PMID":"35717989","source":"PubMed","title":"Lisocabtagene maraleucel versus standard of care with salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation as second-line treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (TRANSFORM): results from an interim analysis of an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial","title-short":"Lisocabtagene maraleucel versus standard of care with salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation as second-line treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (TRANSFORM)","type":"article-journal","volume":"399"},

Although HGSOC can potentially be responsive to immunotherapy owing to endogenous immunity at the molecular or T cell level, immunotherapy for this disease has fallen short of expectations to date. This Review proposes a working classification for HGSOC based on the presence or absence of intraepithelial T cells, and elaborates the putative mechanisms that give rise to such immunophenotypes. These differences might explain the failures of existing immunotherapies, and suggest that rational therapeutic approaches tailored to each immunophenotype might meet with improved success. In T cell-inflamed tumours, treatment could focus on mobilizing pre-existing immunity and strengthening the activation of T cells embedded in intraepithelial tumour myeloid niches. Conversely, in immune-excluded and immune-desert tumours, treatment could focus on restoring inflammation by reprogramming myeloid cells, stromal cells and vascular epithelial cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, low-dose radiotherapy, epigenetic drugs and anti-angiogenesis therapy are among the tools available to restore T cell infiltration in HGSOC tumours and could be implemented in combination with vaccines and redirected T cells.","author":[{"family":"Kandalaft","given":"Lana E."},{"family":"Dangaj Laniti","given":"Denarda"},{"family":"Coukos","given":"George"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"kandalaft_immunobiology_2022","container-title":"Nature Reviews.

  {"id":"kang_effect_2018","abstract":"Background‚ÄÇ Malignancy is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Inferior vena cava filters are a viable alternative when anticoagulation is infeasible because of the risk of bleeding. Although the current guidelines recommend that all patients with a vena cava filter be treated with anticoagulation treatment when the risk of bleeding is reduced, studies concerning the role of concomitant anticoagulation after vena cava filter insertion in high-risk patients are scarce. Since many cancer patients suffer from a high risk of hemorrhagic complications, we aimed to determine the effect of postfilter anticoagulation on mortality in patients with a malignant solid tumor.\nMethods‚ÄÇ A retrospective cohort study of patients with pulmonary embolism was performed between January 2010 and May 2016. Patients with a solid tumor and vena cava filter inserted because of pulmonary embolism were included. Using Cox proportional hazards model, the prognostic effect of clinical variables was analyzed.\nResults‚ÄÇ A total of 180 patients were analyzed, with 143 patients receiving and 37 patients not receiving post-filter anticoagulation treatment. Mortality was not significantly different between the two groups. The presence of metastatic cancer and that of pancreatobiliary cancer were significant risk factors for mortality. However, post-filter anticoagulation did not show significant effect on mortality regardless of the stage of cancer.\nConclusion‚ÄÇ In patients with cancer-associated pulmonary embolism, the effect of post-filter anticoagulation on mortality may not be critical, especially in patients with a short life expectancy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Jieun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Seon Ok"},{"family":"Oh","given":"Yeon-Mok"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sang-Do"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jae Seung"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"kang_effect_2018","container-title":"International Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Int J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1007/s10147-018-1290-7","ISSN":"1341-9625, 1437-7772","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1007-1013","source":"3.85","title":"Effect of post-filter anticoagulation on mortality in patients with cancer-associated pulmonary embolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10147-018-1290-7","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"karachaliou_bim_2015","abstract":"BIM is a proapoptotic protein that initiates apoptosis triggered by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). mTOR negatively regulates apoptosis and may influence response to EGFR TKI. We examined mRNA expression of BIM and MTOR in 57 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC from the EURTAC trial. Risk of mortality and disease progression was lower in patients with high BIM compared with low/intermediate BIM mRNA levels. Analysis of MTOR further divided patients with high BIM expression into two groups, with those having both high BIM and MTOR experiencing shorter overall and progression-free survival to erlotinib. Validation of our results was performed in an independent cohort of 19 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs. In EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with high BIM expression, concomitant high mTOR expression increased IC50 of gefitinib for cell proliferation. We next sought to analyse the signalling pattern in cell lines with strong activation of mTOR and its substrate P-S6. We showed that mTOR and phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) strongly correlate in resistant EGFR-mutant cancer cell lines. These data suggest that the combination of EGFR TKI with mTOR or PDE4 inhibitors could be adequate therapy for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with high pretreatment levels of BIM and mTOR.","author":[{"family":"Karachaliou","given":"Niki"},{"family":"Codony-Servat","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"TeixidÁ±Ä","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Pilotto","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Drozdowskyj","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Codony-Servat","given":"Carles"},{"family":"GimÁüánez-CapitÁç∫n","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Molina-Vila","given":"Miguel Angel"},{"family":"Bertran-Alamillo","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Gervais","given":"Radj"},{"family":"Massuti","given":"Bartomeu"},{"family":"Moran","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Majem","given":"Margarita"},{"family":"Felip","given":"Enriqueta"},{"family":"Carcereny","given":"Enric"},{"family":"GarcÁ©©a-Campelo","given":"Rosario"},{"family":"Viteri","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Gonzalez-Cao","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Morales-Espinosa","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Verlicchi","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Crisetti","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Chaib","given":"Imane"},{"family":"Santarpia","given":"Mariacarmela"},{"family":"Ramirez","given":"Jose Luis"},{"family":"Bosch-Barrera","given":"Joaquim"},{"family":"Cardona","given":"AndrÁüás F."},{"family":"de","given":"Marinis Filippo"},{"family":"Lopez-Vivanco","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Sanchez","given":"Jose Miguel"},{"family":"Vergnenegre","given":"Alain"},{"family":"HernÁç∫ndez","given":"JosÁüá Javier SÁç∫nchez"},{"family":"Sperduti","given":"Isabella"},{"family":"Bria","given":"Emilio"},{"family":"Rosell","given":"Rafael"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"karachaliou_bim_2015","container-title":"Scientific reports","container-title-short":"Sci.

Salvage therapy conventionally relies upon cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. A considerable number of patients experience relapse after transplantation, and further salvage management has included the use of allogeneic transplantation and radiotherapy. In the past decade, novel therapies including, brentuximab vedotin, PD-1 inhibitors, and the incorporation of PET-imaging into management have changed the paradigm of relapsed/refractory disease care. Novel therapies have been investigated in both single and combination regimens with other novel therapies and traditional chemotherapies. There is promising early work into the utility of CD30.CAR-T cell therapy, AFM13, camidanlumab tesirine, novel PD-1 inhibitors, and JAK1/JAK2 inhibition in management.

However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphateÔøΩÂºéinding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.","author":[{"family":"Katayama","given":"Ryohei"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."},{"family":"Khan","given":"Tahsin M."},{"family":"Mino-Kenudson","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Halmos","given":"Balazs"},{"family":"Jessop","given":"Nicholas A."},{"family":"Wain","given":"John C."},{"family":"Yeo","given":"Alan Tien"},{"family":"Benes","given":"Cyril H."},{"family":"Drew","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Saeh","given":"Jamal Carlos"},{"family":"Crosby","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Iafrate","given":"A.

  {"id":"kearon_natural_2003","abstract":"Most deep vein thromboses (DVTs) start in the calf, and most probably resolve spontaneously. Thrombi that remain confined to the calf rarely cause leg symptoms or symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE). The probability that calf DVT will extend to involve the proximal veins and subsequently cause PE increases with the severity of the initiating prothrombotic stimulus. Although acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) usually presents with either leg or pulmonary symptoms, most patients have thrombosis at both sites at the time of diagnosis. Proximal DVTs resolve slowly during treatment with anticoagulants, and thrombi remain detectable in half of the patients after a year. Resolution of DVT is less likely in patients with a large initial thrombus or cancer. About 10% of patients with symptomatic DVTs develop severe post-thrombotic syndrome within 5 years, and recurrent ipsilateral DVT increases this risk. About 10% of PEs are rapidly fatal, and an additional 5% cause death later, despite diagnosis and treatment. About 50% of diagnosed PEs are associated with right ventricular dysfunction, which is associated with a ‚âà5-fold greater in-hospital mortality. There is ‚âà50% resolution of PE after 1 month of treatment, and perfusion eventually returns to normal in two thirds of patients. About 5% of treated patients with PE develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of poor resolution. After a course of treatment, the risk of recurrent thrombosis is higher (ie, ‚âà10% per patient-year) in patients without reversible risk factors, in those with cancer, and in those with prothrombotic biochemical abnormalities such as antiphospholipid antibodies and homozygous factor V Leiden.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kearon","given":"Clive"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"kearon_natural_2003","container-title":"Circulation","container-title-short":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.0000078464.82671.78","ISSN":"0009-7322, 1524-4539","issue":"23_suppl_1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6,17]]},"language":"en","source":"39.918","title":"Natural History of Venous Thromboembolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.0000078464.82671.78","volume":"107"},

Although some very well validated scores delineate the risk of VTE by cancer subtype and other risk factors, hematologic malignancies are underrepresented in these models.

The overall risk of VTE in patients with leukemia depends on the use of L-asparaginase treatment, older age, comorbidities and central venous catheters. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia are at particularly high risk of VTE but also have an increased risk of bleeding.

  {"id":"kengo_kif5balk_2009","abstract":"Purpose: EML4-ALK is a transforming fusion tyrosine kinase, several isoforms of which have been identified in lung cancer. Immunohistochemical detection of EML4-ALK has proved difficult, however, likely as a result of low transcriptional activity conferred by the promoter-enhancer region of EML4 . The sensitivity of EML4-ALK detection by immunohistochemistry should be increased adequately. Experimental Design: We developed an intercalated antibody-enhanced polymer (iAEP) method that incorporates an intercalating antibody between the primary antibody to ALK and the dextran polymer-based detection reagents. Results: Our iAEP method discriminated between tumors positive or negative for EML4-ALK in a test set of specimens. Four tumors were also found to be positive for ALK in an archive of lung adenocarcinoma ( n = 130) and another 4 among fresh cases analyzed in a diagnostic laboratory. These 8 tumors were found to include 1 with EML4-ALK variant 1, 1 with variant 2, 3 with variant 3, and 2 with previously unidentified variants (designated variants 6 and 7). Inverse reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the remaining tumor harbored a novel fusion in which intron 24 of KIF5B was ligated to intron 19 of ALK . Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR analysis of additional archival tumor specimens identified another case of lung adenocarcinoma positive for KIF5B-ALK . Conclusions: The iAEP method should prove suitable for immunohistochemical screening of tumors positive for ALK or ALK fusion proteins among pathologic archives. Coupling of PCR-based detection to the iAEP method should further facilitate the rapid identification of novel ALK fusion genes such as KIF5B-ALK .","author":[{"family":"Kengo","given":""},{"family":"Choi","given":"Young Lim"},{"family":"Togashi","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Soda","given":"Manabu"},{"family":"Hatano","given":"Satoko"},{"family":"Inamura","given":"Kentaro"},{"family":"Takada","given":"Shuji"},{"family":"Ueno","given":"Toshihide"},{"family":"Yamashita","given":"Yoshihiro"},{"family":"Satoh","given":"Yukitoshi"},{"family":"Okumura","given":"Sakae"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Ishikawa","given":"Yuichi"},{"family":"Mano","given":"Hiroyuki Takeuchi"}],"citation-key":"kengo_kif5balk_2009","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

Germline predisposition is increasingly recognized in MDS presenting at older ages as well. Although each individual genetic disorder is rare, as a group, the genetic MDS disorders account for a significant subset of MDS in children and young adults. Because many patients lack overt syndromic features, genetic testing plays an important role in the diagnostic evaluation. This review provides an overview of syndromes associated with genetic predisposition to MDS, discusses implications for clinical evaluation and management, and explores scientific insights gleaned from the study of MDS predisposition syndromes.

  {"id":"khorana_cancerassociated_2022","abstract":"Cancer-associated thrombosis (including venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial events) is highly consequential for patients with cancer and is associated with worsened survival. Despite substantial improvements in cancer treatment, the risk of VTE has increased in recent years; VTE rates additionally depend on the type of cancer (with pancreas, stomach and primary brain tumours having the highest risk) as well as on individual patient‚Äôs and cancer treatment factors. Multiple cancer-specific mechanisms of VTE have been identified and can be classified as mechanisms in which the tumour expresses proteins that alter host systems, such as levels of platelets and leukocytes, and in which the tumour expresses procoagulant proteins released into the circulation that directly activate the coagulation cascade or platelets, such as tissue factor and podoplanin, respectively. As signs and symptoms of VTE may be non-specific, diagnosis requires clinical assessment, evaluation of pre-test probability, and objective diagnostic testing with ultrasonography or CT. Risk assessment tools have been validated to identify patients at risk of VTE. Primary prevention of VTE (thromboprophylaxis) has long been recommended in the inpatient and post-surgical settings, and is now an option in the outpatient setting for individuals with high-risk cancer. Anticoagulant therapy is the cornerstone of therapy, with low molecular weight heparin or newer options such as direct oral anticoagulants. Personalized treatment incorporating risk of bleeding and patient preferences is essential, especially as a diagnosis of VTE is often considered by patients even more distressing than their cancer diagnosis, and can severely affect the quality of life. Future research should focus on current knowledge gaps including optimizing risk assessment tools, biomarker discovery, next-generation anticoagulant development and implementation science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Khorana","given":"Alok A."},{"family":"Mackman","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Falanga","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Pabinger","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Noble","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Ageno","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Moik","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Agnes Y.

  {"id":"khorana_incidence_2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that thromboprophylaxis is beneficial in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer outpatients, but this is not widely adopted because of incomplete understanding of the contemporary incidence of VTE and concerns about bleeding. Therefore, the authors examined the incidence and predictors of VTE in ambulatory patients with bladder, colorectal, lung, ovary, pancreas, or gastric cancers. METHODS: Data were extracted from a large health care claims database of commercially insured patients in the United States between 2004 and 2009. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the cancer cohort (N ¬º 17,284) and an age/sex-matched, noncancer control cohort were evaluated. VTE incidence was recorded during a 3-month to 12-month follow-up period after the initiation of chemotherapy. Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of VTE and bleeding. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 64 years, and 51% of patients were women. VTE occurred in 12.6% of the cancer cohort (n ¬º 2170) over 12 months after the initiation of chemotherapy versus 1.4% of controls (n ¬º 237; P < .0001); incidence ranged by cancer type from 19.2% (pancreatic cancer) to 8.2% (bladder cancer). Predictors of VTE included type of cancer, comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score or obesity), and commonly used specific antineoplastic or supportive care agents (cisplatin, bevacizumab, and erythropoietin). CONCLUSIONS: This large, contemporary, real-world analysis confirmed high rates of VTE in select patients with solid tumors and suggested that the incidence of VTE is high in the real-world setting.

  {"id":"khwaja_acute_2016","abstract":"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a disorder characterized by a clonal proliferation derived from primitive haematopoietic stem cells or progenitor cells. Abnormal differentiation of myeloid cells results in a high level of immature malignant cells and fewer differentiated red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. The disease occurs at all ages, but predominantly occurs in older people (>60 years of age). AML typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms that are attributable to bone marrow failure and may be fatal within weeks or months when left untreated. The genomic landscape of AML has been determined and genetic instability is infrequent with a relatively small number of driver mutations. Mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation are common and are early events in leukaemogenesis. The subclassification of AML has been dependent on the morphology and cytogenetics of blood and bone marrow cells, but specific mutational analysis is now being incorporated. Improvements in treatment in younger patients over the past 35 years has largely been due to dose escalation and better supportive care. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be used to consolidate remission in those patients who are deemed to be at high risk of relapse. A plethora of new agents ‚Äî including those targeted at specific biochemical pathways and immunotherapeutic approaches ‚Äî are now in trial based on improved understanding of disease pathophysiology.

  {"id":"kim_activity_2016","abstract":"Summary Background ALK -rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK inhibitors) such as crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops, often with progression in the brain. Ceritinib is a more potent ALK inhibitor than crizotinib in vitro, crosses the bloodÔøΩÂºérain barrier in vivo, and shows clinical responses in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. We aimed to assess whole-body activity of ceritinib in both ALK inhibitor-pretreated and ALK inhibitor-naive patients with ALK -rearranged NSCLC. Methods ASCEND-1 was an open-label, phase 1 trial that recruited patients from 20 academic hospitals or cancer centres in 11 countries in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with ALK -rearranged locally advanced or metastatic cancer that had progressed despite standard therapy (or for which no effective standard therapy existed), who had at least one measurable lesion at baseline. The primary objective (to determine the maximum tolerated dose) has been reported previously. This updated analysis includes all patients with ALK -rearranged NSCLC given oral ceritinib at the recommended dose of 750 mg/day in the dose-escalation and expansion phases. Here we report the secondary outcomes of overall response, duration of response, and progression-free survival, analysed in all patients who received at least one 750 mg dose of ceritinib. Exploratory analyses included retrospective analysis of intracranial activity by independent neuroradiologists, in patients with untreated or locally treated neurologically stable brain metastases at baseline. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of ceritinib. This study is no longer recruiting patients; however, treatment and follow-up are ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01283516. Findings Between Jan 24, 2011, and July 31, 2013, 255 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of ceritinib 750 mg/day, of whom 246 had ALK -rearranged NSCLC. At data cutoff (April 14, 2014), median follow-up was 11Áπö1 months (IQR 6Áπö7ÔøΩÔøΩ15Áπö2) and 147 (60%) patients had discontinued treatment, 98 (40%) as a result of disease progression. An overall response was reported in 60 (72% [95% CI 61ÔøΩÔøΩ82]) of 83 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 92 (56% [49ÔøΩÔøΩ64]) of 163 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median duration of response was 17Áπö0 months (95% CI 11Áπö3ÔøΩÂøõon-estimable [NE]) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 8Áπö3 months (6Áπö8ÔøΩÔøΩ9Áπö7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median progression-free survival was 18Áπö4 months (95% CI 11Áπö1ÔøΩÂπûE) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 6Áπö9 months (5Áπö6ÔøΩÔøΩ8Áπö7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Of 94 patients with retrospectively confirmed brain metastases and at least one post-baseline MRI or CT tumour assessment, intracranial disease control was reported in 15 (79% [95% CI 54ÔøΩÔøΩ94]) of 19 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and in 49 (65% [54ÔøΩÔøΩ76]) of 75 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Of these 94 patients, 11 had measurable brain lesions and no previous radiotherapy to the brain, six of whom achieved a partial intracranial response. Serious adverse events were recorded in 117 (48%) of 246 patients. The most common grade 3ÔøΩÔøΩ4 laboratory abnormalities were increased alanine aminotransferase (73 [30%] patients) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (25 [10%]). The most common grade 3ÔøΩÔøΩ4 non-laboratory adverse events were diarrhoea and nausea, both of which occurred in 15 (6%) patients. Two on-treatment deaths during the study were deemed to be related to study drug by the investigators, one due to interstitial lung disease and one as a result of multiorgan failure that occurred in the context of infection and ischaemic hepatitis. Interpretation The durable whole-body responses reported, together with the intracranial activity, support a clinical benefit for treatment with ceritinib in patients with ALK -rearranged NSCLC who have received crizotinib, or as an alternative to crizotinib. A confirmatory phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing to assess ceritinib activity in patients with ALK -rearranged NSCLC and brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

  {"id":"kim_cell_2018","abstract":"High-grade serous ovarian cancer, also known as high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer. HGSC appears to arise from the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum. As most HGSC cases present with widespread peritoneal metastases, it is often not clear where HGSC truly originates. Traditionally, the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) was long believed to be the origin of HGSC. Since the late 1990s, the fallopian tube epithelium has emerged as a potential primary origin of HGSC. Particularly, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), a noninvasive tumor lesion formed preferentially in the distal fallopian tube epithelium, was proposed as a precursor for HGSC. It was hypothesized that STIC lesions would progress, over time, to malignant and metastatic HGSC, arising from the fallopian tube or after implanting on the ovary or peritoneum. Many clinical studies and several mouse models support the fallopian tube STIC origin of HGSC. Current evidence indicates that STIC may serve as a precursor for HGSC in high-risk women carrying germline BRCA1 or 2 mutations. Yet not all STIC lesions appear to progress to clinical HGSCs, nor would all HGSCs arise from STIC lesions, even in high-risk women. Moreover, the clinical importance of STIC remains less clear in women in the general population, in which 85‚Åª90% of all HGSCs arise. Recently, increasing attention has been brought to the possibility that many potential precursor or premalignant lesions, though composed of microscopically-and genetically-cancerous cells, do not advance to malignant tumors or lethal malignancies. Hence, rigorous causal evidence would be crucial to establish that STIC is a bona fide premalignant lesion for metastatic HGSC. While not all STICs may transform into malignant tumors, these lesions are clearly associated with increased risk for HGSC. Identification of the molecular characteristics of STICs that predict their malignant potential and clinical behavior would bolster the clinical importance of STIC. Also, as STIC lesions alone cannot account for all HGSCs, other potential cellular origins of HGSC need to be investigated. The fallopian tube stroma in mice, for instance, has been shown to be capable of giving rise to metastatic HGSC, which faithfully recapitulates the clinical behavior and molecular aspect of human HGSC. Elucidating the precise cell(s) of origin of HGSC will be critical for improving the early detection and prevention of ovarian cancer, ultimately reducing ovarian cancer mortality.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Jaeyeon"},{"family":"Park","given":"Eun Young"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Schilder","given":"Jeanne M."},{"family":"Coffey","given":"Donna M."},{"family":"Cho","given":"Chi-Heum"},{"family":"Bast","given":"Robert C."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"kim_cell_2018","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/cancers10110433","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,12]]},"language":"eng","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"11","page":"433","PMCID":"PMC6267333","PMID":"30424539","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"6.575","title":"Cell Origins of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/10/11/433","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"kim_current_2019","abstract":"Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (CAT) is a common complication associated with high morbidity and mortality. In accordance with major clinical trials comparing low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), LMWH is currently the standard treatment for CAT, owing to its efficacy for thrombosis recurrence and improved safety profile compared to VKA. Over the past few years, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as potential alternative therapies to LMWH due to their convenient route of administration and predictable pharmacokinetics, but evidence for their use in CAT is inconclusive, as only a small fraction of the study populations in these trials had CAT. Recently, two large head-to-head trials comparing DOACs to LMWH in CAT patients reported comparable efficacies of DOACs with increased bleeding risk. Occasionally, CAT treatment can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of underlying malignancies and comorbidities. Renal insufficiency and gastrointestinal defects are the main obstacles in anticoagulant selection. Careful choice of treatment candidates and proper anticoagulant strategies are critical for the treatment of CAT; hence, more studies are required to address these challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Sang-A"},{"family":"Yhim","given":"Ho-Young"},{"family":"Bang","given":"Soo-Mee"}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"kim_current_2019","container-title":"Journal of Korean Medical Science","container-title-short":"J Korean Med Sci","DOI":"10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e52","ISSN":"1011-8934, 1598-6357","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"e52","source":"5.354","title":"Current Management of Cancer-associated Venous Thromboembolism: Focus on Direct Oral Anticoagulants","title-short":"Current Management of Cancer-associated Venous Thromboembolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jkms.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e52","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"kim_heterogeneity_2013","abstract":"Background Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is markedly sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. However, acquired resistance to crizotinib is inevitable through several mechanisms. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify genetic alterations associated with crizotinib resistance. Methods Tumor samples were derived from seven ALK-positive NSCLC patients who showed acquired resistance to crizotinib, and these patients were analyzed for ALK, EGFR, and KRAS mutations and ALK and EGFR gene amplifications. In vitro cytotoxicity of crizotinib and ALK downstream signals were compared between crizotinib-naive and -resistant NSCLC cells. Results After a median duration of 6 months (range, 4-12 months), seven ALK-positive NSCLC patients developed acquired resistance to crizotinib. Three patients harbored secondary ALK mutations, including one patient with both mutations: L1196M (n = 2) and G1269A (n = 2). Of note, one patient displayed ALK gene copy number gain (4.1-fold increase compared with the pre-crizotinib specimen) and EGFR L858R mutation with high polysomy. The amphiregulin concentration was high in the supernatant fluid from five patients with malignant pleural effusion (116.4-18934.0 pg/ml). SNU-2535 cells derived from a patient who harbored the G1269 mutation were resistant to crizotinib treatment similar to H3122 CR1 cells. L1196M and G1269A mutant clones were less sensitive to crizotinib and ALK downstream signals were ineffectively suppressed in these clones. Conclusions Genetic changes associated with crizotinib resistance are heterogeneous in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who respond to crizotinib and subsequently develop resistance.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"So Yeon"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Tae Min"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dong Wan"},{"family":"Go","given":"Heounjeong"},{"family":"Keam","given":"Bhumsuk"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Se-Hoon"},{"family":"Ku","given":"Ja-Lok"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Doo Hyun"},{"family":"Heo","given":"Dae Seog"}],"citation-key":"kim_heterogeneity_2013","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

Study subjects received induction treatment that comprised concurrent vincristine, daunorubicin, prednisolone, and nilotinib. After achieving complete hematologic remission (HCR), subjects received either 5 courses of consolidation, followed by 2-year maintenance with nilotinib, or allo-HCT. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed at HCR, and every 3 months thereafter. The molecular responses (MRs) were defined as MR3 for BCR-ABL1/G6PDH ratios ÔøΩÔøΩ10(-3) and MR5 for ratios <10(-5). Ninety evaluable subjects, ages 17 to 71 years, were enrolled in 17 centers. The HCR rate was 91%; 57 subjects received allo-HCT. The cumulative MR5 rate was 94%; the 2-year hematologic relapse-free survival (HRFS) rate was 72% for 82 subjects that achieved HCR, and the 2-year overall survival rate was 72%. Subjects that failed to achieve MR3 or MR5 were 9.1 times (P = .004) or 6.3 times (P = .001) more prone to hematologic relapse, respectively, than those that achieved MR3 or MR5. MRD statuses just before allo-HCT and at 3 months after allo-HCT were predictive of 2-year HRFS. Adverse events occurred mainly during induction, and most were reversible with dose reduction or transient interruption of nilotinib. The combination of nilotinib with high-dose cytotoxic drugs was feasible, and it effectively achieved high cumulative complete molecular remission and HRFS rates.

  {"id":"klempner_cis_2017","abstract":"Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is a universal event and limits clinical efficacy. The third-generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib is active in EGFR-mutant/T790M positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Mechanisms of acquired resistance are emerging, and here we describe a cis-oriented solvent-front EGFR G796S mutation as the resistance mechanism observed in a progression biopsy and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from a patient with initial response followed by progression on osimertinib. This is one of the earliest reports of a sole solvent-front tertiary EGFR mutation as a resistance mechanism to osimertinib. Our case suggests a monoclonal resistance mechanism. We review the importance of the solvent-front residues across TKIs and describe known osimertinib resistance mechanisms. We observe that nearly all clinical osimertinib-resistant tertiary EGFR mutations are oriented in cis with EGFR T790M. This case highlights the importance of mutations affecting EGFR kinase domains and supports the feasibility of broad panel ctDNA assays for detection of novel acquired resistance and tumor heterogeneity in routine clinical care.","author":[{"family":"Klempner","given":"Samuel J."},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Pareen"},{"family":"Schrock","given":"Alexa B."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Siraj M."},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"}],"citation-key":"klempner_cis_2017","container-title":"Lung Cancer (Auckland, N.Z.)","container-title-short":"Lung Cancer Auckl.

  {"id":"klingbiel_prognosis_2015","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although colon cancer (CC) with microsatellite instability (MSI) has a more favorable prognosis than microsatellite stable (MSS) CC, the impact varies according to clinicopathological parameters. We studied how MSI status affects prognosis in a trial-based cohort of stage II and III CC patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin or FOLFIRI.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue specimens of 1254 patients were tested for 10 different loci and were classified as MSI-high (MSI-H) when three or more loci were unstable and MSS otherwise. Study end points were overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS).\nRESULTS: In stage II, RFS and OS were better for patients with MSI-H than with MSS CC [hazard ratio (HR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.65, P = 0.004 and 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.64, P = 0.01). In stage III, RFS was slightly better for patients with MSI-H CC (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.99, P = 0.04), but the difference was not statistically significant for OS (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.44-1.09, P = 0.11). Outcomes for patients with MSI-H CC were not different between the two treatment arms. RFS was better for patients with MSI-H than with MSS CC in the right and left colon, whereas for OS this was significant only in the right colon. For patients with KRAS- and BRAF-mutated CC, but not for double wild-type patients, RFS and OS were significantly better when the tumors were also MSI-H. An interaction test was statistically significant for KRAS and MSI status (P = 0.005), but not for BRAF status (P = 0.14).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that for patients with stage II CC but less so for those with stage III MSI-H is strongly prognostic for RFS and OS. In the presence of 5-FU treatment, stage II patients with MSI-H tumors maintain their survival advantage in comparison with MSS patients and adding irinotecan has no added benefit.

  {"id":"knudsen_final_2023","abstract":"Background: Hydroxyurea (HU) is the most commonly used first-line cytoreductive treatment option for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) worldwide. However, increasing evidence on the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-alpha2 (IFNŒ±) is emerging, and optimal first-line treatment is to be established.Aims: To compare the efficacy and safety of HU vs. low-dose IFNŒ± in patients with MPN over five years.Methods: DALIAH (NCT01387763) was a randomized phase III trial of HU vs. IFNŒ± in newly diagnosed or untreated patients with MPN (essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), prefibrotic myelofibrosis (PreMF), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)). Patients &gt; age 60 were randomized (1:1:1) to HU, IFNŒ±-2a, or IFNŒ±-2b whereas patients ‚â§ age 60 were randomized to IFNŒ±-2a or IFNŒ±-2b. The primary outcome was the JAK2V617F molecular response (MR) rate at 18, 36, and 60 months per 2009 European LeukemiaNetwork (ELN) (ET, PV, PreMF) or 2005 European Myelofibrosis Network (EUMNET) (PMF) criteria. Secondary outcomes included the complete clinicohematologic response (CHR) rate at 12 months. The JAK2V617F allele burden was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on peripheral blood (assay sensitivity: 0.1%). Primary and secondary outcomes were compared between groups (HU vs. IFNŒ± or HU vs. IFNŒ± &gt; 60 years) using Fisher's exact test (categorical variables) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (continuous variables). Paired comparisons (within groups) were made using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Serial JAK2V617F measurements were compared by unadjusted mixed-effects linear regression analysis.Results: We included 203 patients (ET: 73 (36%), PV: 89 (44%), PreMF: 16 (8%), and PMF: 25 (12%)) in the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Baseline characteristics were well balanced except for median age (HU: 68 years vs. IFNŒ±: 59 years, p&lt;0.0001) ( Table 1). The MR rate by ITT analysis was similar between HU and IFNŒ± (18 months: 19% vs. 21%, p=1.00; 36 months: 19% vs. 26%, p=0.64; 60 months: 23% vs. 24%, p=1.00) (Figure 1A). However, the JAK2V617F allele burden was significantly lower in the IFNŒ± group at month 36 and beyond (Figure 1B) and the absolute median (IQR) change in JAK2V617F allele burden (baseline to 60 months) was greater with IFNŒ± (-20% (-9;-49) vs. -7% (3;-15), p=0.0053) (Figure 1C). Two patients (IFNŒ±: n=2) were in complete molecular remission (undetectable JAK2V617F) at 60 months. The CHR rate by ITT analysis was higher with HU at 18 months (58% vs. 38%, p=0.03) but similar at all other time points (12 months: 50% vs. 36%, p=0.21; 60 months: 24% vs. 22%, p=0.83) ( Figure 1D). A post hoc subgroup analysis comparing HU with IFNŒ± &gt; age 60 showed comparable efficacy results. Among patients remaining on treatment (per-protocol analysis), the MR and CHR rates were superior in the IFNŒ± group compared to the HU group at 36 months and beyond. The MR and CHR rates (HU vs. IFNŒ±) by per-protocol analysis were: MR at 36 months: 23% vs. 56%, p=0.01; MR at 48 months: 27% vs. 59%, p=0.02; MR at 60 months: 35% vs. 67%, p=0.03; CHR at 36 months: 33% vs. 67%, p=0.002; CHR at 60 months: 38% vs. 62%, p=0.05.Overall treatment discontinuation at 60 months was 60% (HU: 37% vs. IFNŒ±: 65%, p=0.0019). The most common cause of treatment discontinuation was adverse events (HU: 6/38 (16%); IFNŒ±: 71/165 (43%)). Adverse events ‚â• grade 3 occurred in 46% (HU: 58% vs. IFNŒ±: 45%, p=0.15). Nineteen major thrombotic events were reported in 16 patients (HU: 4 events in 4 patients; IFNŒ±&gt;60: 12 events in 10 patients; IFNŒ±‚â§60: 3 events in 2 patients), corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.6 per 100 person-years for HU and 3.4 per 100 person-years for IFNŒ± (IFNŒ±&gt;60: 6.2; IFNŒ±‚â§60: 1.2). None of the patients transformed into secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Five patients died during follow-up (HU: 2; IFNŒ±: 3).Bone marrow histologic remission rates at 36 and 60 months will be presented at the meeting.Conclusion: ITT analysis detected no significant difference in the MR or CHR rates between HU and IFNŒ± with long-term treatment (5 years) among patients with MPN, reflecting a higher treatment discontinuation rate in the IFNŒ± group (65%). Thus, using the per-protocol principle, the MR and CHR rates were superior in the IFNŒ± group at 36 months and beyond.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Knudsen","given":"Trine Alma"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Dennis Lund"},{"family":"Ocias","given":"Lukas Frans"},{"family":"Bjerrum","given":"Ole"},{"family":"Brabrand","given":"Mette"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Sarah Friis"},{"family":"Eickhardt-Dalb√∏ge","given":"Christina Schjellerup"},{"family":"Ellervik","given":"Christina"},{"family":"El Fassi","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Frederiksen","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Kj√¶r","given":"Lasse"},{"family":"Kristensen","given":"Thomas Kielsgaard"},{"family":"Kruse","given":"Torben A."},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Morten Kranker"},{"family":"Mourits-Andersen","given":"Torben"},{"family":"M√∂ller","given":"S√∂ren"},{"family":"Overgaard","given":"Ulrik Malthe"},{"family":"Severinsen","given":"Marianne Tang"},{"family":"Skov","given":"Vibe"},{"family":"S√∏rensen","given":"Anders Lindholm"},{"family":"Stentoft","given":"Jesper"},{"family":"Starklint","given":"J√∏rn"},{"family":"Stricker","given":"Karin","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Thomassen","given":"Mads"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Thomas S."},{"family":"Hasselbalch","given":"Hans C."}],"citation-key":"knudsen_final_2023","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-173127","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"Supplement 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"page":"746","source":"Silverchair","title":"Final Analysis of the Daliah Trial: A Randomized Phase III Trial of Interferon-Œ± Versus Hydroxyurea in Patients with MPN","title-short":"Final Analysis of the Daliah Trial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2023-173127","volume":"142"},

We reviewed full slide sets of 1009 cases of 2555 patients diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma that were referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency over a 16-year period (1984 to 2000). On the basis of the reviewed cases we extrapolated the distribution of tumor type in low-stage (I/II) and high-stage (III/IV) tumors. We then compared the frequencies with those seen in a large hospital practice. The overall frequency of tumor types was as follows: high-grade serous‚Äî68.1%, clear-cell‚Äî12.2%, endometrioid‚Äî11.3%, mucinous‚Äî3.4%, low-grade serous‚Äî3.4%, rare types‚Äî1.6%. High-grade serous carcinomas accounted for 35.5% of stage I/II tumors and 87.7% of stage III/IV tumors. In contrast, clear-cell (26.2% vs. 4.5%), endometrioid (26.6% vs. 2.5%), and mucinous (7.5% vs. 1.2%) carcinomas were relatively more common among the low-stage versus high-stage tumors. This distribution was found to be very similar in 410 consecutive cases from the Washington Hospital Center. The distribution of ovarian carcinoma types differs significantly in patients with low-stage versus high-stage ovarian carcinoma when contemporary diagnostic criteria are used, with consistent results seen in 2 independent case series. These findings reflect important biological differences in the behavior of the major tumor types, with important clinical implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"K√∂bel","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Kalloger","given":"Steve E."},{"family":"Huntsman","given":"David G."},{"family":"Santos","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Swenerton","given":"Kenneth D."},{"family":"Seidman","given":"Jeffrey D."},{"family":"Gilks","given":"C.

  {"id":"kok_bidirectional_2017","abstract":"Background: Unprovoked (idiopathic) venous thromboembolism (VTE) with no obvious antecedent risk factors, is associated with a significant risk of subsequent occult cancer. Conversely, there is a heightened risk of VTE in cancer patients. This bidirectional risk can be estimated from population-based cohort studies conducted in East Asians.\nMethods: A literature search using medical subject heading terms and Boolean logic in PubMed and MedLine was performed in April 2017. Twenty-two papers reported from East Asia were retrieved for study and data synthesis. Proportional meta-analysis with a random-effects model was used to synthesize data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) when appropriate.\nResults: Synthesis of data on VTE incidence in the East Asian population (I2 = 76.2%) showed that pooled incidence was 20.3 (95% CI, 11.2‚Äì32) per 100,000 person-years. VTE incidence steadily increased with age. Unprovoked VTE accounted for 35% (95% CI, 24%‚Äì48%) of all cases of incident VTE (I2 = 99.7%). The overall cancer risk was significantly higher (2.3-fold) in the VTE cohort than in comparators. Among the patients with unprovoked VTE, approximately 7% had a subsequent cancer diagnosis within 2 years of the first episode of idiopathic VTE. The risk of VTE recurrence was increased in cancer patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.26‚Äì1.99). VTE incidence was 9.9 per 1,000 person-years in cancer patients, particularly in liver, pancreas, and lung cancer patients.\nConclusion: Newly diagnosed VTE incidence is estimated at approximately 4,400 new cases annually in Taiwan and 7,100 in South Korea. Similar to the trend in VTE incidence among the general population, VTE risk in East Asian cancer patients is markedly lessened.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kok","given":"Victor"}],"call-number":"4 (‰∏≠È¢ÑË≠¶)","citation-key":"kok_bidirectional_2017","container-title":"Cancer Management and Research","container-title-short":"CMAR","DOI":"10.2147/CMAR.S151331","ISSN":"1179-1322","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"language":"en","page":"751-759","source":"3.602","title":"Bidirectional risk between venous thromboembolism and cancer in East Asian patients: synthesis of evidence from recent population-based epidemiological studies","title-short":"Bidirectional risk between venous thromboembolism and cancer in East Asian patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.dovepress.com/bidirectional-risk-between-venous-thromboembolism-and-cancer-in-east-a-peer-reviewed-article-CMAR","volume":"Volume 9"},
  {"id":"komrokji_u2af1_2023","abstract":"Hemolysis is a well-recognized but poorly characterized phenomenon in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Its pathobiological basis seems to underpin a nonimmune etiology whose clinical significance has not been adequately characterized. Hemolysis in MDS is often attributed to either ineffective intramedullary erythropoiesis or acquired hemoglobinopathies and red blood cell (RBC) membrane defects. These heterogeneous processes have not been associated with specific genetic subsets of the disease. We aimed to describe the prevalence of hemolysis among patients with MDS, their baseline characteristics, molecular features, and resulting impact on outcomes. We considered baseline serum haptoglobin &lt;10 mg/dL a surrogate marker for intravascular hemolysis. Among 519 patients, 10% had hemolysis. The baseline characteristics were similar among both groups. Only 13% of patients with hemolysis were Coombs-positive, suggesting that hemolysis in MDS is largely not immune-mediated. Inferior survival trends were observed among lower-risk patients with MDS undergoing hemolysis. Decreased response rates to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and higher responses to hypomethylating agents (HMA) were also observed in the hemolysis group. U2AF1 and EZH2 hotspot mutations were more prevalent among those undergoing hemolysis (P¬†&lt; .05). U2AF1 mutations were observed in 30% of patients with hemolysis and occurred almost exclusively at the S34 hotspot. Somatic mutations encoding splicing factors may affect erythrocyte membrane components, biochemical properties, and RBC metabolic function, which underpin the development of atypical clones from erythroid precursors in MDS presenting with hemolysis. Future studies will explore the contribution of altered splicing to the development of acquired hemoglobinopathies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Komrokji","given":"Rami"},{"family":"Aguirre","given":"Luis E."},{"family":"Al Ali","given":"Najla"},{"family":"Hussaini","given":"Mohamad"},{"family":"Sallman","given":"David"},{"family":"Rollison","given":"Dana"},{"family":"Padron","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"komrokji_u2af1_2023","container-title":"Blood Advances","container-title-short":"Blood Adv.","DOI":"10.1182/bloodadvances.2022007504","ISSN":"2473-9529","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1-8","source":"Silverchair","title":"U2AF1 and EZH2 mutations are associated with nonimmune hemolytic anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2022007504","volume":"7"},

The hazard ratio for combination versus sequential treatment was 0.92 (95% CI 0.79-1.08; p=0.3281). The frequency of grade 3-4 toxicity over all lines of treatment did not differ significantly between the two groups, except for grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, which occurred more often with sequential treatment than with combination treatment (13%vs 7%; p=0.004).\nINTERPRETATION: Combination treatment does not significantly improve overall survival compared with the sequential use of cytotoxic drugs in advanced colorectal cancer. Thus sequential treatment remains a valid option for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.","author":[{"family":"Koopman","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Antonini","given":"Ninja F."},{"family":"Douma","given":"Joep"},{"family":"Wals","given":"Jaap"},{"family":"Honkoop","given":"Aafke H."},{"family":"Erdkamp","given":"Frans Lg"},{"family":"Jong","given":"Robert S.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Rodenburg","given":"Cees J."},{"family":"Vreugdenhil","given":"Gerard"},{"family":"Loosveld","given":"Olaf Jl"},{"family":"Bochove","given":"Aart","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Sinnige","given":"Harm Am"},{"family":"Creemers","given":"Geert-Jan M."},{"family":"Tesselaar","given":"Margot Et"},{"family":"Slee","given":"Peter H.

  {"id":"kopetz_breakwater_2021","abstract":"TPS3619\n\nBackground: Approximately 10% of patients (pts) with mCRC have BRAF mutations (mostly V600E). 1L tx options for BRAFV600E mCRC are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy ¬± anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR, or immune checkpoint inhibitors in pts with MSI-H tumors. In Europe, Japan, and USA, the combination of BRAF inhibitor enco + EGFR inhibitor cetux is approved for tx of BRAFV600E mCRC after prior therapy. In BEACON CRC, enco + cetux resulted in a median overall survival (OS) of 9.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.0‚Äì11.3) and an objective response rate (ORR) of 19.5% (95% CI: 14.5%‚Äì25.4%) in previously treated pts with BRAFV600E mCRC (median follow-up: 12.8 months); 57.4% of pts had grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs); 9% discontinued due to AEs.

  {"id":"kremerhovinga_thrombotic_2017","abstract":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP; also known as Moschcowitz disease) is characterized by the concomitant occurrence of often severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and a variable degree of ischaemic organ damage, particularly affecting the brain, heart and kidneys. Acute TTP was almost universally fatal until the introduction of plasma therapy, which improved survival from <10% to 80‚Äì90%. However, patients who survive an acute episode are at high risk of relapse and of long-term morbidity. A timely diagnosis is vital but challenging, as TTP shares symptoms and clinical presentation with numerous conditions, including, for example, haemolytic uraemic syndrome and other thrombotic microangiopathies. The underlying pathophysiology is a severe deficiency of the activity of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS13), the protease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimeric strings. Ultra-large vWF strings remain uncleaved after endothelial cell secretion and anchorage, bind to platelets and form microthrombi, leading to the clinical manifestations of TTP. Congenital TTP (Upshaw‚ÄìSchulman syndrome) is the result of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ADAMTS13, whereas acquired TTP is an autoimmune disorder caused by circulating anti‚ÄëADAMTS13 autoantibodies, which inhibit the enzyme or increase its clearance. Consequently, immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids and often rituximab, supplement plasma exchange therapy in patients with acquired TTP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kremer Hovinga","given":"Johanna A."},{"family":"Coppo","given":"Paul"},{"family":"L√§mmle","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Moake","given":"Joel L."},{"family":"Miyata","given":"Toshiyuki"},{"family":"Vanhoorelbeke","given":"Karen"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"kremerhovinga_thrombotic_2017","container-title":"Nature Reviews Disease Primers","container-title-short":"Nat.

Objectives To determine the frequency of oncogenic drivers in patients with lung adenocarcinomas and to use the data to select treatments targeting the identified driver(s) and measure survival. Design, Setting, and Participants From 2009 through 2012, 14 sites in the United States enrolled patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas and a performance status of 0 through 2 and tested their tumors for 10 drivers.

  {"id":"kroep_impact_2018","abstract":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is often accompanied by co-morbidities, which complicate and confound data interpretation concerning VTE-related mortality, costs and quality of life. We aimed to assess the contribution of co-morbidities to the burden of VTE. The PREFER in VTE registry, across seven European countries, documented and followed acute VTE patients over 12 months. Patients with co-morbidities were grouped in major co-morbidity groups: cancer, cardiovascular (CV) comorbidity (other than VTE), CV risks, venous, renal, liver, respiratory, bone and joint diseases, and lower extremity paralysis. Mortality rates and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) utility values grouped per co-morbidity were compared to the UK general population. Regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of co-morbidities on mortality and HrQoL. VTE were analyzed together and separately as pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In total, 3455 patients were included, 40.5% with PE and 59.5% with DVT. 13% and 16% of the PE and DVT patients had no co-morbidities and had a 12-month mortality rate of 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Frequency and severity of co-morbidities increased mortality rates up to 30%. The EQ-5D-5L index in patients without co-morbidities were 0.826 and 0.838 for PE and DVT. These scores decreased to 0.638 and 0.555 in the presence of co-morbidities. Co-morbidities in VTE patients are common. VTE had an impact on mortality and HrQoL, and additional impact of co-morbidities was seen. Awareness of the presence of co-morbidities is important when making VTE-related treatment decisions. The presence of co-morbidities in PE and DVT patients is common and their frequency and severity in VTE patients have a substantial impact on mortality rates and HrQoL.

Patients and Methods Within the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial that compared a busulfan-based RIC with MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 129 patients were enrolled from 18 centers. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and were stratified according to donor, age, and blast count. Results Engraftment was comparable between both groups. The CI of acute graft-versus-host disease II to IV was 32.3% after RIC and 37.5% after MAC ( P = .35). The CI of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 61.6% after RIC and 64.7% after MAC ( P = .76). The CI of nonrelapse mortality after 1 year was 17% (95% CI, 8% to 26%) after RIC and 25% (95% CI, 15% to 36%) after MAC ( P = .29). The CI of relapse at 2 years was 17% (95% CI, 8% to 26%) after RIC and 15% (95% CI, 6% to 24%) after MAC ( P = .6), which resulted in a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival of 62% (95% CI, 50% to 74%) and 76% (95% CI, 66% to 87%), respectively, after RIC, and 58% (95% CI, 46% to 71%) and 63% (95% CI, 51% to 75%), respectively, after MAC ( P = .58 and P = .08, respectively).

Here, we demonstrate that lenalidomide induces the ubiquitination of casein kinase 1A1 (CK1Œ±) by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (known as CRL4(CRBN)), resulting in CK1Œ± degradation. CK1Œ± is encoded by a gene within the common deleted region for del(5q) MDS and haploinsufficient expression sensitizes cells to lenalidomide therapy, providing a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic window of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS. We found that mouse cells are resistant to lenalidomide but that changing a single amino acid in mouse Crbn to the corresponding human residue enables lenalidomide-dependent degradation of CK1Œ±. We further demonstrate that minor side chain modifications in thalidomide and a novel analogue, CC-122, can modulate the spectrum of substrates targeted by CRL4(CRBN). These findings have implications for the clinical activity of lenalidomide and related compounds, and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of novel modulators of E3 ubiquitin ligases.","author":[{"family":"Kr√∂nke","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Emma C."},{"family":"Hollenbach","given":"Paul W."},{"family":"MacBeth","given":"Kyle J."},{"family":"Hurst","given":"Slater N."},{"family":"Udeshi","given":"Namrata D."},{"family":"Chamberlain","given":"Philip P"},{"family":"Mani","given":"D.

Although this disorder is seemingly well defined because of this single molecular defect, in reality type 2B VWD is a clinically heterogeneous disorder that can be difficult to identify and manage. Diagnostic criteria include a history of mucocutaneous bleeding, laboratory studies showing enhanced VWF binding of platelets and/or a 2B VWD genetic variant, and a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Thrombocytopenia, although not always present, is common and can be exacerbated by physiologic stressors such as pregnancy. The mainstay of therapy for type 2B VWD is VWF replacement therapy. Adjunct therapies useful in other types of VWD, such as antifibrinolytics, are also used in type 2B VWD. 1-Desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) is controversial because of exacerbation of thrombocytopenia, but is, in practice, sometimes used for minor bleeding.

  {"id":"kuesap_coexistence_2015","abstract":"Hemoglobinopathy and malaria are commonly found worldwide particularly in malaria endemic areas. Thalassemia, the alteration of globin chain synthesis, has been reported to confer resistance against malaria. The prevalence of thalassemia was investigated in 101 malaria patients with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax along the Thai-Myanmar border to examine protective effect of thalassemia against severe malaria. Hemoglobin typing was performed using low pressure liquid chromatography (LPLC) and Œ±-thalassemia was confirmed by multiplex PCR. Five types of thalassemia were observed in malaria patients. The 2 major types of thalassemia were Hb E (18.8%) and Œ±-thalassemia-2 (11.9%). There was no association between thalassemia hemoglobinopathy and malaria parasitemia, an indicator of malaria disease severity. Thalassemia had no significant association with P. vivax infection, but the parasitemia in patients with coexistence of P. vivax and thalassemia was about 2-3 times lower than those with coexistence of P. falciparum and thalassemia and malaria without thalassemia. Furthermore, the parasitemia of P. vivax in patients with coexistence of Hb E showed lower value than coexistence with other types of thalassemia and malaria without coexistence. Parasitemia, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values in patients with coexistence of thalassemia other than Hb E were significantly lower than those without coexistence of thalassemia. Furthermore, parasitemia with coexistence of Hb E were 2 times lower than those with coexistence of thalassemia other than Hb E. In conclusion, the results may, at least in part, support the protective effect of thalassemia on the development of hyperparasitemia and severe anemia in malaria patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuesap","given":"Jiraporn"},{"family":"Chaijaroenkul","given":"W."},{"family":"Rungsihirunrat","given":"K."},{"family":"Pongjantharasatien","given":"K."},{"family":"Na-Bangchang","given":"Kesara"}],"citation-key":"kuesap_coexistence_2015","container-title":"The Korean Journal of Parasitology","container-title-short":"Korean J Parasitol","DOI":"10.3347/kjp.2015.53.3.265","ISSN":"0023-4001","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6]]},"page":"265-270","PMCID":"PMC4510677","PMID":"26174819","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Coexistence of Malaria and Thalassemia in Malaria Endemic Areas of Thailand","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4510677/","volume":"53"},

However, it has become a predominant cancer and now accounts for approximately 10% of cancer-related mortality in western countries. The ‚Äòrise‚Äô of colorectal cancer in developed countries can be attributed to the increasingly ageing population, unfavourable modern dietary habits and an increase in risk factors, such as smoking, low physical exercise and obesity. New treatments for primary and metastatic colorectal cancer have emerged, providing additional options for patients; these treatments include laparoscopic surgery for primary disease, more-aggressive resection of metastatic disease (such as liver and pulmonary metastases), radiotherapy for rectal cancer, and neoadjuvant and palliative chemotherapies. However, these new treatment options have had limited impact on cure rates and long-term survival. For these reasons, and the recognition that colorectal cancer is long preceded by a polypoid precursor, screening programmes have gained momentum.

  {"id":"kumar_treatment_2021","abstract":"The management of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is becoming increasingly complex, with the identification of driver mutations/rearrangements and the development and availability of appropriate targeted therapies. In 2018, a group of medical oncologists with expertise in treating lung cancers used data from the published literature and experience to arrive at practical consensus recommendations for the treatment of advanced NSCLC for use by the community oncologists. These recommendations were subsequently published in 2019, with a plan to be updated annually. This article is an update to the 2019 consensus statement. For updating the consensus statement, a total of 25 clinically relevant questions on the management of patients with NSCLC on which consensus would be sought were drafted. The PubMed database was searched using the following terms combined with the Boolean operator ÔøΩ¶Ø∑ND:ÔøΩÔøΩ (lung cancer, phase 3, non-small cell lung cancer AND non-small-cell lung cancer [MeSH Terms]) AND (clinical trial, phase 3 [MeSH Terms]) AND (clinical trial, phase iii [MeSH Terms]).

The survey results and literature were reviewed by the core members to draft the consensus statements. The expert consensus was that molecular testing is a crucial step to be considered for patients with NSCLC at baseline, and in those who progress on first-line chemotherapy and have not undergone any prior testing. For mutations/rearrangement-negative patients who progress on first-line immunotherapy, doublet or single-agent chemotherapy with docetaxel and/or gemcitabine and/or ramucirumab should be considered. Patients who progress on the newer anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors should be considered for second-line therapy with lorlatinib or systemic chemotherapy.

As a consequence of such translocations, the oncogene comes under the control of an active immunoglobulin locus, causing deregulated, constitutive expression of the translocated gene.Normal B cells depend on B-cell receptor (BCR) expression for survival. The selection for expression of a BCR also seems to operate in most malignant B cells.Although there is strong evidence that most B-cell lymphomas depend on BCR expression, there are a few exceptions ‚Äî namely classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, some post-transplant lymphomas, and the rare primary effusion lymphomas.In several lymphomas, there is a strong indication that the lymphoma cells recognize an antigen and that stimulation by antigen binding contributes to the survival and proliferation of lymphoma cells.In many lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, the tumour microenvironment seems to be important for the survival and/or proliferation of the lymphoma cells.The recognition that the survival and/or proliferation of many B-cell lymphomas depends on their interaction with other cells in the microenvironment, as well as on expression of the B-cell receptor and, sometimes, antigen activation, might lead to novel treatment options for B-cell lymphomas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"K√ºppers","given":"Ralf"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"kuppers_mechanisms_2005","container-title":"Nature Reviews Cancer","container-title-short":"Nat.

This has required that the original model be revised and expanded to incorporate these findings. The new model divides type I tumors into three groups: i)¬†endometriosis-related tumors that include endometrioid, clear cell, and seromucinous carcinomas; ii) low-grade serous carcinomas; and iii) mucinous carcinomas and malignant Brenner tumors. As in the previous model, type II tumors are composed, for the most part, of high-grade serous carcinomas that can be further subdivided into morphologic and molecular subtypes. Type I tumors develop from benign extraovarian lesions that implant on the ovary and which can subsequently undergo malignant transformation, whereas many type II carcinomas develop from intraepithelial carcinomas in the fallopian tube and, as a result, disseminate as carcinomas that involve the ovary and extraovarian sites, which probably accounts for their clinically aggressive behavior. The new molecular genetic data, especially those derived from next-generation sequencing, further underline the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer and identify actionable mutations. The dualistic model highlights these differences between type I and type II tumors which, it can be argued, describe entirely different groups of diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kurman","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Shih","given":"Ie-Ming"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"kurman_dualistic_2016","container-title":"The American Journal of Pathology","container-title-short":"The American Journal of Pathology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.11.011","ISSN":"0002-9440","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"733-747","PMCID":"PMC5808151","PMID":"27012190","source":"5.77","title":"The Dualistic Model of Ovarian Carcinogenesis: Revisited, Revised, and Expanded","title-short":"The Dualistic Model of Ovarian Carcinogenesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944016000080","volume":"186"},

  {"id":"kuusanmaki_ex_2023","abstract":"The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has revolutionized the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients not benefiting from intensive chemotherapy. Nevertheless, treatment failure remains a challenge, and predictive markers are needed, particularly for relapsed or refractory AML. Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing may correlate with outcomes, but its prospective predictive value remains unexplored. Here we report the results of the first stage of the prospective phase II VenEx trial evaluating the utility and predictiveness of venetoclax sensitivity testing using different cell culture conditions and cell viability assays in patients receiving venetoclax-azacitidine. Participants with de novo AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, relapsed or refractory AML, or secondary AML were included. The primary endpoint was the treatment response in participants showing ex vivo sensitivity and the key secondary endpoints were the correlation of sensitivity with responses and survival. Venetoclax sensitivity testing was successful in 38/39 participants. Experimental conditions significantly influenced the predictive accuracy. Blast-specific venetoclax sensitivity measured in conditioned medium most accurately correlated with treatment outcomes; 88% of sensitive participants achieved a treatment response. The median survival was significantly longer for participants who were ex vivo-sensitive to venetoclax (14.6 months for venetoclax-sensitive patients vs. 3.5 for venetoclax-insensitive patients, P&lt;0.001). This analysis illustrates the feasibility of integrating drug-response profiling into clinical practice and demonstrates excellent predictivity.

We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. Methods After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy. Results Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72%, with no median for the study reached. The drug resulted in grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects.

  {"id":"l_comparative_2021","abstract":"INTRODUCTION Real-world clinical outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion (exon20ins) mutations have not been extensively studied. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the clinical outcomes of EGFR exon20ins compared with common EGFR (cEGFR) mutations. METHODS Adults with advanced NSCLC harboring any EGFR mutations in the NSCLC Flatiron registry (2011 through May 2020) were included. To compare the relative prognosis (prognostic value) of exon20ins vs cEGFR, real-world overall survival (rwOS) was the primary endpoint. Separately, to compare the relative response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment (predictive value), real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) was the primary endpoint. RESULTS For the prognostic value analysis, 3014 patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC (cEGFR, n = 2833; EGFR exon20ins, n = 181) were eligible. The median (95% CI) rwOS was 16.2 (11.04-19.38) months in the EGFR exon20ins cohort vs 25.5 (24.48-27.04) months in the cEGFR cohort (adjusted HR, 1.75 [1.45-2.13]; p < 0.0001); 5-year rwOS was 8% and 19%, respectively. For the predictive value analysis, 2825 patients received TKI treatment and were eligible (cEGFR, n = 2749; EGFR exon20ins, n = 76). The median (95% CI) rwPFS from start of the first TKI was 2.9 (2.14-3.91) months in the EGFR exon20ins cohort vs 10.5 (10.05-10.94) months in the cEGFR cohort (adjusted HR, 2.69 [2.05-3.54]; p < 0001). Among patients with EGFR exon20ins, the most common prescribed first-line therapy was platinum-based chemotherapy (61.3%) followed by EGFR TKIs (21.5%); second-line treatments were varied, with no clear standard of care. CONCLUSIONS Patients with EGFR exon20ins have poor prognosis and receive little benefit from EGFR TKI treatment. More effective therapies are needed in this difficult-to-treat population.","author":[{"family":"L","given":"yudmila"},{"family":"M","given":"inchom Anna"},{"family":"V","given":"iteri Santiago"},{"family":"B","given":"auml Joshua"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"G","given":"adgeel Shirish M."},{"family":"T","given":"rigo Jose Manuel"},{"family":"B","given":"ackenroth Daniel"},{"family":"Li","given":"Tracy"},{"family":"L","given":"ondhe Anil"},{"family":"M","given":"ahadevia P."},{"family":"G","given":"irard Nicolas Bazhenova"}],"citation-key":"l_comparative_2021","container-title":"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","container-title-short":"Lung Cancer Amst.

  {"id":"l_epithelial_2019","abstract":"Epithelial ovarian cancer generally presents at an advanced stage and is the most common cause of gynaecological cancer death. Treatment requires expert multidisciplinary care. Population-based screening has been ineffective, but new approaches for early diagnosis and prevention that leverage molecular genomics are in development. Initial therapy includes surgery and adjuvant therapy. Epithelial ovarian cancer is composed of distinct histological subtypes with unique genomic characteristics, which are improving the precision and effectiveness of therapy, allowing discovery of predictors of response such as mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, and homologous recombination deficiency for DNA damage response pathway inhibitors or resistance (cyclin E1). Rapidly evolving techniques to measure genomic changes in tumour and blood allow for assessment of sensitivity and emergence of resistance to therapy, and might be accurate indicators of residual disease. Recurrence is usually incurable, and patient symptom control and quality of life are key considerations at this stage. Treatments for recurrence have to be designed from a patient's perspective and incorporate meaningful measures of benefit. Urgent progress is needed to develop evidence and consensus-based treatment guidelines for each subgroup, and requires close international cooperation in conducting clinical trials through academic research groups such as the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup.","author":[{"family":"L","given":"heureux Stephanie"},{"family":"G","given":"ourley Charlie"},{"family":"V","given":"ergote Ignace"},{"family":"O","given":"za Amit M."}],"citation-key":"l_epithelial_2019","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32552-2","ISSN":"1474-547X","issue":"10177","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,23]]},"language":"en","page":"1240-1253","PMID":"30910306","source":"PubMed","title":"Epithelial ovarian cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"393"},

  {"id":"lam_synchronous_2014","abstract":"Synchronous colorectal carcinoma refers to more than one primary colorectal carcinoma detected in a single patient at initial presentation. A literature review has shown that the prevalence of the disease is approximately 3.5% of all colorectal carcinomas. This disease has a male to female ratio of 1.8:1. The mean age at presentation of patients with synchronous colorectal cancer is in the early half of the seventh decade. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn‚Äôs disease), hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis and serrated polyps/hyperplastic polyposis are known to have a higher risk of synchronous colorectal carcinoma. These predisposing factors account for slightly more than 10% of synchronous colorectal carcinomas. Synchronous colorectal carcinoma is more common in the right colon when compared to solitary colorectal cancer. On pathological examination, some synchronous colorectal carcinomas are mucinous adenocarcinomas. They are usually associated with adenomas and metachronous colorectal carcinomas. Most of the patients with synchronous colorectal cancer have two carcinomas but up to six have been reported in one patient. Patients with synchronous colorectal carcinoma have a higher proportion of microsatellite instability cancer than patients with a solitary colorectal carcinoma. Also, limited data have revealed that in many synchronous colorectal carcinomas, carcinomas in the same patient have different patterns of microsatellite instability status, p53 mutation and K-ras mutation. Overall, the prognosis of patients with synchronous colorectal carcinoma is not significantly different from that in patients with solitary colorectal carcinoma, although a marginally better prognosis has been reported in patients with synchronous colorectal carcinoma in some series. A different management approach and long-term clinical follow-up are recommended for some patients with synchronous colorectal cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Lam","given":"Alfred King-Yin"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Sally Sze-Yan"},{"family":"Leung","given":"Melissa"}],"citation-key":"lam_synchronous_2014","container-title":"World Journal of Gastroenterology : WJG","container-title-short":"World J Gastroenterol","DOI":"10.3748/wjg.v20.i22.6815","ISSN":"1007-9327","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,14]]},"page":"6815-6820","PMCID":"PMC4051920","PMID":"24944471","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Synchronous colorectal cancer: Clinical, pathological and molecular implications","title-short":"Synchronous colorectal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4051920/","volume":"20"},

Eighty percent of B-lineage and 97% of T-cell ALL patients achieved a CR (P = .01). The coexpression of myeloid antigens did not affect the response rate or duration. Seventy percent of those with cytogenetic or molecular evidence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and 84% of those without such evidence achieved a CR (P = .11). Patients in remission received multiagent consolidation treatment, central nervous system prophylaxis, late intensification, and maintenance chemotherapy for a total of 24 months. After a median follow-up time of 43 months, the median survival for all 197 patients is 36 months; the median remission duration for the 167 CR patients is 29 months. Favorable pretreatment characteristics relative to remission duration or survival are younger age, the presence of a mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy, a white blood cell count (WBC) less than 30,000/microL, L1 morphology, T or TMy immunophenotype, and the absence of the Ph chromosome. The estimates of the proportion surviving at 3 years are 69% for patients less than 30 years old, 39% for those 30 to 59 years old, 89% for those who had a mediastinal mass, 59% with WBC less than 30,000/microL, 63% with L1 morphology, 69% for T or TMy antigen expression, and 62% for those who lack the Ph chromosome. Fifteen patients (8%) had no unfavorable prognostic factors and have an estimated probability of survival at 5 years of 100% (95% confidence interval, 77% to 100%). This intensive chemotherapy regimen produces a high remission rate and a high proportion of durable remissions in adults with ALL.","author":[{"family":"Larson","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Rk","given":"Dodge"},{"family":"Cp","given":"Burns"},{"family":"Lee","given":"EJ"},{"family":"Stone","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Schulman","given":"P"},{"family":"Duggan","given":"D"},{"family":"Davey,","given":""},{"family":"Sobol","given":"RE"},{"family":"Frankel,","given":""}],"citation-key":"larson_fivedrug_1995","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.v85.8.2025.bloodjournal8582025","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"en","page":"2025-2037","title":"A five-drug remission induction regimen with intensive consolidation for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: cancer and leukemia group B study 8811.","type":"article-journal","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"le_landscape_2018","abstract":"Purpose: Osimertinib was initially approved for T790M-positive nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, more recently, for first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, resistance mechanisms to osimertinib have been incompletely described. Experimental Design: Using cohorts from The University of Texas MD Anderson Lung Cancer Moonshot GEMINI and Moffitt Cancer Center lung cancer databases, we collected clinical data for patients treated with osimertinib. Molecular profiling analysis was performed at the time of progression in a subset of the patients. Results: In the 118 patients treated with osimertinib, 42 had molecular profiling at progression. T790M was preserved in 21 (50%) patients and lost in 21 (50%). EGFR C797 and L792 (26%) mutations were the most common resistance mechanism and were observed exclusively in T790M-preserved cases. MET amplification was the second most common alteration (14%). Recurrent alterations were observed in 22 genes/pathways, including PIK3CA, FGFR, and RET. Preclinical studies confirmed MET, PIK3CA, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as potential resistance drivers. Alterations of cell-cycle genes were associated with shorter median progression-free survival (PFS, 4.4 vs. 8.8 months, P = 0.01). In 76 patients with progression, osimertinib was continued in 47 cases with a median second PFS (PFS2) of 12.6 months; 21 patients received local consolidation radiation with a median PFS of 15.5 months. Continuation of osimertinib beyond progression was associated with a longer overall survival compared with discontinuation (11.2 vs. 6.1 months, P = 0.02). Conclusions: Osimertinib resistance is associated with diverse, predominantly EGFR-independent genomic alterations. Continuation of osimertinib after progression, alone or in conjunction with radiotherapy, may provide prolonged clinical benefit in selected patients.

In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair-deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair-deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers' tissue of origin.","author":[{"family":"Le","given":"Dung T."},{"family":"Durham","given":"Jennifer N."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kellie N."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Bartlett","given":"Bjarne R."},{"family":"Aulakh","given":"Laveet K."},{"family":"Lu","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Kemberling","given":"Holly"},{"family":"Wilt","given":"Cara"},{"family":"Luber","given":"Brandon S."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Fay"},{"family":"Azad","given":"Nilofer S."},{"family":"Rucki","given":"Agnieszka A."},{"family":"Laheru","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Donehower","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Zaheer","given":"Atif"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"George A."},{"family":"Crocenzi","given":"Todd S."},{"family":"Lee","given":"James J."},{"family":"Greten","given":"Tim F."},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Austin G."},{"family":"Ciombor","given":"Kristen K."},{"family":"Eyring","given":"Aleksandra D."},{"family":"Lam","given":"Bao H."},{"family":"Joe","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Kang","given":"S.

  {"id":"le_poziotinib_2020","abstract":"9514\n\nBackground: Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 mutations is an unmet medical need. Poziotinib is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutants. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of poziotinib in previously treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in an independent cohort of a multi-cohort, multi-center Phase 2 study (ZENITH20-1). Methods: ZENITH20-1 study enrolled pts with advanced NSCLC with an EGFR exon 20 insertion identified on local tissue testing who had received at least one prior line of therapy. Poziotinib (16 mg) was administered orally QD, allowing dose reductions for AEs, with follow up for 24 months. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), evaluated centrally by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Efficacy was also evaluated by specific exon 20 insertions and prior lines of therapy. Results: 115 patients with a median age of 61 years (33-83) were enrolled. Patients had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-9.) The median relative dose intensity was 72% (7-100%) with 65% having dose reductions. The ORR in the as-treated population was 14.8% (95% CI 8.9 - 22.6%), and the DCR was 68.7% (95% CI 59.4 - 77.0%) with a median DoR of 7.4 months. 65% patients had tumor size reductions and the median PFS was 4.2 months. In the evaluable population (n = 88), the ORR was 19.3% and the unconfirmed ORR was 25%. Responses were predominantly observed in insertions between residues M766 to D770 of exon 20 (8/44; 18.2%). Responses were observed in patients with 2 lines (14%); ‚â•3 lines of therapy (16.2%). The most common treatment-related Grade ‚â•3 AEs were rash (28%), diarrhea (26%), stomatitis (9%) and paronychia (6%). The incidence of treatment-related pneumonitis was 4%, however some cases may have been confounded by prior checkpoint inhibitors as first line treatment. Conclusions: Although the ORR primary endpoint was not met, poziotinib induced tumor reduction in the majority of patients with durable responses, including the heavily pre-treated population. Responses were more common in patients with insertions between M766 to D770 of EGFR exon 20. The safety profile was overall consistent with other 2nd generation EGFR TKIs. Evaluation of these subgroups with refined dosing and improved toxicity management to maintain continuous treatment is warranted to assess the potential of poziotinib in Exon20 related tumors.

  {"id":"lee_association_2022","abstract":"Racial and ethnic disparities persist in the incidence and treatment outcomes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, there is a paucity of data describing the genetic basis of these disparities, especially in association with modern ALL molecular taxonomy and in the context of contemporary treatment regimens.To evaluate the association of genetic ancestry with childhood ALL molecular subtypes and outcomes of modern ALL therapy.This multinational, multicenter genetic association study was conducted from March 1, 2000, to November 20, 2020, among 2428 children and adolescents with ALL enrolled in frontline trials from the United States, South East Asia (Singapore and Malaysia), and Latin America (Guatemala), representing diverse populations of European, African, Native American, East Asian, and South Asian descent. Statistical analysis was conducted from February 3, 2020, to April 19, 2021.Molecular subtypes of ALL and genetic ancestry were comprehensively characterized by performing RNA sequencing. Associations of genetic ancestries with ALL molecular subtypes and treatment outcomes were then evaluated.Among the participants in the study, 1340 of 2318 (57.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 7.8 (5.3) years. Of 21 ALL subtypes identified, 8 were associated with ancestry. East Asian ancestry was positively associated with the frequency of somatic DUX4 (odds ratio [OR], 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16-1.45]; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001) and ZNF384 (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.18-1.66]; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001) gene rearrangements and negatively associated with BCR-ABL1‚Äìlike ALL (OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.92]; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.002) and T-cell ALL (OR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.71-0.90]; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001). By contrast, occurrence of CRLF2 rearrangements was associated with Native American ancestry (OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.29-1.69]; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001). When the percentage of Native American ancestry increased, ETV6-RUNX1 fusion became less frequent (OR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70-0.91]; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001), with the opposite trend observed for ETV6-RUNX1‚Äìlike ALL. There was a marked preponderance of T-cell ALL in children of African descent compared with those with a high percentage of Native American ancestry (African: OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.07-1.37]; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.003; Native American: OR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.40-0.67]; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001). African ancestry was also positively associated with the prevalence of TCF3-PBX1 (OR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.25-1.76]; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001) and negatively associated with DUX4 rearrangements (OR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.48-0.93]; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01) and hyperdiploidy (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.68-0.86]; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001). African and Native American ancestries as continuous variables were both associated with poorer event-free survival (for every 25% increase in ancestry: hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.001 for African ancestry; HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.04 for Native American ancestry) and overall survival (for every 25% increase in ancestry: HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01 for African ancestry; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.03 for Native American ancestry). Even after adjusting for biological subtypes and clinical features, Native American and African ancestries remained associated with poor prognosis.This study suggests that ALL molecular subtypes and prognosis are associated with genetic ancestry, potentially pointing to a genetic basis for some of the racial and ethnic disparities in ALL. Therefore, molecular subtype‚Äìdriven treatment individualization is needed to help address racial and ethnic gaps in outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Shawn H.

  {"id":"lee_astct_2018","abstract":"ABSTRACT Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is rapidly emerging as one of the most promising therapies for hematologic malignancies. Two CAR T products were recently approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment ofpatients up to age 25years with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or adults with large B cell lymphoma. Many more CAR T products, as well as other immunotherapies, including various immune cell- and bi-specific antibody-based approaches that function by activation of immune effector cells, are in clinical development for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. These therapies are associated with unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. The assessment and grading of these toxicities vary considerably across clinical trials and across institutions, making it difficult to compare the safety of different products and hindering the ability to develop optimal strategies for management of these toxicities. Moreover, some aspects of these grading systems can be challenging to implement across centers. Therefore, in an effort to harmonize the definitions and grading systems for CRS and neurotoxicity, experts from all aspects of the field met on June 20 and 21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT) in Arlington, VA. Here we report the consensus recommendations of that group and propose new definitions and grading for CRS and neurotoxicity that are objective, easy to apply, and ultimately more accurately categorize the severity of these toxicities. The goal is to provide a uniform consensus grading system for CRS and neurotoxicity associated with immune effector cell therapies, for use across clinical trials and in the postapproval clinical setting.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Santomasso","given":"Bianca"},{"family":"Locke","given":"Frederick L."},{"family":"Ghobadi","given":"Armin"},{"family":"Turtle","given":"Cameron J."},{"family":"Brudno","given":"Jennifer N."},{"family":"Maus","given":"Marcela V."},{"family":"Park","given":"Jae H."},{"family":"Mead","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Pavletic","given":"Steven Z."},{"family":"Go","given":"William Y."},{"family":"Eldjerou","given":"Lamis K."},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Frey","given":"Noelle V."},{"family":"Curran","given":"Kevin J."},{"family":"Peggs","given":"Karl S."},{"family":"Pasquini","given":"Marcelo C."},{"family":"DiPersio","given":"John F."},{"family":"van","given":"den Brink Marcel R.M."},{"family":"Komanduri","given":"Krishna V."},{"family":"Grupp","given":"Stephan A."},{"family":"Neelapu","given":"Sattva S."}],"citation-key":"lee_astct_2018","container-title":"Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","container-title-short":"Biol. blood marrow transplant. : j.

  {"id":"lee_clonal_2017","abstract":"Purpose Histologic transformation of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) into small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been described as one of the major resistant mechanisms for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the molecular pathogenesis is still unclear. Methods We investigated 21 patients with advanced EGFR-mutant LADCs that were transformed into EGFR TKI-resistant SCLCs. Among them, whole genome sequencing was applied for nine tumors acquired at various time points from four patients to reconstruct their clonal evolutionary history and to detect genetic predictors for small-cell transformation. The findings were validated by immunohistochemistry in 210 lung cancer tissues. Results We identified that EGFR TKI-resistant LADCs and SCLCs share a common clonal origin and undergo branched evolutionary trajectories. The clonal divergence of SCLC ancestors from the LADC cells occurred before the first EGFR TKI treatments, and the complete inactivation of both RB1 and TP53 were observed from the early LADC stages in sequenced tumors. We extended the findings by immunohistochemistry in the early-stage LADC tissues of 75 patients treated with EGFR TKIs; inactivation of both Rb and p53 was strikingly more frequent in the small-cell-transformed group than in the nontransformed group (82% v 3%; odds ratio, 131; 95% CI, 19.9 to 859). Among patients registered in a predefined cohort (n = 65), an EGFR mutant LADC that harbored completely inactivated Rb and p53 had a 43ÔøΩ greater risk of small-cell transformation (relative risk, 42.8; 95% CI, 5.88 to 311). Branch-specific mutational signature analysis revealed that apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)-induced hypermutation was frequent in the branches toward small-cell transformation. Conclusion EGFR TKI-resistant SCLCs are branched out early from the LADC clones that harbor completely inactivated RB1 and TP53. The evaluation of RB1 and TP53 status in EGFR TKI-treated LADCs is informative in predicting small-cell transformation.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"June Koo"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Junehawk"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sehui"},{"family":"Kim","given":"So Yeon"},{"family":"Youk","given":"Jeonghwan"},{"family":"Park","given":"Seongyeol"},{"family":"An","given":"Yohan"},{"family":"Keam","given":"Bhumsuk"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dong Wan"},{"family":"Heo","given":"Dae Seog"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Young Tae"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jin-Soo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sehyun"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jong-Seok"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Se-Hoon"},{"family":"Park","given":"Keunchil"},{"family":"Ku","given":"Ja-Lok"},{"family":"Jeon","given":"Yoon Kyung"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Doo Hyun"},{"family":"Park","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Joon"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Tae Min"},{"family":"Ju","given":"Young Seok"}],"citation-key":"lee_clonal_2017","container-title":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"lee_current_2014","abstract":"Abstract\n            As immune-based therapies for cancer become potent, more effective, and more widely available, optimal management of their unique toxicities becomes increasingly important. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially life-threatening toxicity that has been observed following administration of natural and bispecific antibodies and, more recently, following adoptive T-cell therapies for cancer. CRS is associated with elevated circulating levels of several cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon Œ≥, and uncontrolled studies demonstrate that immunosuppression using tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, with or without corticosteroids, can reverse the syndrome. However, because early and aggressive immunosuppression could limit the efficacy of the immunotherapy, current approaches seek to limit administration of immunosuppressive therapy to patients at risk for life-threatening consequences of the syndrome. This report presents a novel system to grade the severity of CRS in individual patients and a treatment algorithm for management of CRS based on severity. The goal of our approach is to maximize the chance for therapeutic benefit from the immunotherapy while minimizing the risk for life threatening complications of CRS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Porter","given":"David L."},{"family":"Louis","given":"Chrystal U."},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Nabil"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Grupp","given":"Stephan A."},{"family":"Mackall","given":"Crystal L."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"lee_current_2014","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2014-05-552729","ISSN":"0006-4971, 1528-0020","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,10]]},"language":"en","page":"188-195","source":"25.476","title":"Current concepts in the diagnosis and management of cytokine release syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/124/2/188/32896/Current-concepts-in-the-diagnosis-and-management","volume":"124"},

Without well-designed studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of continuing anticoagulant therapy beyond the acute treatment period of 3 to 6 months, evidence-based recommendations are lacking. Consensus guidelines generally suggest continuing anticoagulation treatment in patients with active cancer or receiving cancer treatment, with periodic reassessment of the risks and benefits. Unfortunately, with very little published data on the epidemiology of cancer-associated VTE beyond the initial 6 months, it is not possible for clinicians and patients to weigh risks and benefits in a quantitatively informed manner. Further research is needed to provide reliable and contemporary estimates on the risk of recurrent VTE off anticoagulant therapy, risk of bleeding on anticoagulant therapy, case fatality or all-cause mortality, and other important consequences of living with cancer-associated VTE. This chapter provides an overview of the published literature on real-world data on anticoagulant therapy use, the risks and risk factors of recurrent VTE and bleeding, and patient preference and values regarding long-term anticoagulation treatment.

Presented are results of nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab in the Ô¨Årst-line therapy cohort from the phase II CheckMate 142 study. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with no prior treatment in the metastatic setting for MSI-H/dMMR CRC were treated with nivolumab every 2 weeks plus low-dose ipilimumab every 6 weeks until disease progression. The primary end point was objective response rate (investigator assessment; RECIST v1.1).\nRESULTS Median age of treated patients was 66 years (N 5 45). Median follow-up was 29.0 months. Objective response rate and disease control rate were 69% (95% CI, 53 to 82) and 84% (95% CI, 70.5 to 93.5), respectively, with 13% complete response rate. Median duration of response was not reached; 74% of responders had ongoing responses at data cutoff.

We characterized the CMS classification using a novel NanoString gene expression panel on primary CRCs from 581 patients enrolled in this study to assess the prognostic and predictive value of CMSs in these patients.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe CMSs are highly prognostic for overall survival (OS; P < .001) and progression-free survival (PFS; P < .001). Furthermore, CMSs were predictive for both OS (P for interaction < .001) and PFS (P for interaction = .0032). In the CMS1 cohort, patients treated with bevacizumab had a significantly longer OS than those treated with cetuximab (P < .001). In the CMS2 cohort, patients treated with cetuximab had a significantly longer OS than patients treated with bevacizumab (P = .0046).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThese findings highlight the possible clinical utility of CMSs and suggests that refinement of the CMS classification may provide a path toward identifying patients with metastatic CRC who are most likely to benefit from specific targeted therapy as part of the initial treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lenz","given":"Heinz-Josef"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Fang-Shu"},{"family":"Venook","given":"Alan P."},{"family":"Hochster","given":"Howard S."},{"family":"Niedzwiecki","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Richard M."},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Bertagnolli","given":"Monica M."},{"family":"Blanke","given":"Charles D."},{"family":"Zemla","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Qu","given":"Xueping"},{"family":"Wirapati","given":"Pratyaksha"},{"family":"Tejpar","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Innocenti","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Kabbarah","given":"Omar"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"lenz_impact_2019","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.18.02258","ISSN":"0732-183X","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"page":"1876-1885","PMCID":"PMC6675593","PMID":"31042420","publisher":"Wolters Kluwer","source":"45.3","title":"Impact of Consensus Molecular Subtype on Survival in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Results From CALGB/SWOG 80405 (Alliance)","title-short":"Impact of Consensus Molecular Subtype on Survival in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.18.02258","volume":"37"},

Despite the documented efficacy of osimertinib in first- and second-line settings, patients inevitably develop resistance, with no further clear-cut therapeutic options to date other than chemotherapy and locally ablative therapy for selected individuals. On account of the high degree of tumour heterogeneity and adaptive cellular signalling pathways in NSCLC, the acquired osimertinib resistance is highly heterogeneous, encompassing EGFR-dependent as well as EGFR-independent mechanisms. Furthermore, data from repeat plasma genotyping analyses have highlighted differences in the frequency and preponderance of resistance mechanisms when osimertinib is administered in a front-line versus second-line setting, underlying the discrepancies in selection pressure and clonal evolution. This review summarises the molecular mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including MET/HER2 amplification, activation of the RASÔøΩ¢ò´itogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or RASÔøΩ¢ñØhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, novel fusion events and histological/phenotypic transformation, as well as discussing the current evidence regarding potential new approaches to counteract osimertinib resistance.","author":[{"family":"Leonetti","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Sugandhi"},{"family":"Minari","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Perego","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Giovannetti","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Tiseo","given":"Marcello"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"leonetti_resistance_2019","container-title":"British journal of cancer","container-title-short":"Br.

At the same time, ongoing consumption of platelets and coagulation proteins results in thrombocytopenia and low concentrations of clotting factors, which may cause profuse hemorrhagic complications. DIC is always secondary to an underlying condition, such as severe infections, solid or hematologic malignancies, trauma, or obstetric calamities. A reliable diagnosis of DIC can be made through simple scoring algorithms based on readily available routine hemostatic parameters. The cornerstone of supportive treatment of this coagulopathy is management of the underlying condition. Additionally, administration of heparin may be useful, and restoration of physiological anticoagulants has been suggested, but has not been proven successful in improving clinically relevant outcomes so far.

We aim to synthesize existing literature that compared DOACs versus LMWHs in this high-risk population. Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic review using EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL for all observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (PROSPERO: CRD42017080898). Two authors independently reviewed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed bias. Primary outcomes included 6-month recurrent VTE and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) and mortality.\nResults: We screened 426 articles, reviewed 25 in full-text, and selected 13 and 2 for qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Based on a meta-analysis of the 2 RCTs, DOACs had lower 6-month recurrent VTE (42/ 725) when compared to LMWH (64/727) (RR: 0.65 (0.42‚Äì1.01)). However, DOACs had higher major bleeding (40/725) when compared to LMWH (23/727) (RR 1.74 (1.05‚Äì2.88)). Similarly, CRNMB was higher (RR 2.31 (0.85‚Äì6.28)) for patients receiving DOACs. There was no diÔ¨Äerence in mortality (RR 1.03 (0.85‚Äì1.26)). Observational studies were heterogeneous with high risks of bias but showed recurrent VTE rates consistent with the meta-analysis.\nConclusions: DOACs were more eÔ¨Äective than LMWHs to prevent recurrent VTE but were associated with a signiÔ¨Åcantly increased risk of major bleeding as well as a trend toward more CRNMB. The absolute risk differences were small (2‚Äì3%) for both primary outcomes and may reÔ¨Çect better compliance with DOACs than LMWHs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Ang"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"David A."},{"family":"Lyman","given":"Gary H."},{"family":"Carrier","given":"Marc"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"li_direct_2019","container-title":"Thrombosis Research","container-title-short":"Thrombosis Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.thromres.2018.02.144","ISSN":"00493848","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","page":"158-163","source":"10.407","title":"Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) versus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for treatment of cancer associated thrombosis (CAT): A systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) versus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for treatment of cancer associated thrombosis (CAT)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049384818302160","volume":"173"},
  {"id":"li_genomewide_2021","abstract":"Clinicopathological evidence supports endometrial atypical hyperplasia (AH) or endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia as the precursor of uterine endometrioid carcinoma (EC), the most common gynecologic malignancy. However, the pathogenic progression from AH to EC remains unclear. Here, we employed whole-exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations and copy number changes in micro-dissected lesions from 30 pairs of newly diagnosed AH and EC. We found that all but one pair of AHs shared the same DNA mismatch repair status as their corresponding ECs. The percentage of common mutations between AH lesions and corresponding ECs varied significantly, ranging from 0.1% to 82%. Microsatellite stable AHs had fewer cancer driver mutations than ECs (5 versus 7, p = 0.017), but among microsatellite unstable AHs and ECs there was no difference in mutational numbers (36 versus 38, p = 0.65). As compared to AH specimens, 19 (79%) of 24 microsatellite stable EC tumors gained new cancer driver mutations, most of which involved PTEN, ARID1A, PIK3CA, CTNNB1, or CHD4. Our results suggest that some AH lesions are the immediate precursor of ECs, and progression depends on acquisition of additional cancer driver mutations. However, a complex clonal relationship between AH and EC can also be appreciated, as in some cases both lesions diverge very early or arise independently, thus co-developing with distinct genetic trajectories. Our genome-wide profile of mutations in AH and EC shines new light on the molecular landscape of tumor progression. ¬© 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

TCR-T cell therapy is another active field of cellular immunotherapy for cancer.\nMETHODS: We previously developed a human anti-CD19 antibody (ET190L1) and generated novel CD19-specific Œ≥/Œ¥ TCR-T cells, ET019003, by fusing the Fab fragment of ET190L1 with Œ≥/Œ¥ TCR constant chain plus adding an ET190L1-scFv/CD28 co-stimulatory molecule. ET019003 cells were tested in preclinical studies followed by a phase 1 clinical trial.\nRESULTS: ET019003 cells produced less cytokines but retained comparable antitumor potency than ET190L1-CAR-T cells in vivo and in vitro. In the first-in-human trial, eight patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were treated. CRS of grade 1 was observed in three (37.5%) patients; ICANS of grade 3 was noted in one (12.5%) patient. Elevation of serum cytokines after ET019003 infusion was almost modest. With a median follow-up of 34 (range 6-38) months, seven (87.5%) patients attained clinical responses and six (75%) achieved complete responses (CR). OS, PFS and DOR at 3¬†years were 75.0%, 62.5%, and 71.4%, respectively. Notably, patient 1 with primary CNS lymphoma did not experience CRS or ICANS and got an ongoing CR for over 3¬†years after infusion, with detectable ET019003 cells in CSF. ET019003 showed striking in vivo expansion and persisted in 50% of patients at 12¬†months. Three patients received a second infusion, one for consolidation therapy after CR and two for salvage therapy after disease progression, but no response was observed. ET019003 expansion was striking in the first infusion, but poor in the second infusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: CD19-specific Œ≥/Œ¥ TCR-T cells, ET019003, had a good safety profile and could induce rapid responses and durable CR in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, even primary CNS lymphoma, presenting a novel and potent therapeutic option for these patients.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04014894.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Chenggong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Fen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Du","given":"Mengyi"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Wenjing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yinqiang"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Huiwen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Kou","given":"Haiming"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Danying"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jianghua"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Qiuzhe"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Sha"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Mei","given":"Heng"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Yu"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"li_novel_2023","container-title":"Journal of Hematology & Oncology","container-title-short":"J Hematol Oncol","DOI":"10.1186/s13045-023-01402-y","ISSN":"1756-8722","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"5","PMCID":"PMC9862812","PMID":"36681817","source":"23.168","title":"Novel CD19-specific Œ≥/Œ¥ TCR-T cells in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"liang_can_2023","abstract":"Expert feedback lays the foundation of rigorous research. However, the rapid growth of scholarly production and intricate knowledge specialization challenge the conventional scientific feedback mechanisms. High-quality peer reviews are increasingly difficult to obtain. Researchers who are more junior or from under-resourced settings have especially hard times getting timely feedback. With the breakthrough of large language models (LLM) such as GPT-4, there is growing interest in using LLMs to generate scientific feedback on research manuscripts. However, the utility of LLM-generated feedback has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we created an automated pipeline using GPT-4 to provide comments on the full PDFs of scientific papers. We evaluated the quality of GPT-4's feedback through two large-scale studies. We first quantitatively compared GPT-4's generated feedback with human peer reviewer feedback in 15 Nature family journals (3,096 papers in total) and the ICLR machine learning conference (1,709 papers). The overlap in the points raised by GPT-4 and by human reviewers (average overlap 30.85% for Nature journals, 39.23% for ICLR) is comparable to the overlap between two human reviewers (average overlap 28.58% for Nature journals, 35.25% for ICLR). The overlap between GPT-4 and human reviewers is larger for the weaker papers. We then conducted a prospective user study with 308 researchers from 110 US institutions in the field of AI and computational biology to understand how researchers perceive feedback generated by our GPT-4 system on their own papers. Overall, more than half (57.4%) of the users found GPT-4 generated feedback helpful/very helpful and 82.4% found it more beneficial than feedback from at least some human reviewers. While our findings show that LLM-generated feedback can help researchers, we also identify several limitations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Liang","given":"Weixin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuhui"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Hancheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Binglu"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Daisy"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Vodrahalli","given":"Kailas"},{"family":"He","given":"Siyu"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Yian"},{"family":"McFarland","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Zou","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"liang_can_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2310.01783","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,3]]},"number":"arXiv:2310.01783","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Can large language models provide useful feedback on research papers?

  {"id":"lim_abstract_2021","abstract":"Background: EGFR-activating mutations (L858R and ex19del) are major drivers (15-47%) of lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR TKI development has changed the treatment paradigm for EGFR-mutant (EGFR+) NSCLC. However, tumors often develop acquired resistance mutations to current TKIs leading to clinical progression. EGFR+/T790M is the most prevalent acquired resistance mutation after first- and second-generation TKI treatment. Osimertinib, a third-generation TKI which targets EGFR+/T790M, can overcome this resistance, but faces further resistance within 10-18 months. EGFR+/C797S is the most significant on-target resistance mechanism to osimertinib, leading to EGFR+/T790M/C797S double resistant mutants. There are currently no approved targeted therapies for patients with EGFR+/T790M/C797S NSCLC. BLU-945 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the EGFR+/T790M/C797S and EGFR+/T790M mutations, with in vivo activity in subcutaneous and intracranial EGFR-mutant tumor models. Method: In vivo antitumor activity of BLU-945 was evaluated in engineered triple mutant cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models and osimertinib-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NSCLC. Plasma and tumor samples were collected for future pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. In vivo activity was also evaluated in an intracranial implantation model using luciferase-expressing YU-1097 patient-derived-cells harboring EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S resistance mutations, with the tumor burden of intracranial lesions measured by bioluminescence imaging. Results: Oral administration of BLU-945 to tumor-bearing mice showed potent EGFR pathway inhibition and significant single-agent antitumor activity at well-tolerated doses in the engineered osimertinib-resistant EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S CDX model, and an EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S PDX model. In addition, combination of BLU-945 with osimertinib showed enhanced antitumor activity compared with single-agent treatment in the EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S PDX model. Pharmacodynamic assays revealed treatment with BLU-945 resulted in marked inhibition of EGFR, AKT and ERK phosphorylation in the EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S CDX and EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S PDX models. BLU-945 also demonstrated potent activity in a patient-derived model of EGFRex19del/T790M/C797S implanted intracranially. Conclusion: BLU-945 is a potent, selective, and orally available fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor with robust antitumor activity in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC models grown subcutaneously and intracranially. BLU-945 shows activity as a single agent and in combination with other EGFR inhibitors. Clinical development of BLU-945 is expected in 2021.

  {"id":"lin_efficacy_2019","abstract":"Abstract Introduction The current standard initial therapy for advanced ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)ÔøΩ¢ñØositive NSCLC is a second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as alectinib. The optimal next-line therapy after failure of a second-generation ALK TKI remains to be established; however, standard options include the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib or platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. The efficacy of platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy has not been evaluated in cases that are refractory to second-generation TKIs. Methods This was a retrospective study performed at three institutions. Patients were eligible if they had advanced ALK-positive NSCLC refractory to one or more second-generation ALK TKI(s) and had received platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Results Among 58 patients eligible for this study, 37 had scans evaluable for response with measurable disease at baseline. The confirmed objective response rate to platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy was 29.7% (11 of 37 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.9% ÔøΩÔøΩ 47.0%), with median duration of response of 6.4 months (95% CI: 1.6 months ÔøΩÔøΩ not reached). The median progression-free survival for the entire cohort was 4.3 months (95% CI: 2.9 ÔøΩÔøΩ 5.8 months). Progression-free survival was longer in patients who received platinum/pemetrexed in combination with an ALK TKI compared to those who received platinum/pemetrexed alone (6.8 months vs. 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.33; p = 0.025). Conclusions Platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy shows modest efficacy in ALK-positive NSCLC after failure of second-generation ALK TKIs. The activity may be higher if administered with an ALK TKI, suggesting a potential role for continued ALK inhibition.","author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Jessica J."},{"family":"Schoenfeld","given":"Adam J."},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Viola W."},{"family":"Yeap","given":"Beow Y."},{"family":"Chin","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Rooney","given":"Marguerite"},{"family":"Plodkowski","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Digumarthy","given":"Subba R."},{"family":"Dagogo-Jack","given":"Ibiayi"},{"family":"Gainor","given":"Justin F."},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"Riely","given":"Gregory J."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."}],"citation-key":"lin_efficacy_2019","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"lin_impact_2018","abstract":"Purpose\n\nAdvanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion-positive non‚Äìsmall-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are effectively treated with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the molecular basis for this association is unknown.\n\nPatients and Methods\n\nWe identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined.\n\nResults\n\nThe most frequent ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43%) and variant 3 in 51 patients (40%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57% v 30%; P = .023). In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32% v 0%; P < .001). Analysis of the Foundation Medicine database revealed similar associations of variant 3 with ALK resistance mutation and with G1202R (P = .010 and .015, respectively). Among patients treated with the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib, variant 3 was associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival than variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79; P = .011).\n\nConclusion\n\nSpecific ALK variants may be associated with the development of ALK resistance mutations, particularly G1202R, and provide a molecular link between variant and clinical outcome.

Understanding the biological underpinnings of TKI resistance is key to the successful development of future therapeutic strategies. Traditionally, mechanisms of TKI resistance have been viewed under a dichotomous lens. Tumor cells are TKI-sensitive or TKI-refractory, exhibit intrinsic or acquired resistance, and accumulate alterations within or outside the target to promote their survival. Such classifications facilitate our comprehension of an otherwise complex biology, but are likely an oversimplification. Recent studies underscore the multifaceted, genetically heterogeneous nature of TKI resistance, which evolves dynamically with changes in therapy.

The DLS distinguishes between 26 common skin conditions, representing 80% of cases seen in primary care, while also providing a secondary prediction covering 419 skin conditions. On 963 validation cases, where a rotating panel of three board-certified dermatologists defined the reference standard, the DLS was non-inferior to six other dermatologists and superior to six primary care physicians (PCPs) and six nurse practitioners (NPs) (top-1 accuracy: 0.66 DLS, 0.63 dermatologists, 0.44 PCPs and 0.40 NPs). These results highlight the potential of the DLS to assist general practitioners in diagnosing skin conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Ayush"},{"family":"Eng","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Way","given":"David H."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Bui","given":"Peggy"},{"family":"Kanada","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Oliveira Marinho","given":"Guilherme","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Gallegos","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Gabriele","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Vishakha"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Nalini"},{"family":"Natarajan","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"Hofmann-Wellenhof","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Corrado","given":"Greg S."},{"family":"Peng","given":"Lily H."},{"family":"Webster","given":"Dale R."},{"family":"Ai","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Susan J."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Dunn","given":"R.

  {"id":"liu_how_2019","abstract":"In recent years, many new clinical diagnostic tools have been developed using complicated machine learning methods. Irrespective of how a diagnostic tool is derived, it must be evaluated using a 3-step process of deriving, validating, and establishing the clinical effectiveness of the tool. Machine learning‚Äìbased tools should also be assessed for the type of machine learning model used and its appropriateness for the input data type and data set size. Machine learning models also generally have additional prespecified settings called hyperparameters, which must be tuned on a data set independent of the validation set. On the validation set, the outcome against which the model is evaluated is termed the reference standard. The rigor of the reference standard must be assessed, such as against a universally accepted gold standard or expert grading.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Po-Hsuan Cameron"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Lily"}],"citation-key":"liu_how_2019","container-title":"JAMA","container-title-short":"JAMA","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2019.16489","ISSN":"0098-7484","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,12]]},"page":"1806-1816","PMID":"31714992","source":"Silverchair","title":"How to Read Articles That Use Machine Learning: Users‚Äô Guides to the Medical Literature","title-short":"How to Read Articles That Use Machine Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2019.16489","volume":"322"},
  {"id":"liu_reporting_2020","abstract":"The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomized trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials‚ÄìArtificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials‚ÄìArtificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human‚ÄìAI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaoxuan"},{"family":"Cruz Rivera","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Moher","given":"David"},{"family":"Calvert","given":"Melanie J."},{"family":"Denniston","given":"Alastair K."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"liu_reporting_2020","container-title":"Nature Medicine","container-title-short":"Nat Med","DOI":"10.1038/s41591-020-1034-x","ISSN":"1546-170X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"9","page":"1364-1374","PMCID":"PMC7598943","PMID":"32908283","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"87.241","title":"Reporting guidelines for clinical trial reports for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the CONSORT-AI extension","title-short":"Reporting guidelines for clinical trial reports for interventions involving artificial intelligence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1034-x","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"liusie_mitigating_2023","abstract":"Prompt-based classifiers are an attractive approach for zero-shot classification. However, the precise choice of the prompt template and label words can largely influence performance, with semantically equivalent settings often showing notable performance difference. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to word biases, where the classifier may be biased towards classes. To address this problem, it is possible to optimise classification thresholds on a labelled data set, however, this mitigates some of the advantages of prompt-based classifiers. This paper instead approaches this problem by examining the expected marginal probabilities of the classes. Here, probabilities are reweighted to have a uniform prior over classes, in an unsupervised fashion. Further, we draw a theoretical connection between the class priors and the language models' word prior, and offer the ability to set a threshold in a zero-resource fashion. We show that matching class priors correlates strongly with the oracle upper bound performance and demonstrate large consistent performance gains for prompt settings over a range of NLP tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Liusie","given":"Adian"},{"family":"Manakul","given":"Potsawee"},{"family":"Gales","given":"Mark J.

  {"id":"locatelli_how_2015","abstract":"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a unique, aggressive hematopoietic disorder of infancy/early childhood caused by excessive proliferation of cells of monocytic and granulocytic lineages. Approximately 90% of patients carry either somatic or germline mutations of PTPN-11, K-RAS, N-RAS, CBL, or NF1 in their leukemic cells. These genetic aberrations are largely mutually exclusive and activate the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the therapy of choice for most patients with JMML, curing more than 50% of affected children. We recommend that this option be promptly offered to any child with PTPN-11-, K-RAS-, or NF1-mutated JMML and to the majority of those with N-RAS mutations. Because children with CBL mutations and few of those with N-RAS mutations may have spontaneous resolution of hematologic abnormalities, the decision to proceed to transplantation in these patients must be weighed carefully. Disease recurrence remains the main cause of treatment failure after HSCT. A second allograft is recommended if overt JMML relapse occurs after transplantation. Recently, azacytidine, a hypomethylating agent, was reported to induce hematologic/molecular remissions in some children with JMML, and its role in both reducing leukemia burden before HSCT and in nontransplant settings requires further studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Locatelli","given":"Franco"},{"family":"Niemeyer","given":"Charlotte M."}],"citation-key":"locatelli_how_2015","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2014-08-550483","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1083-1090","source":"Silverchair","title":"How I treat juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2014-08-550483","volume":"125"},

The primary endpoints were safety for phase 1 and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response for phase 2, and key secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response. Pre-planned activity and safety analyses were done per protocol. ZUMA-1 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT02348216 . Although the registrational cohorts are closed, the trial remains open, and recruitment to extension cohorts with alternative endpoints is underway. Findings Between May 19, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 119 patients were enrolled and 108 received axicabtagene ciloleucel across phases 1 and 2.

From 1997 to 2018, we identified 307 adults (‚â•18 years old) and 9 children (209 males, 107 females; P¬†&lt; .001) with both an HLH-related diagnosis and malignant disease, corresponding to 0.19 per 100‚Äâ000 adults annually (0.15/100‚Äâ000 for the entire population), increasing from 0.026 (1997-2007) to 0.34 (2008-2018) (P¬†&lt; .001). In the latest 7-year period (2012-2018), the annual incidence was 0.45 per 100‚Äâ000 adults (n¬†= 246). This incidence varied between the 6 health care regions in Sweden, from 0.18 to 0.71 (Region Stockholm) per 100‚Äâ000 adults annually (P¬†&lt; .001), likely due to variable awareness. Mal-HLH was reported in 0.6% of all hematological malignancies, with the highest proportion (2.5%) in young males. Among the 316 patients, the 1-month probability of survival, likely representing the HLH episode, increased significantly from 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40-63) (1997-2007) to 71% (95% CI, 65-76) (2008-2018), whereas 2-year survival remained poor (25%; 95% CI, 20-30). Altogether, 52% were lymphomas, 29% leukemias, 8% other hematological malignancies, and 11% solid tumors. Males were more affected than females by mal-HLH, also taking the over-representation of males with hematological malignancies into account (P¬†= .0012). Validation by medical-file reviews revealed 13% over-reporting of HLH. We conclude that the annual mal-HLH incidence has increased 10-fold and was at least 0.71 per 100‚Äâ000 adults from 2012 to 2018, that is, 0.62 per 100‚Äâ000 adults considering 13% estimated HLH over-reporting, and that early survival improved significantly, likely due to increased awareness and more HLH-directed therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"L√∂fstedt","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"J√§dersten","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Meeths","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Henter","given":"Jan-Inge"}],"citation-key":"lofstedt_malignancyassociated_2024","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2023020715","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,18]]},"language":"en","page":"233-242","source":"Silverchair","title":"Malignancy-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in sweden: incidence, clinical characteristics, and survival","title-short":"Malignancy-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in Sweden","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2023020715","volume":"143"},
  {"id":"loibl_breast_2021","abstract":"Breast cancer is still the most common cancer worldwide. But the way breast cancer is viewed has changed drastically since its molecular hallmarks were extensively characterised, now including immunohistochemical markers (eg, ER, PR, HER2 [ERBB2], and proliferation marker protein Ki-67 [MKI67]), genomic markers (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, and PIK3CA), and immunomarkers (eg, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1). New biomarker combinations are the basis for increasingly complex diagnostic algorithms. Neoadjuvant combination therapy, often including targeted agents, is a standard of care (especially in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer), and the basis for de-escalation of surgery in the breast and axilla and for risk-adapted post-neoadjuvant strategies. Radiotherapy remains an important cornerstone of breast cancer therapy, but de-escalation schemes have become the standard of care. ER-positive tumours are treated with 5-10 years of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, based on an individual risk assessment. For metastatic breast cancer, standard therapy options include targeted approaches such as CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, depending on tumour type and molecular profile. This range of treatment options reflects the complexity of breast cancer therapy today.","author":[{"family":"Loibl","given":"Sibylle"},{"family":"Poortmans","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Morrow","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Denkert","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Curigliano","given":"Giuseppe"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"loibl_breast_2021","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32381-3","ISSN":"1474-547X","issue":"10286","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,8]]},"language":"en","page":"1750-1769","PMID":"33812473","source":"202.731","title":"Breast cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673620323813","volume":"397"},

  {"id":"lovly_rationale_2014","abstract":"Crizotinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), shows marked activity in patients whose lung cancers harbor fusions in the gene encoding anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), but its efficacy is limited by variable primary responses and acquired resistance. In work arising from the clinical observation of a patient with ALK fusion-positive lung cancer who had an exceptional response to an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)-specific antibody, we define a therapeutic synergism between ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors. Similar to IGF-1R, ALK fusion proteins bind to the adaptor insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and IRS-1 knockdown enhances the antitumor effects of ALK inhibitors. In models of ALK TKI resistance, the IGF-1R pathway is activated, and combined ALK and IGF-1R inhibition improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with this finding, the levels of IGF-1R and IRS-1 are increased in biopsy samples from patients progressing on crizotinib monotherapy. Collectively these data support a role for the IGF-1R-IRS-1 pathway in both ALK TKI-sensitive and ALK TKI-resistant states and provide a biological rationale for further clinical development of dual ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors.","author":[{"family":"Lovly","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Nerina T."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Ortiz-Cuaran","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Heukamp","given":"Lukas C."},{"family":"Yan","given":"Yingjun"},{"family":"Florin","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"OzretiÔøΩ","given":"Luka"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Pengcheng"},{"family":"Paik","given":"Paul K."},{"family":"Shen","given":"Ronglai"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Hailing"},{"family":"Buettner","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"AnsÁüán","given":"Sascha"},{"family":"Perner","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Brockmann","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"JÁæπrgen"},{"family":"Gardizi","given":"Masyar"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Gavin M."},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Prudence A."},{"family":"Rogers","given":"Toni Maree"},{"family":"Suehara","given":"Yoshiyuki"},{"family":"Red-Brewer","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Tieu","given":"Rudy"},{"family":"de","given":"Stanchina Elisa"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qingguo"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zhongming"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"David H."},{"family":"Horn","given":"Leora"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Kwok-Kin"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Roman K."},{"family":"Ladanyi","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Pao","given":"William"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"lovly_rationale_2014","container-title":"Nature medicine","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"lyell_automation_2017","abstract":"Introduction: While potentially reducing decision errors, decision support systems can introduce new types of errors. Automation bias (AB) happens when users become overreliant on decision support, which reduces vigilance in information seeking and processing. Most research originates from the human factors literature, where the prevailing view is that AB occurs only in multitasking environments.Objectives: This review seeks to compare the human factors and health care literature, focusing on the apparent association of AB with multitasking and task complexity.Data sources: EMBASE, Medline, Compendex, Inspec, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Business Source Premiere from 1983 to 2015.Study selection: Evaluation studies where task execution was assisted by automation and resulted in errors were included. Participants needed to be able to verify automation correctness and perform the task manually.Methods: Tasks were identified and grouped. Task and automation type and presence of multitasking were noted. Each task was rated for its verification complexity.Results: Of 890 papers identified, 40 met the inclusion criteria; 6 were in health care. Contrary to the prevailing human factors view, AB was found in single tasks, typically involving diagnosis rather than monitoring, and with high verification complexity.Limitations: The literature is fragmented, with large discrepancies in how AB is reported. Few studies reported the statistical significance of AB compared to a control condition.Conclusion: AB appears to be associated with the degree of cognitive load experienced in decision tasks, and appears to not be uniquely associated with multitasking. Strategies to minimize AB might focus on cognitive load reduction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lyell","given":"David"},{"family":"Coiera","given":"Enrico"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"lyell_automation_2017","container-title":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","container-title-short":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","DOI":"10.1093/jamia/ocw105","ISSN":"1067-5027","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"423-431","PMCID":"PMC7651899","PMID":"27516495","source":"7.942","title":"Automation bias and verification complexity: a systematic review","title-short":"Automation bias and verification complexity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocw105","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"lyman_morbidity_2018","abstract":"Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer.\nMethods: Hospitalization data reported on adult cancer patients at US medical centers between 1995 and 2012 were analyzed. Cancer diagnosis, presence of VTE, comorbidities, and infectious complications were based on ICD-9-CM codes.\nResults: Nearly six million hospitalizations of 3,146,388 individual patients with cancer were reported with VTE observed in 8.4%. A single hospitalization was randomly selected for each patient with VTE diagnosed in 166,537 (5.3%) of evaluated admissions. In-hospital mortality was observed in 5.5% of patients without a VTE diagnosis and in 15.0% of those with VTE including 19.4% with a pulmonary embolism. While rates of VTE increased from 3.5% in 1995 to 6.5% in 2012, no signiÔ¨Åcant reported changes in VTE imaging, length of stay (LOS) or intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were observed and mortality decreased by one-third. VTE was reported in 5.2%, 5.8% and 5.4% of patients with solid tumors, lymphoma, and leukemia, respectively. Rates of VTE were greatest among patients with pancreatic, gastric or other abdominal malignancies as well as those with ovarian, lung and esophageal cancers. The risk of VTE increased progressively from 2.3% in those with no comorbidities to over 11% in those with ‚â•3 major comorbidities. The strongest risk factors for VTE were infectious complications including sepsis, invasive candidiasis, pneumonia and IV line infections. Average costs per hospitalization adjusted to 2015 dollars for patients without and with VTE were $19,994 and $37,352, respectively.\nConclusions: VTE among hospitalized patients with cancer has increased signiÔ¨Åcantly with a major impact on hospital mortality and costs. Patients with major medical comorbidities and infectious complications are at particularly high risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Lyman","given":"Gary H."},{"family":"Culakova","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Poniewierski","given":"Marek S."},{"family":"Kuderer","given":"Nicole M."}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"lyman_morbidity_2018","container-title":"Thrombosis Research","container-title-short":"Thrombosis Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.thromres.2018.01.028","ISSN":"00493848","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"language":"en","page":"S112-S118","source":"10.407","title":"Morbidity, mortality and costs associated with venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049384818300367","volume":"164"},

The functional consequences of identified mutations were evaluated after the mutant proteins were expressed in cultured cells. RESULTS Somatic mutations were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene in eight of nine patients with gefitinib-responsive lung cancer, as compared with none of the seven patients with no response (P<0.001). Mutations were either small, in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions clustered around the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain. Similar mutations were detected in tumors from 2 of 25 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer who had not been exposed to gefitinib (8 percent). All mutations were heterozygous, and identical mutations were observed in multiple patients, suggesting an additive specific gain of function. In vitro, EGFR mutants demonstrated enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in response to epidermal growth factor and increased sensitivity to inhibition by gefitinib. CONCLUSIONS A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor. Screening for such mutations in lung cancers may identify patients who will have a response to gefitinib.","author":[{"family":"Lynch","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Bell","given":"Daphne W."},{"family":"Sordella","given":"Raffaella"},{"family":"Gurubhagavatula","given":"Sarada"},{"family":"Okimoto","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Brannigan","given":"Brian W."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Patricia L."},{"family":"Haserlat","given":"Sara M."},{"family":"Supko","given":"Jeffrey G."},{"family":"Haluska","given":"Frank G."},{"family":"Louis","given":"David N."},{"family":"Christiani","given":"David C."},{"family":"Settleman","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Haber","given":"Daniel A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"lynch_activating_2004","container-title":"The New England journal of medicine","container-title-short":"N.

The initial phase of this ongoing multicenter, community-based, open-label study evaluated three alternative AZA dosing schedules without weekend dosing. Patients and Methods MDS patients were randomly assigned to one of three regimens every 4 weeks for six cycles: AZA 5-2-2 (75 mg/m 2 /d subcutaneously for 5 days, followed by 2 days no treatment, then 75 mg/m 2 /d for 2 days); AZA 5-2-5 (50 mg/m 2 /d subcutaneously for 5 days, followed by 2 days no treatment, then 50 mg/m 2 /d for 5 days); or AZA 5 (75 mg/m 2 /d subcutaneously for 5 days). Results Of patients randomly assigned to AZA 5-2-2 (n 50), AZA 5-2-5 (n 51), or AZA 5 (n 50), most were French-American-British (FAB) lower risk (refractory anemia [RA]/RA with ringed sideroblasts/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with 5% bone marrow blasts, 63%) or RA with excess blasts (30%), and 79 (52%) completed six treatment cycles. Hematologic improvement (HI) was achieved by 44% (22 of 50), 45% (23 of 51), and 56% (28 of 50) of AZA 5-2-2, AZA 5-2-5, and AZA 5 arms, respectively. Proportions of RBC transfusion‚Äì dependent patients who achieved transfusion independence were 50% (12 of 24), 55% (12 of 22), and 64% (16 of 25), and of FAB lower-risk transfusion-dependent patients were 53% (nine of 17), 50% (six of 12), and 61% (11 of 18), respectively. In the AZA 5-2-2, AZA 5-2-5, and AZA 5 groups, 84%, 77%, and 58%, respectively, experienced 1 grade 3 to 4 adverse events.

  {"id":"m_geriatric_2022","abstract":"Given that there are only a few prospective studies with conflicting results, we investigated the prognostic value of multiparameter geriatric assessment (GA) domains on tolerance and outcomes after intensive chemotherapy in older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In all, 105 newly diagnosed patients with AML who were older than age¬†60 years and who received intensive chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine and idarubicin were enrolled prospectively. Pretreatment GA included evaluations for social and nutritional support, cognition, depression, distress, and physical function. The median age was 64 years (range, 60-75 years), and 93% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score &lt;2. Between 32.4% and 69.5% of patients met the criteria for impairment for each domain of GA. Physical impairment by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and cognitive dysfunction by the Mini-Mental State Examination in the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (CERAD) Assessment Packet (MMSE-KC) were significantly associated with nonfatal toxicities, including grade 3 to 4 infections (SPPB, P = .024; MMSE-KC, P = .044), acute renal failure (SPPB, P = .013), and/or prolonged hospitalization (‚â•40 days) during induction chemotherapy (MMSE-KC, P = .005). Reduced physical function by SPPB and depressive symptoms by the Korean version of the short form of geriatric depression scales (SGDS-K) were significantly associated with inferior survival (SPPB, P = .027; SGDS-K, P = .048). Gait speed and sit-and-stand speed were the most powerful measurements for predicting survival outcomes. Notably, the addition of SPPB and SGDS-K, gait speed and SGDS-K, or sit-and-stand speed and SGDS-K significantly improved the power of existing survival prediction models. In conclusion, GA improved risk stratification for treatment decisions and may inform interventions to improve outcomes for older adults with AML.

  {"id":"m_international_2014","abstract":"Introduction: The goal of personalized medicine is to treat patients with a therapy predicted to be efficacious based on the molecular characteristics of the tumor, thereby sparing the patient futile or toxic therapy. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors are effective against ALK-positive nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors, but to date the only approved companion diagnostic is a break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a clinically applicable cost-effective test that is sensitive and specific for ALK protein expression. The purpose of this study was to assemble an international team of expert pathologists to evaluate a new automated standardized ALK IHC assay. Methods: Archival NSCLC tumor specimens ( n =103) previously tested for ALK rearrangement by FISH were provided by the international collaborators. These specimens were stained by IHC with the anti-ALK (D5F3) primary antibody combined with OptiView DAB IHC detection and OptiView amplification (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ). Specimens were scored binarily as positive if strong granular cytoplasmic brown staining was present in tumor cells. IHC results were compared with the FISH results and interevaluator comparisons made. Results: Overall for the 100 evaluable cases the ALK IHC assay was highly sensitive (90%), specific (95%), and accurate relative (93%) to the ALK FISH results. Similar results were observed using a majority score. IHC negativity was scored by seven of seven and six of seven evaluators on three and two FISH-positive cases, respectively. IHC positivity was scored on two FISH-negative cases by seven of seven readers. There was agreement among seven of seven and six of seven readers on 88% and 96% of the cases before review, respectively, and after review there was agreement among seven of seven and six of seven on 95% and 97% of the cases, respectively. Conclusions: On the basis of expert evaluation the ALK IHC test is sensitive, specific, and accurate, and a majority score of multiple readers does not improve these results over an individual reader's score. Excellent inter-reader agreement was observed. These data support the algorithmic use of ALK IHC in the evaluation of NSCLC.","author":[{"family":"M","given":"urry W."},{"family":"S","given":"holl Lynette M."},{"family":"D","given":"ietel Manfred"},{"family":"S","given":"chuuring Ed"},{"family":"T","given":"sao Ming-Sound"},{"family":"Y","given":"atabe Yasushi"},{"family":"T","given":"ubbs Raymond R."},{"family":"H","given":"irsch Fred R.

  {"id":"m_multicenter_2014","abstract":"Introduction Detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-gene rearrangements in nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is mainly performed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). The question was raised if FISH might be replaced by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a reliable and reproducible manner across different laboratories. Methods After calibration of the staining instruments and training of the observers to binary interpretation (positive versus negative), 15 NSCLC were independently tested for ALK protein expression by IHC only in a multicenter setting (16 institutes). Each laboratory utilized the VENTANA ALK-D5F3 IHC assay. As demonstrated by FISH the samples displayed unequivocal ALK break-positivity (6ÔøΩ) and negativity (7ÔøΩ), as well as ALK positive-\"borderline\" character (2ÔøΩ), which is challenging for FISH diagnosis and thus was RT-PCR-confirmed. Results All seven ALK FISH-negative cases were homogenously scored as ALK-IHC negative. All 16 participants scored the two ALK positive-\"borderline\" samples as unequivocally positive according to their protein expression. Concordant IHC interpretation was also noticed in four of six unequivocal ALK break positive cases. In two of six some observers described a weak/heterogeneous ALK-IHC staining. This would have resulted in a subsequent ALK-testing (FISH/PCR) in a routine diagnostic setting. Conclusions This so-called \"ALK-Harmonization-Study\" shows for the first time that predictive semiquantitative IHC reveals reliable and reproducible results across several labs when methodology and interpretation are strictly defined and the pathologists are uniquely trained. The application of validated ALK IHC assays and its comparison to ALK-FISH is highly needed in future clinical trials. This might answer the question if ALK-IHC cannot only serve as a prescreening tool, but as a stand-alone test at least in cases displaying an unequivocally staining pattern as well as an alternative predictive test in samples with reduced FISH interpretability.","author":[{"family":"M","given":"aximilian"},{"family":"W","given":"arth Arne"},{"family":"P","given":"enzel Roland"},{"family":"S","given":"chirmacher Peter"},{"family":"K","given":"err Keith M."},{"family":"E","given":"lmberger GÁππran"},{"family":"S","given":"childhaus Hans-Ulrich"},{"family":"B","given":"Áæπttner Reinhard"},{"family":"L","given":"opez-Rios Fernando"},{"family":"R","given":"eu Simone"},{"family":"K","given":"irchner Thomas"},{"family":"P","given":"auwels Patrick"},{"family":"S","given":"pecht Katja"},{"family":"D","given":"recoll Enken"},{"family":"H","given":"Áππfler Heinz"},{"family":"A","given":"ust Daniela"},{"family":"B","given":"aretton Gustavo B."},{"family":"B","given":"ubendorf Lukas"},{"family":"S","given":"tallmann Sonja"},{"family":"F","given":"isseler-Eckhoff Annette"},{"family":"S","given":"oltermann Alex"},{"family":"T","given":"ischler Verena"},{"family":"M","given":"och Holger"},{"family":"P","given":"enault-Llorca FrÁüádÁüárique"},{"family":"H","given":"ager Hendrik"},{"family":"S","given":"chÁì£per Frank"},{"family":"L","given":"enze Dido"},{"family":"H","given":"ummel Michael"},{"family":"D","given":"ietel Manfred von Laffert"}],"citation-key":"m_multicenter_2014","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

An experienced observer shadowed residents during a single day shift, captured all their activities using an iPad application, and took field notes. The activities were captured using a validated taxonomy of clinical activities, expanded to describe computer-based activities with a greater level of detail.\n        Results¬†\n        Residents spent 364.5 minutes (50.6%) of their shift time using computers, compared with 67.8 minutes (9.4%) interacting with patients. In addition, they spent 292.3 minutes (40.6%) talking with others in person, 186.0 minutes (25.8%) handling paper notes, 79.7 minutes (11.1%) in rounds, 80.0 minutes (11.1%) walking or waiting, and 54.0 minutes (7.5%) talking on the phone.

Since May 2015, 1040 of these patients with advanced cancer were referred by their oncologists for germline analysis of 76 cancer predisposition genes. Patients with clinically actionable inherited mutations whose genetic test results would not have been predicted by published decision rules were identified. Follow-up for potential clinical implications of mutation detection was through May 2017.\nEXPOSURE: Tumor and germline sequencing compared with the predicted yield of targeted germline sequencing based on clinical guidelines.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of clinically actionable germline mutations detected by universal tumor-normal sequencing that would not have been detected by guideline-directed testing.\nRESULTS: Of 1040 patients, the median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50.5-66 years), 65.3% were male, and 81.3% had stage IV disease at the time of genomic analysis, with prostate, renal, pancreatic, breast, and colon cancer as the most common diagnoses. Of the 1040 patients, 182 (17.5%; 95% CI, 15.3%-19.9%) had clinically actionable mutations conferring cancer susceptibility, including 149 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations; 101 patients tested (9.7%; 95% CI, 8.1%-11.7%) would not have had these mutations detected using clinical guidelines, including 65 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations. Frequency of inherited mutations was related to case mix, stage, and founder mutations. Germline findings led to discussion or initiation of change to targeted therapy in 38 patients tested (3.7%) and predictive testing in the families of 13 individuals (1.3%), including 6 for whom genetic evaluation would not have been initiated by guideline-based testing.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this referral population with selected advanced cancers, universal sequencing of a broad panel of cancer-related genes in paired germline and tumor DNA samples was associated with increased detection of individuals with potentially clinically significant heritable mutations over the predicted yield of targeted germline testing based on current clinical guidelines. Knowledge of these additional mutations can help guide therapeutic and preventive interventions, but whether all of these interventions would improve outcomes for patients with cancer or their family members requires further study.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01775072.","author":[{"family":"Mandelker","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liying"},{"family":"Kemel","given":"Yelena"},{"family":"Stadler","given":"Zsofia K."},{"family":"Joseph","given":"Vijai"},{"family":"Zehir","given":"Ahmet"},{"family":"Pradhan","given":"Nisha"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Li","given":"Yirong"},{"family":"Balakrishnan","given":"Anoop R."},{"family":"Syed","given":"Aijazuddin"},{"family":"Prasad","given":"Meera"},{"family":"Nafa","given":"Khedoudja"},{"family":"Carlo","given":"Maria I."},{"family":"Cadoo","given":"Karen A."},{"family":"Sheehan","given":"Meg"},{"family":"Fleischut","given":"Megan H."},{"family":"Salo-Mullen","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Trottier","given":"Magan"},{"family":"Lipkin","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Lincoln","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Semanti"},{"family":"Ravichandran","given":"Vignesh"},{"family":"Cambria","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Galle","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Abida","given":"Wassim"},{"family":"Arcila","given":"Marcia E."},{"family":"Benayed","given":"Ryma"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Ronak"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Bajorin","given":"Dean F."},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Jonathan A."},{"family":"Leach","given":"Steven D."},{"family":"Lowery","given":"Maeve A."},{"family":"Garcia-Aguilar","given":"Julio"},{"family":"Kantoff","given":"Philip W."},{"family":"Sawyers","given":"Charles L."},{"family":"Dickler","given":"Maura N."},{"family":"Saltz","given":"Leonard"},{"family":"Motzer","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"O'Reilly","given":"Eileen M."},{"family":"Scher","given":"Howard I."},{"family":"Baselga","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Klimstra","given":"David S."},{"family":"Solit","given":"David B."},{"family":"Hyman","given":"David M."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Ladanyi","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Robson","given":"Mark E."},{"family":"Offit","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"mandelker_mutation_2017","container-title":"JAMA","container-title-short":"JAMA","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2017.11137","ISSN":"1538-3598","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"825-835","PMCID":"PMC5611881","PMID":"28873162","source":"PubMed","title":"Mutation Detection in Patients With Advanced Cancer by Universal Sequencing of Cancer-Related Genes in Tumor and Normal DNA vs Guideline-Based Germline Testing","type":"article-journal","volume":"318"},

The CRC mortality rate in the US has decreased in recent decades, with a 51% drop between 1976 and 2014. This drop is attributed, in part, to the tremendous therapeutic improvements, especially after the 2000s, in addition to increased social awareness regarding risk factors and diagnostic improvement. Five-fluorouracil, irinotecan, capecitabine, and later oxaliplatin were the mainstays of mCRC treatment from the 1960s to 2002. Since then, more than a dozen drugs have been approved for the disease, betting on a new chapter in medicine, precision oncology, which uses patient and tumor characteristics to guide the therapeutic choice. Thus, this review will summarize the current literature on targeted therapies, highlighting the molecular biomarkers involved and their pathways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Manzi","given":"Joao"},{"family":"Hoff","given":"Camilla O."},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Raphaella"},{"family":"Pimentel","given":"Agustin"},{"family":"Datta","given":"Jashodeep"},{"family":"Livingstone","given":"Alan S."},{"family":"Vianna","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Abreu","given":"Phillipe"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"manzi_targeted_2023","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers15113023","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"11","page":"3023","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"5.2","title":"Targeted Therapies in Colorectal Cancer: Recent Advances in Biomarkers, Landmark Trials, and Future Perspectives","title-short":"Targeted Therapies in Colorectal Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/11/3023","volume":"15"},

The BRAFV600E mutation occurs in approximately 8‚Äì12% of patients and is characterised by an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. Here we review the current knowledge on BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC and provide a series of consensus statements on its clinical management. The treatment landscape for BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC has changed greatly due to the emergence of molecular targeted therapies (including BRAF inhibitors) and immune checkpoint inhibitors. A scientific literature search identified available data on molecular testing, treatments, and clinical monitoring of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. Consensus statements were dis¬≠ cussed and developed by a European expert panel. This manuscript provides consensus management guidance for different clinical presentations of BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC and makes recommendations regarding treatment sequencing choices. To guide appropriate clinical management and treatment decisions for mCRC patients, tumour tissue analysis for DNA mismatch repair/microsatellite status and, at a minimum, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutational status is mandatory at the time of diagnosis. Finally, we discuss the rapidly evolving treatment landscape for BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC and define priorities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that are needed to improve patient outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Martinelli","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Cervantes","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Stintzing","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Van Cutsem","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Tabernero","given":"Josep"},{"family":"Taieb","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Wasan","given":"Harpreet"},{"family":"Ciardiello","given":"Fortunato"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"martinelli_european_2023","container-title":"Cancer Treatment Reviews","container-title-short":"Cancer Treatment Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.ctrv.2023.102541","ISSN":"03057372","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"102541","source":"11.8","title":"European expert panel consensus on the clinical management of BRAF-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305737223000324","volume":"115"},

To identify, at the submicroscopic level, oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed an investigation of genomic copy number alterations using single nucleotide polymorphism array, genomic polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of candidate genes. Patients and Methods Eighty-three patients with de novo adult Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) ÔøΩ¢ñØositive ALL were enrolled onto institutional (n 17) or Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dellÔøΩÁ¶ëdulto Working Party delle Leucemia Acute (n 66) clinical trials. Treatments included tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) alone, conventional chemotherapy, or a combination of TKI and chemotherapy. Results A 7p12 deletion of IKZF1 (Ikaros) was identified in 52 (63%) of 83 patients. The pattern of deletion varied among different patients, but the two most common deletion types were loss of exons 4 to 7 in 31 (37%) of 83 patients and loss of exons 2 to 7 in 17 (20%) of 83 patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10 v 32 months, respectively; P .02). Furthermore, a significantly shorter cumulative incidence of relapse was recorded in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10.1 v 56.1 months, respectively; P .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the negative prognostic impact of IKZF1 deletion on DFS (P .04). Conclusion We conclude that IKZF1 deletions are likely to be a genomic alteration that significantly affects the prognosis of Ph-positive ALL in adults.","author":[{"family":"Martinelli","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Iacobucci","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Storlazzi","given":"Clelia Tiziana"},{"family":"Vignetti","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Paoloni","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Cilloni","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Soverini","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Vitale","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Chiaretti","given":"Sabina"},{"family":"Cimino","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Papayannidis","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Paolini","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Elia","given":"Loredana"},{"family":"Fazi","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Meloni","given":"Giovanna"},{"family":"S","given":"Amadori"},{"family":"Saglio","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Pane","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Baccarani","given":"Michele"},{"family":"FoÔøΩ","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"martinelli_ikzf1_2009","container-title":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J. clin. oncol. : off. j.

However, prognosis for old or unfit patients remains poor. In the INCB84344-201 (formerly GIMEMA LAL 1811) prospective, multicenter, phase 2 trial, we tested the efficacy and safety of ponatinib plus prednisone in newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL aged ÔøΩÔøΩ60 years, or unfit for intensive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Forty-four patients received oral ponatinib 45 mg/day for 48 weeks (core phase), with prednisone tapered to 60 mg/m2/day from days -14 to 29. Prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was administered monthly. Median age was 66.5 years (range, 26-85). The primary endpoint (complete hematologic response [CHR] at 24 weeks) was reached in 38/44 patients (86.4%); complete molecular response (CMR) was reached in 18/44 patients (40.9%) at 24 weeks. 61.4% of patients completed the core phase. As of April 24, 2020, median event-free survival was 14.31 months (95% CI 9.30, 22.31). Median overall survival and duration of CHR were not reached; median duration of CMR was 11.6 months. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were rash (36.4%), asthenia (22.7%), alanine transaminase increased (15.9%), erythema (15.9%), and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (15.9%). Cardiac and vascular TEAEs occurred in 29.5% (grade ÔøΩÔøΩ3, 18.2%) and 27.3% (grade ÔøΩÔøΩ3, 15.9%) of patients, respectively.

  {"id":"martino_retrospective_2006","abstract":"In this multicenter retrospective study, the outcomes of 836 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent transplantation with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor were analyzed according to 2 types of conditioning: reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in 215 patients, and standard myeloablative (or high-dose) conditioning (SMC) in 621 patients. In multivariate analysis, the 3-year relapse rate was significantly increased after RIC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2-2.2; P = .001), but the 3-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was decreased in the RIC group (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91; P = .015). The 3-year probabilities of progression-free and overall survivals were similar in both groups (39% after SMC vs 33% in RIC; multivariate P = .9; and 45% vs 41%, respectively; P = .8). In conclusion, the lower 3-year NRM after RIC is encouraging, since these patients were older (age > 50 years in 73% RIC vs 28% in SMC, P < .001) and had more adverse pretransplantation variables. However, based on the higher risk of relapse, patients with no contraindications for SMC should not receive RIC outside of prospective randomized trials, which are needed to establish the position of RIC-based transplantation in the treatment of patients with MDS.","author":[{"family":"Martino","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Iacobelli","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Brand","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Thekla"},{"family":"van","given":"Biezen Anja"},{"family":"Finke","given":"J√ºrgen"},{"family":"Bacigalupo","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Beelen","given":"Dietrich W."},{"family":"Reiffers","given":"J"},{"family":"Devergie","given":"Agn√®s"},{"family":"Alessandrino","given":"Emilie"},{"family":"Mufti","given":"Ghulam J."},{"family":"Barge","given":"Renee M.Y."},{"family":"Sierra","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Ruutu","given":"Tapani"},{"family":"Boogaerts","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Falda","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Jouet","given":"Jean Pierre"},{"family":"Niederwieser","given":"Dieter"},{"family":"de","given":"Witte Theo"}],"citation-key":"martino_retrospective_2006","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2005-11-4503","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"836-846","title":"Retrospective comparison of reduced-intensity conditioning and conventional high-dose conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using HLA-identical sibling donors in myelodysplastic syndromes.","type":"article-journal","volume":"108"},
  {"id":"marusyk_intratumor_2020","abstract":"Advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis have translated into knowledge-based therapies directed against specific oncogenic signaling targets. These therapies often induce dramatic responses in susceptible tumors. Unfortunately, most advanced cancers, including those with robust initial responses, eventually acquire resistance to targeted therapies and relapse. Even though immune-based therapies are more likely to achieve complete cures, acquired resistance remains an obstacle to their success as well. Acquired resistance is the direct consequence of pre-existing intratumor heterogeneity and ongoing diversification during therapy, which enables some tumor cells to survive treatment and facilitates the development of new therapy-resistant phenotypes. In this review, we discuss the sources of intratumor heterogeneity and approaches to capture and account for it during clinical decision making. Finally, we outline potential strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes by directly targeting intratumor heterogeneity.","author":[{"family":"Marusyk","given":"Andriy"},{"family":"Janiszewska","given":"Michalina"},{"family":"Polyak","given":"Kornelia"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"marusyk_intratumor_2020","container-title":"Cancer cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.ccell.2020.03.007","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"471-484","source":"50.3","title":"Intratumor Heterogeneity: The Rosetta Stone of Therapy Resistance","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"masi_continuation_2015","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The combination of bevacizumab with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is a standard first-line treatment option in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We studied the efficacy of continuing or reintroducing bevacizumab in combination with second-line chemotherapy after progression to bevacizumab-based first-line therapy.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase III study, patients with mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were randomized to receive in second-line mFOLFOX-6 or FOLFIRI (depending on first-line regimen) with or without bevacizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival. To detect a hazard ratio (HR) for progression of 0.70 with an Œ± and Œ≤ error of 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, 262 patients were required.\nRESULTS: In consideration of the results of the ML18147 trial, the study was prematurely stopped. Between April 2008 and May 2012, a total of 185 patients were randomized. Bevacizumab-free interval was longer than 3 months in 43% of patients in chemotherapy alone arm and in 50% of patients in the bevacizumab arm. At a median follow-up of 45.3 months, the median progression-free survival was 5.0 months in the chemotherapy group and 6.8 months in the bevacizumab group [adjusted HR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-0.95; stratified log-rank P = 0.010]. Subgroup analyses showed a consistent benefit in all subgroups analyzed and in particular in patients who had continued or reintroduced bevacizumab. An improved overall survival was also observed in the bevacizumab arm (adjusted HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.56-1.06; stratified log-rank P = 0.043). Responses (RECIST 1.0) were similar in the chemotherapy and bevacizumab groups (17% and 21%; P = 0.573). Toxicity profile was consistent with previously reported data.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the continuation or the reintroduction of bevacizumab with second-line chemotherapy beyond first progression improves the outcome and supports the use of this strategy in the treatment of mCRC.

When managed with multiagent chemotherapy regimens alone, patients have traditionally had an inferior outcome in terms of remission duration and overall survival when compared with patients who are Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩÂøõegative. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and dasatinib, directly inhibit the BCR-ABL kinase, offering a targeted approach as a therapeutic option. As a result of several clinical trials with adequate follow-up, imatinib combined with chemotherapy represents the current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has previously been the only modality to offer the potential for a cure, and it still should be considered for all patients deemed able to tolerate such an intervention. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib, may further improve the outcome in these patients. The role of molecular monitoring and the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors after stem cell transplantation are areas of active investigation, and the results of ongoing trials will help to clarify the optimal management of these patients.","author":[{"family":"Mathisen","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Deborah A."},{"family":"Cortes","given":"Jorge E."},{"family":"Kantarjian","given":"Hagop M."},{"family":"Ravandi","given":"Farhad"}],"citation-key":"mathisen_role_2011","container-title":"Current Hematologic Malignancy Reports","container-title-short":"Curr.

  {"id":"mato_toxicities_2018","abstract":"Clinical trials that led to ibrutinib‚Äôs approval for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed that its side effects differ from those of traditional chemotherapy. Reasons for discontinuation in clinical practice have not been adequately studied. We conducted a retrospective analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with ibrutinib either commercially or on clinical trials. We aimed to compare the type and frequency of toxicities reported in either setting, assess discontinuation rates, and evaluate outcomes. This multicenter, retrospective analysis included ibrutinib-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients at nine United States cancer centers or from the Connect¬Æ Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Registry. We examined demographics, dosing, discontinuation rates and reasons, toxicities, and outcomes. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Six hundred sixteen ibrutinib-treated patients were identified. A total of 546 (88%) patients were treated with the commercial drug. Clinical trial patients were younger (mean age 58 versus 61 years, P=0.01) and had a similar time from diagnosis to treatment with ibrutinib (mean 85 versus 87 months, P=0.8). With a median follow-up of 17 months, an estimated 41% of patients discontinued ibrutinib (median time to ibrutinib discontinuation was 7 months). Notably, ibrutinib toxicity was the most common reason for discontinuation in all settings. The median progression-free survival and overall survival for the entire cohort were 35 months and not reached (median follow-up 17 months), respectively. In the largest reported series on ibrutinib- treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we show that 41% of patients discontinued ibrutinib. Intolerance as opposed to chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression was the most common reason for discontinuation. Outcomes remain excellent and were not affected by line of therapy or whether patients were treated on clinical studies or commercially. These data strongly argue in favor of finding strategies to minimize ibrutinib intolerance so that efficacy can be further maximized. Future clinical trials should consider time-limited therapy approaches, particularly in patients achieving a complete response, in order to minimize ibrutinib exposure.","author":[{"family":"Mato","given":"Anthony R."},{"family":"Nabhan","given":"Chadhi"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Meghan C."},{"family":"Lamanna","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Brander","given":"Danielle M."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Brian T."},{"family":"Howlett","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Skarbnik","given":"Alan P"},{"family":"Cheson","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Zent","given":"Clive S."},{"family":"Pu","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Kiselev","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Goy","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Claxton","given":"David F."},{"family":"Isaac","given":"Krista"},{"family":"Kennard","given":"Kaitlin"},{"family":"Timlin","given":"Colleen"},{"family":"Landsburg","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Winter","given":"Allison M."},{"family":"Nasta","given":"Sunita D."},{"family":"Bachow","given":"Spencer Henick"},{"family":"Schuster","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Dorsey","given":"Colleen"},{"family":"Svoboda","given":"Jakub"},{"family":"Barr","given":"Paul M."},{"family":"Ujjani","given":"Chaitra S."}],"citation-key":"mato_toxicities_2018","container-title":"Haematologica","DOI":"10.3324/haematol.2017.182907","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en-US","note":"titleTranslation: ÁæéÂúã 616 ÂêçÊé•Âèó‰æùÈ≠ØÊõøÂ∞ºÊ≤ªÁôÇÁöÑÊÇ£ËÄÖÁöÑÊØíÊÄßÂíåÁµêÊûúÔºöÁúüÂØ¶‰∏ñÁïåÂàÜÊûê","page":"874-879","title":"Toxicities and outcomes of 616 ibrutinib-treated patients in the United States: a real-world analysis","type":"article-journal","volume":"103"},

  {"id":"matulonis_ovarian_2016","abstract":"Ovarian cancer is not a single disease and can be subdivided into at least five different histological subtypes that have different identifiable risk factors, cells of origin, molecular compositions, clinical features and treatments. Ovarian cancer is a global problem, is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has no effective screening strategy. Standard treatments for newly diagnosed cancer consist of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. In recurrent cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are used, and immunological therapies are currently being tested. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of ovarian cancer and at diagnosis is typically very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, in addition to the other histologies, HGSCs frequently relapse and become increasingly resistant to chemotherapy. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and finding ways to overcome them are active areas of study in ovarian cancer. Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), as well as a precursor lesion of HGSC called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies.","author":[{"family":"Matulonis","given":"Ursula A."},{"family":"Sood","given":"Anil K."},{"family":"Fallowfield","given":"Lesley"},{"family":"Howitt","given":"Brooke E."},{"family":"Sehouli","given":"Jalid"},{"family":"Karlan","given":"Beth Y."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"matulonis_ovarian_2016","container-title":"Nature Reviews.

  {"id":"maughan_addition_2011","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In the Medical Research Council (MRC) COIN trial, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted antibody cetuximab was added to standard chemotherapy in first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer with the aim of assessing effect on overall survival.\nMETHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, patients who were fit for but had not received previous chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (arm A), the same combination plus cetuximab (arm B), or intermittent chemotherapy (arm C). The choice of fluoropyrimidine therapy (capecitabine or infused fluouroracil plus leucovorin) was decided before randomisation. Randomisation was done centrally (via telephone) by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit using minimisation. Treatment allocation was not masked. The comparison of arms A and C is described in a companion paper. Here, we present the comparison of arm A and B, for which the primary outcome was overall survival in patients with KRAS wild-type tumours. Analysis was by intention to treat. Further analyses with respect to NRAS, BRAF, and EGFR status were done. The trial is registered, ISRCTN27286448.\nFINDINGS: 1630 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (815 to standard therapy and 815 to addition of cetuximab). Tumour samples from 1316 (81%) patients were used for somatic molecular analyses; 565 (43%) had KRAS mutations. In patients with KRAS wild-type tumours (arm A, n=367; arm B, n=362), overall survival did not differ between treatment groups (median survival 17¬∑9 months [IQR 10¬∑3-29¬∑2] in the control group vs 17¬∑0 months [9¬∑4-30¬∑1] in the cetuximab group; HR 1¬∑04, 95% CI 0¬∑87-1¬∑23, p=0¬∑67). Similarly, there was no effect on progression-free survival (8¬∑6 months [IQR 5¬∑0-12¬∑5] in the control group vs 8¬∑6 months [5¬∑1-13¬∑8] in the cetuximab group; HR 0¬∑96, 0¬∑82-1¬∑12, p=0¬∑60). Overall response rate increased from 57% (n=209) with chemotherapy alone to 64% (n=232) with addition of cetuximab (p=0¬∑049). Grade 3 and higher skin and gastrointestinal toxic effects were increased with cetuximab (14 vs 114 and 67 vs 97 patients in the control group vs the cetuximab group with KRAS wild-type tumours, respectively). Overall survival differs by somatic mutation status irrespective of treatment received: BRAF mutant, 8¬∑8 months (IQR 4¬∑5-27¬∑4); KRAS mutant, 14¬∑4 months (8¬∑5-24¬∑0); all wild-type, 20¬∑1 months (11¬∑5-31¬∑7).\nINTERPRETATION: This trial has not confirmed a benefit of addition of cetuximab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in first-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Cetuximab increases response rate, with no evidence of benefit in progression-free or overall survival in KRAS wild-type patients or even in patients selected by additional mutational analysis of their tumours. The use of cetuximab in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine in first-line chemotherapy in patients with widespread metastases cannot be recommended.\nFUNDING: Cancer Research UK, Cancer Research Wales, UK Medical Research Council, Merck KGgA.","author":[{"family":"Maughan","given":"Timothy S."},{"family":"Adams","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Meade","given":"Angela M."},{"family":"Seymour","given":"Matthew T."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Richard H."},{"family":"Idziaszczyk","given":"Shelley"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"David"},{"family":"Kenny","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"Kay","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Jenna K."},{"family":"Madi","given":"Ayman"},{"family":"Jasani","given":"Bharat"},{"family":"James","given":"Michelle D."},{"family":"Bridgewater","given":"John"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"M.

To assess treatment effects in the treated (full analysis set [FAS]) and enrolled (intention-to-treat [ITT]) study populations, the JULIET FAS vs the CORAL follow-up FAS and JULIET ITT vs CORAL follow-up ITT populations were separately compared. Propensity score weighting using standardized mortality ratio weight (SMRW) and fine stratification weight (FSW) was used to compare OS and ORR, adjusting for baseline confounders. The results indicated that tisagenlecleucel was associated with a lower hazard of death among the FAS (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], both FSW and SMRW, 0.44 [0.32, 0.59]) and ITT populations (FSW, 0.60 [0.44, 0.77]; SMRW, 0.57 [0.44, 0.73]; all, P < .001). Median OS was 12.48 months (JULIET) vs 4.34 to 4.40 months (CORAL) for the FAS, and 8.25 (JULIET) months vs 4.04 to 4.86 (CORAL) months for the ITT populations. Tisagenlecleucel was associated with a significantly higher ORR compared with historical treatments among the FAS (adjusted response rate difference [95% confidence interval], both FSW and SMRW, 36% [22%, 0.48%]; P < .001) and among the ITT populations after SMRW adjustment (11% [0%, 22%]; P = .043).

  {"id":"mcbane_apixaban_2017","abstract":"Summary\n            Currently, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the guideline endorsed treatment of patients with cancer associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). While apixaban is approved for the treatment of acute VTE, there are limited data supporting its use in cancer patients. The rationale and design of this investigator initiated Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, open label, superiority trial assessing the safety of apixaban versus dalteparin for cancer associated VTE is provided (ADAM-VTE; NCT02585713). The main aim of the ADAM-VTE trial is to test the hypothesis that apixaban is associated with a significantly lower rate of major bleeding compared to dalteparin in the treatment of cancer patients with acute VTE. The primary safety outcome is rate of major bleeding. Secondary efficacy objective is to assess the rates of recurrent VTE or arterial thromboembolism. Cancer patients with acute VTE (n=300) are randomized to receive apixaban (10 mg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily thereafter) or dalteparin (200 IU/Kg daily for 30 days followed by 150 IU/kg daily thereafter) for 6 months. Stratification factors used for randomization include cancer stage and cancer specific risk of venous thromboembolism using the Khorana score. Participating centers are chosen from the Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU) consortium comprised of 90 oncology practices in the United States and Canada. Based on the hypothesis to be tested, we anticipate that these trial results will provide evidence supporting apixaban as an effective treatment of cancer associated VTE at lower rates of major bleeding compared to LMWH.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"McBane","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Loprinzi","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Ashrani","given":"Aneel"},{"family":"Botero","given":"Juliana Perez"},{"family":"Leon Ferre","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Henkin","given":"Stanislav"},{"family":"Lenz","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Le-Rademacher","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Wysokinski","given":"Waldemar"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"mcbane_apixaban_2017","container-title":"Thrombosis and Haemostasis","container-title-short":"Thromb Haemost","DOI":"10.1160/TH17-03-0193","ISSN":"0340-6245, 2567-689X","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"1952-1961","source":"6.681","title":"Apixaban and dalteparin in active malignancy associated venous thromboembolism: The ADAM VTE Trial","title-short":"Apixaban and dalteparin in active malignancy associated venous thromboembolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1160/TH17-03-0193","volume":"117"},

  {"id":"mccoach_resistance_2018","abstract":"Purpose: Despite initial benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ALK (ALK+) and ROS1 (ROS1+) gene fusions ultimately progress. Here, we report on the potential resistance mechanisms in a series of patients with ALK+ and ROS1+ NSCLC progressing on different types and/or lines of ROS1/ALK-targeted therapy.Experimental Design: We used a combination of next-generation sequencing (NGS), multiplex mutation assay, direct DNA sequencing, RT-PCR, and FISH to identify fusion variants/partners and copy-number gain (CNG), kinase domain mutations (KDM), and copy-number variations (CNVs) in other cancer-related genes. We performed testing on 12 ROS1+ and 43 ALK+ patients.Results: One of 12 ROS1+ (8%) and 15 of 43 (35%) ALK + patients harbored KDM. In the ROS1+ cohort, we identified KIT and Â∏£-catenin mutations and HER2-mediated bypass signaling as non-ROS1-dominant resistance mechanisms. In the ALK+ cohort, we identified a novel NRG1 gene fusion, a RET fusion, 2 EGFR, and 3 KRAS mutations, as well as mutations in IDH1, RIT1, NOTCH, and NF1 In addition, we identified CNV in multiple proto-oncogenes genes including PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, GNAS, K/HRAS, RET, NTRK1, MAP2K1, and others.Conclusions: We identified a putative TKI resistance mechanism in six of 12 (50%) ROS1 + patients and 37 of 43 (86%) ALK+ patients. Our data suggest that a focus on KDMs will miss most resistance mechanisms; broader gene testing strategies and functional validation is warranted to devise new therapeutic strategies for drug resistance.

  {"id":"mcdaniel_nextgeneration_2015","abstract":"High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent and lethal form of ovarian cancer. HGSCs frequently arise in the distal fallopian tubes rather than the ovary, developing from small precursor lesions called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (TICs, or more specifically, STICs). While STICs have been reported to harbor TP53 mutations, detailed molecular characterizations of these lesions are lacking.We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 4 women, 2 with HGSC and 2 with uterine endometrioid carcinoma (UEC) who were diagnosed as having synchronous STICs. We detected concordant mutations in both HGSCs with synchronous STICs, including TP53 mutations as well as assumed germline BRCA1/2 alterations, confirming a clonal association between these lesions. Next-generation sequencing  confirmed the presence of a STIC clonally unrelated to 1 case of UEC, and NGS of the other tubal lesion diagnosed as a STIC unexpectedly supported the lesion as a micrometastasis from the associated UEC.We demonstrate that targeted NGS can identify genetic alterations in minute lesions, such as TICs, and confirm TP53 mutations as early driving events for HGSC. Next-generation sequencing also demonstrated unexpected associations between presumed STICs and synchronous carcinomas, providing evidence that some TICs are actually metastases rather than HGSC precursors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"McDaniel","given":"Andrew S."},{"family":"Stall","given":"Jennifer N."},{"family":"Hovelson","given":"Daniel H."},{"family":"Cani","given":"Andi K."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chia-Jen"},{"family":"Tomlins","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Cho","given":"Kathleen R."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"mcdaniel_nextgeneration_2015","container-title":"JAMA Oncology","container-title-short":"JAMA Oncology","DOI":"10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.1618","ISSN":"2374-2437","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1128-1132","PMCID":"PMC4935931","PMID":"26181193","source":"33.006","title":"Next-Generation Sequencing of Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinomas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.1618","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"mcdermott_genomic_2008","abstract":"Selective kinase inhibitors have had a substantial impact on the field of medical oncology. Whereas these agents can elicit dramatic clinical responses in some settings, their activity is generally limited to a subset of treated patients whose tumor cells harbor a specific genetic lesion. We have established an automated platform for examining the sensitivity to various molecularly targeted inhibitors across a large panel of human tumor-derived cell lines to identify additional genotype-correlated responses that may be clinically relevant. Among the inhibitors tested in a panel of 602 cell lines derived from a variety of human cancers, we found that a selective inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) potently suppressed growth of a small subset of tumor cells. This subset included lines derived from anaplastic large cell lymphomas, non-small-cell lung cancers, and neuroblastomas. ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that was first identified as part of a protein fusion derived from a chromosomal translocation detected in the majority of anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients, and has recently been implicated as an oncogene in a small fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and neuroblastomas. Significantly, sensitivity in these cell lines was well correlated with specific ALK genomic rearrangements, including chromosomal translocations and gene amplification. Moreover, in such cell lines, ALK kinase inhibition can lead to potent suppression of downstream survival signaling and an apoptotic response. These findings suggest that a subset of lung cancers, lymphomas, and neuroblastomas that harbor genomic ALK alterations may be clinically responsive to pharmacologic ALK inhibition.","author":[{"family":"McDermott","given":"Ultan"},{"family":"Iafrate","given":"A.

  {"id":"merrill_phase_2023","abstract":"Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is often used as consolidation for several subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in first remission. However, many patients relapse after ASCT and have a very poor prognosis. There are no approved treatment options for post-transplant maintenance or consolidation in PTCL. PD-1 blockade has demonstrated some efficacy for patients with PTCL. We therefore conducted a phase 2 multicenter study of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab after ASCT in patients with PTCL in first remission. Pembrolizumab was administered at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles within 21 days from post-ASCT discharge (and within 60 days of stem cell infusion). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 18 months post-ASCT. Twenty-one patients were treated on this study and (14) 67% completed 8 cycles of treatment. Among all evaluable patients, 13/21 were alive and progression-free at 18-months post-ASCT, meeting the study's primary endpoint. The estimated 18-month PFS was 83.6% (95% CI: 68 - 100), and OS 94.4% (95% CI: 84 - 100). The toxicity profile was consistent with the known toxicity profile of pembrolizumab with no grade 5 toxicities. In conclusion, PD-1 blockade after ASCT with pembrolizumab is feasible with a favorable safety profile and promising activity, supporting further confirmatory studies.

Currently available treatments have limited success, with <5% of patients undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation, a procedure that offers the only possible cure. Critical contributions of the bone marrow microenvironment to the MDS have recently been investigated. Although the better understanding of the underlying biology, particularly genetics of haematopoietic stem cells, has led to better disease and risk classification; however, the role that the bone marrow microenvironment plays in the development of MDS remains largely unclear. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in understanding the aetiology of MDS, particularly focussing on understanding how HSCs and the surrounding immune/non-immune bone marrow niche interacts together.","author":[{"family":"Mian","given":"Syed A"},{"family":"Bonnet","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"mian_nature_2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13164116","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"4116-NA","title":"Nature or Nurture?

Despite this, Tx is often started prior to, and without knowledge of, an actionable oncogenic driver (AOD), and often without subsequent switch to appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In this study we sought to assess the impact of TAT of genomic testing on Tx in patients harboring a potentially actionable EGFR mutation. Methods: By interrogating the IC curated database, we identified 2,357 newly diagnosed NSCLC 4 patients (pts) who started an initial line of therapy (LOT 1) between 1/1/2019 and 12/31/2021. Squamous carcinoma pts were excluded unless documented to be never smokers or &lt;age 40. We assessed testing across all sample types and performed the analysis on solid tumor tissue next-generation sequence (NGS) tested patients. We used an order for EGFR as a surrogate for AOD evaluation and collected date of order and reporting of EGFR test results, and date of 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> Tx start. From this, we calculated TAT and whether Tx was initiated after genomic results. In addition, we captured whether testing was in-house or by reference lab (RL). We looked at the RLs that comprise of the top 85% of NGS test sources, where the testing source was known. We removed records where test order dates and results dates were the same date, where test order dates or results dates were unknown, and where TAT &gt; 90 days. EGFR Effective Testing Rate (EETR) is defined as EGFR result prior to line 1 Tx start. Results: Median age was 70 (range 40 - 89) and 50% male. Pts with TAT of ‚â§7 days had an 82% EETR vs. Pts with TAT of &gt;29 days had a 61% EETR. Overall, RLs had a median TAT of 19 days with a 72% EETR, whereas in-house labs had a median TAT of 15 days with a EETR of 80%. Conclusions: When providers and patients can obtain test results within 21 days of test order there is a higher likelihood of waiting for the test result to start Tx. Many community oncology practices are contemplating implementing in-house testing solutions to improve rates of testing and turnaround time of testing. This may prove to be an effective strategy given the better TAT for in-house testing. When there is faster TAT, patients and providers wait to start initial Tx.

F1CDx utilizes next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) technology to examine 324 cancer genes in solid tumors. F1CDx reports known and likely pathogenic short variants (SVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), and select rearrangements, as well as complex biomarkers including tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), in addition to genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) in ovarian cancer. CGP services can reduce the complexity of biomarker testing, enabling precision medicine to improve treatment decision-making and outcomes for cancer patients, but only if test results are reliable, accurate, and validated clinically and analytically to the highest standard available. The analyses presented herein demonstrate the extensive analytical and clinical validation supporting the F1CDx initial and subsequent FDA approvals to ensure high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the data reported. The analytical validation included several in-depth evaluations of F1CDx assay performance including limit of detection (LoD), limit of blank (LoB), precision, and orthogonal concordance for SVs (including base substitutions [SUBs] and insertions/deletions [INDELs]), CNAs (including amplifications and homozygous deletions), genomic rearrangements, and select complex biomarkers. The assay validation of >30,000 test results comprises a considerable and increasing body of evidence that supports the clinical utility of F1CDx to match patients with solid tumors to targeted therapies or immunotherapies based on their tumor‚Äôs genomic alterations and biomarkers.

The purpose of this study was to determine if MTB-directed therapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) over immediately prior therapy in patients with advanced cancer.\nMethods\nThis single-arm, prospective phase II clinical trial enrolled patients with advanced cancer with an actionable mutation who received MTB-recommended targeted therapy between January 1, 2017, and October 31, 2020. MTB-recommended both on-label (level 1 evidence) and off-label (evidence levels 2 and 3) therapies. Of the 93 enrolled patients, 43 were treated frontline and 50 received second-line or greater-line therapy. The primary outcome was the probability of patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy who achieved a PFS ratio ‚â• 1.3 (PFS on MTB-directed therapy divided by PFS on the patient's immediately prior therapy). Secondary outcomes included PFS for patients treated frontline and overall survival and adverse effects for the entire study population.\nResults\nThe most common disease sites were lung (35 of 93, 38%), gynecologic (17 of 93, 18%), GI (16 of 93, 17%), and head and neck (7 of 93, 8%). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of PFS ratio ‚â• 1.3 was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.75) for patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy. The median PFS was 449 (range 42-1,125) days for patients treated frontline. The median overall survival was 768 (range 22-1,240) days. There were four nontreatment-related deaths.\nConclusion\nWhen treated with MTB-directed therapy, most patients experienced improved PFS compared with immediately prior treatment. MTB-directed targeted therapy may be a strategy to improve outcomes for patients with advanced cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Rachel W."},{"family":"Hutchcraft","given":"Megan L."},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Heidi L."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jianrong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jinpeng"},{"family":"Jayswal","given":"Rani"},{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Mikayla"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Abigail"},{"family":"Allison","given":"Derek B."},{"family":"El Khouli","given":"Riham H."},{"family":"Patel","given":"Reema A."},{"family":"Villano","given":"John L."},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Susanne M."},{"family":"Kolesar","given":"Jill M."}],"citation-key":"miller_molecular_2022","container-title":"JCO Precision Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO Precis.

  {"id":"min_computational_2013","abstract":"Copy number variation (CNV) is a prevalent form of critical genetic variation that leads to an abnormal number of copies of large genomic regions in a cell. Microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (arrayCGH) or genotyping arrays have been standard technologies to detect large regions subject to copy number changes in genomes until most recently high-resolution sequence data can be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). During the last several years, NGS-based analysis has been widely applied to identify CNVs in both healthy and diseased individuals. Correspondingly, the strong demand for NGS-based CNV analyses has fuelled development of numerous computational methods and tools for CNV detection. In this article, we review the recent advances in computational methods pertaining to CNV detection using whole genome and whole exome sequencing data. Additionally, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses and suggest directions for future development.","author":[{"family":"Min","given":""},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qingguo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Quan"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Peilin"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zhongming Zhao"}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"min_computational_2013","container-title":"BMC bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2105-14-s11-s1","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"1-16","source":"3","title":"Computational tools for copy number variation (CNV) detection using next-generation sequencing data: features and perspectives","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"minari_emergence_2020","abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) are the standard treatment for advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allowing survivals up to 5 years. However, duration of responses is limited by the almost certain occurrence of drug resistance. Here, we report a case of a never smoker, 59-year-old female with metastatic ALK-positive adenocarcinoma, solid and signet ring patterns, who developed resistance to alectinib, a second-generation ALK-TKI, mediated by HER2 gene amplification. The patient received 22 months of crizotinib as first-line and subsequently 1-year of alectinib therapy. A study of resistance mechanism was performed with next generation sequencing (NGS) on tissue re-biopsy. A HER2-amplified emerging clone was identified by NGS in a liver metastasis and confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The resistant clone was detectable 2 months before disease progression in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) copy number variation (CNV) assay and it was retrospectively traced in rare cells of the lung primary by FISH. To our best knowledge, this is first evidence of HER2 gene amplification as a resistance mechanism to ALK-TKI in a NSCLC. Future strategies against oncogene-addicted NSCLC might benefit of combined drug treatments, such as ALK and HER2 inhibition.","author":[{"family":"Minari","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Gnetti","given":"Letizia"},{"family":"Lagrasta","given":"Costanza"},{"family":"Squadrilli","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Bordi","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Azzoni","given":"Cinzia"},{"family":"Bottarelli","given":"Lorena"},{"family":"Cosenza","given":"Agnese"},{"family":"Ferri","given":"Leonarda"},{"family":"Caruso","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Silini","given":"Enrico Maria"},{"family":"Tiseo","given":"Marcello"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"minari_emergence_2020","container-title":"Translational lung cancer research","container-title-short":"Transl.

  {"id":"mirza_forefront_2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In recurrent ovarian cancer, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibiting agents have transformed the treatment of platinum-sensitive disease. New data support use of PARP inhibitors earlier in the treatment algorithm.\nDESIGN: We review results from recent phase III trials evaluating PARP inhibitors as treatment and/or maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. We discuss the efficacy and safety of these agents in the all-comer and biomarker-selected populations studied in clinical trials, and compare the strengths and limitations of the various trial designs. We also consider priorities for future research, with a particular focus on patient selection and future regimens for populations with high unmet need.\nRESULTS: Four phase III trials (SOLO-1, PAOLA-1/ENGOT-OV25, PRIMA/ENGOT-OV26 and VELIA/GOG-3005) demonstrated remarkable improvements in progression-free survival with PARP inhibitor therapy (olaparib, niraparib or veliparib) for newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. Differences in trial design (treatment and/or maintenance setting; single agent or combination; bevacizumab or no bevacizumab), patient selection (surgical outcome, biomarker eligibility, prognosis) and primary analysis population (intention-to-treat, BRCA mutated or homologous recombination deficiency positive) affect the conclusions that can be drawn from these trials. Overall survival data are pending and there is limited experience regarding long-term safety.\nCONCLUSIONS: PARP inhibitors play a pivotal role in the management of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, which will affect subsequent treatment choices. Refinement of testing for patient selection and identification of regimens to treat populations that appear to benefit less from PARP inhibitors are a priority.","author":[{"family":"Mirza","given":"M.

The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here. Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (ÔøΩÔøΩ 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225). Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type. The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7%) were observed. Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4%) and 117 (52.0%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively. The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044). The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib. The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2% and 46.3% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively. Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis. Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI. Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.","author":[{"family":"Mok","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiangdong"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Ki Hyeong"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Kazuhiko"},{"family":"Niho","given":"Seiji"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Min"},{"family":"Linke","given":"R."},{"family":"Rosell","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Corral","given":"Jesus"},{"family":"Migliorino","given":"Maria Rita"},{"family":"Pluzanski","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Sbar","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"White","given":"Jane Liang"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yi-Long"}],"citation-key":"mok_improvement_2018","container-title":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J.

The efficacy of osimertinib as compared with platinum-based therapy plus pemetrexed in such patients is unknown.\nMETHODS In this randomized, international, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned 419 patients with T790M-positive advanced non‚Äìsmall-cell lung cancer, who had disease progression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy, in a 2:1 ratio to receive either oral osimertinib (at a dose of 80 mg once daily) or intravenous pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter of body-surface area) plus either carboplatin (target area under the curve, 5 [AUC5]) or cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles; maintenance pemetrexed was allowed. In all the patients, disease had progressed during receipt of first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.

DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1612674 Copyright ¬© 2016 Massachusetts Medical Society.\nRESULTS The median duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer with osimertinib than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months; hazard ratio; 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.41; P<0.001). The objective response rate was significantly better with osimertinib (71%; 95% CI, 65 to 76) than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (31%; 95% CI, 24 to 40) (odds ratio for objective response, 5.39; 95% CI, 3.47 to 8.48; P<0.001). Among 144 patients with metastases to the central nervous system (CNS), the median duration of progression-free survival was longer among patients receiving osimertinib than among those receiving platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (8.5 months vs. 4.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.49). The proportion of patients with adverse events of grade 3 or higher was lower with osimertinib (23%) than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (47%).\nCONCLUSIONS Osimertinib had significantly greater efficacy than platinum therapy plus pemetrexed in patients with T790M-positive advanced non‚Äìsmall-cell lung cancer (including those with CNS metastases) in whom disease had progressed during first-line EGFR-TKI therapy.

  {"id":"mooressheri_novel_2016","abstract":"Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations become resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), often through second-site mutations in EGFR (T790M) and/or activation of the cMet pathway. We engineered a bispecific EGFR-cMet antibody (JNJ-61186372) with multiple mechanisms of action to inhibit primary/secondary EGFR mutations and the cMet pathway. JNJ-61186372 blocked ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and cMet and inhibited phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT more potently than the combination of single receptor-binding antibodies. In NSCLC tumor models driven by EGFR and/or cMet, JNJ-61186372 treatment resulted in tumor regression through inhibition of signaling/receptor downmodulation and Fc-driven effector interactions. Complete and durable regression of human lung xenograft tumors was observed with the combination of JNJ-61186372 and a third-generation EGFR TKI. Interestingly, treatment of cynomolgus monkeys with JNJ-61186372 resulted in no major toxicities, including absence of skin rash observed with other EGFR-directed agents. These results highlight the differentiated potential of JNJ-61186372 to inhibit the spectrum of mutations driving EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC.

  {"id":"moreno_standard_2020","abstract":"Despite the effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), in most cases the clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by consecutive episodes of disease progression and need for therapy. Treatment possibilities for patients with CLL in whom CIT fails whose disease progresses after initial CIT include pathway inhibitors (PIs) and, for selected patients, cellular therapy (ie, allogeneic stem cell transplant, chimeric antigen receptor T cells). PIs (ie, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, and BCL2 inhibitors) are revolutionizing the treatment of CLL. PIs have proved to be more effective than CIT, both as upfront therapy and for relapsed/refractory disease, largely because they may overcome the negative impact of adverse biomarkers (eg, TP53 aberrations, unmutated IGHV) on outcomes and because of their acceptable toxicity.

  {"id":"morris_treatment_2022","abstract":"PURPOSE To develop recommendations for treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of relevant studies and develop recommendations for clinical practice. RESULTS Five systematic reviews and 10 randomized controlled trials met the systematic review inclusion criteria. RECOMMENDATIONS Doublet chemotherapy should be offered, or triplet therapy may be offered to patients with previously untreated, initially unresectable mCRC, on the basis of included studies of chemotherapy in combination with anti‚Äìvascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. In the first-line setting, pembrolizumab is recommended for patients with mCRC and microsatellite instability-high or deficient mismatch repair tumors; chemotherapy and anti‚Äìepidermal growth factor receptor therapy is recommended for microsatellite stable or proficient mismatch repair left-sided treatment-naive RAS wild-type mCRC; chemotherapy and anti‚Äìvascular endothelial growth factor therapy is recommended for microsatellite stable or proficient mismatch repair RAS wild-type right-sided mCRC. Encorafenib plus cetuximab is recommended for patients with previously treated BRAF V600E‚Äìmutant mCRC that has progressed after at least one previous line of therapy. Cytoreductive surgery plus systemic chemotherapy may be recommended for selected patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases; however, the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not recommended. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be recommended following systemic therapy for patients with oligometastases of the liver who are not considered candidates for resection. Selective internal radiation therapy is not routinely recommended for patients with unilobar or bilobar metastases of the liver. Perioperative chemotherapy or surgery alone should be offered to patients with mCRC who are candidates for potentially curative resection of liver metastases.

  {"id":"mrimi_emodepside_2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Current treatments for soil-transmitted helminth infections in humans have low efficacy against Trichuris trichiura. Emodepside - a drug in veterinary use and under development for the treatment of onchocerciasis in humans - is a leading therapeutic candidate for soil-transmitted helminth infection.\nMETHODS: We conducted two phase 2a, dose-ranging, randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of emodepside against T. trichiura and hookworm infections. We randomly assigned, in equal numbers, adults 18 to 45 years of age in whom T. trichiura or hookworm eggs had been detected in stool samples to receive emodepside, at a single oral dose of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 mg; albendazole, at a single oral dose of 400 mg; or placebo. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants who were cured of T. trichiura or hookworm infection (the cure rate) with emodepside 14 to 21 days after treatment, determined with the use of the Kato-Katz thick-smear technique. Safety was assessed 3, 24, and 48 hours after the receipt of treatment or placebo.\nRESULTS: A total of 266 persons were enrolled in the T. trichiura trial and 176 in the hookworm trial. The predicted cure rate against T. trichiura in the 5-mg emodepside group (85% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 69 to 93]; 25 of 30 participants) was higher than the predicted cure rate in the placebo group (10% [95% CI, 3 to 26]; 3 of 31 participants) and the observed cure rate in the albendazole group (17% [95% CI, 6 to 35]; 5 of 30 participants). A dose-dependent relationship was shown in participants with hookworm: the observed cure rate was 32% (95% CI, 13 to 57; 6 of 19 participants) in the 5-mg emodepside group and 95% (95% CI, 74 to 99.9; 18 of 19 participants) in the 30-mg emodepside group; the observed cure rates were 14% (95% CI, 3 to 36; 3 of 21 participants) in the placebo group and 70% (95% CI, 46 to 88; 14 of 20 participants) in the albendazole group. In the emodepside groups, headache, blurred vision, and dizziness were the most commonly reported adverse events 3 and 24 hours after treatment; the incidence of events generally increased in a dose-dependent fashion. Most adverse events were mild in severity and were self-limited; there were few moderate and no serious adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Emodepside showed activity against T. trichiura and hookworm infections.

The aim of our study was to identify the mechanisms underlying resistance to osimertinib and to correlate them with clinical outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced NSCLC who received osimertinib for T790M-mutated acquired resistance to prior EGFR-TKIs between March 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Patients with paired molecular data of pre-osimertinib and after resistance development, which were not confirmed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation, were included in the molecular analysis set. Of 49 patients evaluated in the molecular analysis set, 24 patients maintained T790M mutation, while 25 patients exhibited T790M-loss. Molecular modifications were identified in 27 of 49 patients including EGFR acquired mutations (C797S, C796S, G796S, V802I, V834L, E758D and G724S), non-EGFR-dependent mutations (PIK3CA, ALK, BRAF, KRAS and TP53), EGFR amplification and MET amplification. At data cutoff, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.3 months in the T790M-retain group compared with 7.8 months in T790M-loss patients (P = 0.053). Median PFS was significantly longer in patients with EGFR-dependent resistance mechanism (13.5 months) than in those with alternative pathway activation (8.2 months; P = 0.012). The study revealed heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib in advanced NSCLC patients and their association with clinical outcomes. Patients who maintained T790M mutation or with EGFR-dependent resistance mechanism had longer clinical outcome benefits.","author":[{"family":"Mu","given":"Yuxin"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Xuezhi"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Puyuan"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Xingsheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Teng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jinyao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Ziyi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Junling"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"mu_acquired_2020","container-title":"Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology","container-title-short":"J.

The phase 3 RESONATE study showed improved efficacy of single-agent ibrutinib over ofatumumab in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL, including those with high-risk features. Here we report the final analysis from RESONATE with median follow-up on study of 65.3‚Äâmonths (range, 0.3-71.6) in the ibrutinib arm. Median progression-free survival (PFS) remained significantly longer for patients randomized to ibrutinib vs ofatumumab (44.1 vs 8.1‚Äâmonths; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.148; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.113-0.196; PÀÇ.001). The PFS benefit with ibrutinib vs ofatumumab was preserved in the genomic high-risk population with del(17p), TP53 mutation, del(11q), and/or unmutated IGHV status (median PFS 44.1 vs 8.0‚Äâmonths; HR: 0.110; 95% CI: 0.080-0.152), which represented 82% of patients.

Overall survival, censored for crossover, was better with ibrutinib than ofatumumab (HR: 0.639; 95% CI: 0.418-0.975). With up to 71‚Äâmonths (median 41‚Äâmonths) of ibrutinib therapy, the safety profile remained consistent with prior reports; cumulatively, all-grade (grade‚Äâ‚â•3) hypertension and atrial fibrillation occurred in 21% (9%) and 12% (6%) of patients, respectively. Only 16% discontinued ibrutinib because of adverse events (AEs). These long-term results confirm the robust efficacy of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL irrespective of high-risk clinical or genomic features, with no unexpected AEs.

  {"id":"murray_tpx0131_2021","abstract":"Since 2011, with the approval of crizotinib and subsequent approval of four additional targeted therapies, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors have become important treatments for a subset of patients with lung cancer. Each generation of ALK inhibitor showed improvements in terms of central nervous system (CNS) penetration and potency against wild-type (WT) ALK, yet a key continued limitation is their susceptibility to resistance from ALK active-site mutations. The solvent front mutation (G1202R) and gatekeeper mutation (L1196M) are major resistance mechanisms to the first two generations of inhibitors while patients treated with the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib often experience progressive disease with multiple mutations on the same allele (mutations in cis, compound mutations). TPX-0131 is a compact macrocyclic molecule designed to fit within the ATP-binding boundary to inhibit ALK fusion proteins. In cellular assays, TPX-0131 was more potent than all five approved ALK inhibitors against WT ALK and many types of ALK resistance mutations, e.g., G1202R, L1196M, and compound mutations. In biochemical assays, TPX-0131 potently inhibited (IC50 <10 nmol/L) WT ALK and 26 ALK mutants (single and compound mutations). TPX-0131, but not lorlatinib, caused complete tumor regression in ALK (G1202R) and ALK compound mutation-dependent xenograft models. Following repeat oral administration of TPX-0131 to rats, brain levels of TPX-0131 were approximately 66% of those observed in plasma. Taken together, preclinical studies show that TPX-0131 is a CNS-penetrant, next-generation ALK inhibitor that has potency against WT ALK and a spectrum of acquired resistance mutations, especially the G1202R solvent front mutation and compound mutations, for which there are currently no effective therapies.","author":[{"family":"Murray","given":"Brion W."},{"family":"Zhai","given":"Dayong"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Jane","given":"Ung"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Vivian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Han"},{"family":"Barrera","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Parra","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Cowell","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Dong J."},{"family":"Aloysius","given":"Herve"},{"family":"Rogers","given":"Evan"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"murray_tpx0131_2021","container-title":"Molecular cancer therapeutics","container-title-short":"Mol.

Results from the IMpower150 trial led to the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the ABCP (atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel) regimen in 2018 as a treatment option for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC in the metastatic setting.3Socinski M.A. Jotte R.M.

In a separate analysis in 2019, the authors concluded that overall survival (OS) was also improved in the EGFR mutation-positive (EGFR mutation+) group with the ABCP regimen.5Reck M. Mok T.S.K.

The disappearance of a statistically significant OS benefit in these updated results should be a warning light for practitioners who have adopted routine use of ABCP in this patient population. CPIs have become a routine part of the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC, but the use of CPIs in EGFR mutation+ patients has been much less fruitful. Early studies evaluating CPIs in the second-line setting versus docetaxel revealed improvement in OS with the use of IO in the overall population, but this benefit did not translate to the subgroup of patients with EGFR mutations.9Rittmeyer A.

The positive OS results from the initial EGFR subgroup analysis in the IMpower150 study were therefore an exciting outcome that many were ready to implement into clinical practice. The main objective of the IMpower 150 trial was to evaluate whether the combination of ABCP could improve survival outcomes in metastatic, nonsquamous NSCLC. Patients were randomized to either treatment with ABCP, ACP (atezolizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel), or BCP. ABCP and ACP were each separately compared with BCP. The primary analysis population was patients with a wild-type genotype (excluded patients with EGFR or ALK genomic alterations). ABCP improved both OS and PFS in the wild-type and the ITT population indicating the combination could be used in advanced nonsquamous disease. The ACP regimen did not reveal statistically significant benefits.3Socinski M.A. Jotte R.M.

The three other subgroups evaluated were patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations, before EGFR TKI use, and baseline liver metastases. Results revealed an improvement in OS with ABCP in the EGFR-sensitizing mutation and liver metastases subgroups (HR = 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11ÔøΩÔøΩ0.83 and HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.33ÔøΩÔøΩ0.82). PFS was also statistically improved in both of these subgroups and in patients previously on a TKI. These results marked the first time that a survival benefit was found with CPI use in EGFR positive (EGFR+) patients, and the authors rightfully called for further evaluation of this regimen in EGFR mutation+ disease.5Reck M. Mok T.S.K. Nishio M. et al.Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (IMpower150): key subgroup analyses of patients with EGFR mutations or baseline liver metastases in a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial.Lancet Respir Med. 2019; 7: 387-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar The final analysis of the subgroups included approximately 20 additional months of data collection. At that point, all the previously positive findings had lost statistical significance. In the EGFR-sensitizing mutation subgroup, the median OS for ABCP was 29.4 months compared with 18.1 months with BCP, but the CI now crossed one (95% CI: 0.31ÔøΩÔøΩ1.14). The liver metastases subgroup encountered the same issue on final analysis (95% CI: 0.45ÔøΩÔøΩ1.02). The ABCP arms for the two other subgroups (all EGFR mutations and previous TKI use) continued to reveal a statistically insignificant trend toward improved survival, and the ACP arms for all four subgroups continued to have similar survival results as the counterpart BCP arms.8Nogami N, Barlesi F, Socinski MA, et al. IMpower150 final exploratory analyses for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and chemotherapy in key NSCLC patient subgroups with EGFR mutations or metastases in the liver or brain. J Thorac Oncol. 2022;17:309-323.Google Scholar Does this mean that ABCP should not be used routinely for patients with advanced EGFR mutation+ disease? On the basis of the updated results, there would seem to be no compelling evidence that the ABCP combination should be a preferred regimen for EGFR mutation+ patients outside of a clinical trial. One could even argue that treating EGFR+ patients with ABCP on the basis of the initial analysis may have been premature given that this subgroup was small and was removed from the ITT analysis, and thus not included in the Food and Drug Administration label. Only 123 of 1202 patients in the study had an EGFR mutation, and even fewer patients had a sensitizing mutation (91) or were previously treated with a TKI (78). In addition, even though these were prespecified subgroups, the authors acknowledged that the results are exploratory and are not appropriately powered for formal statistical testing. This lack of power is why the IMpower150 subgroup data by itself should not be used to change clinical practice, although it is certainly compelling enough that the positive trends should still pique interest. The difference between the median OS of the ABCP and BCP arms in both of these subgroups is sizable and clinically significant (11 mo and 9 mo, respectively). The ACP arms, in contrast, had a similar OS compared with BCP. The difference between the ABCP and ACP results suggests that the addition of bevacizumab is potentially making difference. The investigators had hypothesized that bevacizumab would make the tumor environment more susceptible to IO. The major takeaway from the updated results is that we need larger studies evaluating the efficacy of programmed death-ligand 1 with chemotherapy (and possibly antiangiogenics) in EGFR mutation+ patients. The wait may not be too much longer as two trials focusing on patients with EGFR mutation+ nonsquamous NSCLC after progression on a TKI should have results presented soon. The global ORIENT-31 study is evaluating the quadruple regimen of sintilimab plus bevacizumab and platinum chemotherapy, with an estimated accrual of approximately 600 patients divided between three arms. Interestingly, patients will only have stage IIIB or IIIC disease that is not amenable resection or chemoradiation. It has already been announced in a news release that the study met its first primary end point of improved PFS at a first interim analysis.14Shibata T. Uryu S. Kokubu A. et al.Genetic classification of lung adenocarcinoma based on array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis: its association with clinicopathologic features.Clin Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 6177-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar A second trial looking at this question is the ongoing KEYNOTE-789 study of platinum and pemetrexed with or without pembrolizumab in previously TKI-treated advanced EGFR mutation+ patients.15Riely G. Hui R. Carbone D. et al.P1.01-81 phase 3 study of pemetrexed-platinum with or without pembrolizumab for TKI-resistant/EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC: KEYNOTE-789.J Thorac Oncol. 2018; 13: S494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar The IMpower150 trial is a good example of the importance of subgroup analyses in formulating testable hypotheses, but also in the importance of evaluating final data before making formal practice changes on the basis of these subgroups. It has also highlighted that we still do not have a clear role yet for CPIs in the treatment of EGFR+ disease. At the same time, it did provide a possible strategy out of this dilemma, and the upcoming phase 3 trials likely will put this issue to rest soon. Although the IMpower150 results did not have the same impact as initially thought, it still played an important part in investigating the chemotherapy and CPI combinations in patients with EGFR mutations.

In everyday clinical practice, haematologists involved in CAR T cell treatment of patients with R/R DLBCL have to deal with diagnostically complex cases and difficult therapeutic choices. The availability of novel immunotherapeutic agents for R/R DLBCL and recent advances in understanding CAR T-cell failure mechanisms demand a rational approach to identify the best choice for bridging therapy and managing post-CAR T-cell therapy relapses. Moreover, positron emission tomography/computerised tomography may result in false-positive interpretation, highlighting the importance of post-treatment biopsy. In this review, we discuss all above issues, presenting four instructive cases, with the aim to provide criteria and new perspectives for CAR T-cell treatment of DLBCL.","author":[{"family":"Nagler","given":"Arnon"},{"family":"Perriello","given":"Vincenzo Maria"},{"family":"Falini","given":"Lorenza"},{"family":"Falini","given":"Brunangelo"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"nagler_how_2023","container-title":"British Journal of Haematology","container-title-short":"Br J Haematol","DOI":"10.1111/bjh.18724","ISSN":"1365-2141","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"396-410","PMID":"36916189","source":"8.615","title":"How I treat refractory/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cells","type":"article-journal","volume":"201"},
  {"id":"nagpal_development_2019","abstract":"For prostate cancer patients, the Gleason score is one of the most important prognostic factors, potentially determining treatment independent of the stage. However, Gleason scoring is based on subjective microscopic examination of tumor morphology and suffers from poor reproducibility. Here we present a deep learning system (DLS) for Gleason scoring whole-slide images of prostatectomies. Our system was developed using 112 million pathologist-annotated image patches from 1226 slides, and evaluated on an independent validation dataset of 331 slides. Compared to a reference standard provided by genitourinary pathology experts, the mean accuracy among 29 general pathologists was 0.61 on the validation set. The DLS achieved a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy of 0.70 (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002) and trended towards better patient risk stratification in correlations to clinical follow-up data. Our approach could improve the accuracy of Gleason scoring and subsequent therapy decisions, particularly where specialist expertise is unavailable. The DLS also goes beyond the current Gleason system to more finely characterize and quantitate tumor morphology, providing opportunities for refinement of the Gleason system itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Nagpal","given":"Kunal"},{"family":"Foote","given":"Davis"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Po-Hsuan Cameron"},{"family":"Wulczyn","given":"Ellery"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Fraser"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Jenny L."},{"family":"Mohtashamian","given":"Arash"},{"family":"Wren","given":"James H."},{"family":"Corrado","given":"Greg S."},{"family":"MacDonald","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Lily H."},{"family":"Amin","given":"Mahul B."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Sangoi","given":"Ankur R."},{"family":"Mermel","given":"Craig H."},{"family":"Hipp","given":"Jason D."},{"family":"Stumpe","given":"Martin C."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"nagpal_development_2019","container-title":"npj Digital Medicine","container-title-short":"npj Digit.

We investigated if EGFR-activating mutation subtypes impact treatment outcomes in the phase III RELAY study. Associations between EGFR mutation type and preexisting co-occurring and treatment-emergent genetic alterations were also explored. Materials and Methods: Patients with metastatic NSCLC, an EGFR ex19del or ex21L858R mutation, and no central nervous system metastases were randomized (1:1) to erlotinib (150 mg/day) with either ramucirumab (10 mg/kg; RAM+ERL) or placebo (PBO+ERL), every 2 weeks, until RECIST v1.1ÔøΩ°û´efined progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), PFS2, time-to-chemotherapy (TTCT), safety, and next-generation sequencing analyses. Results: Patients with ex19del and ex21L858R mutations had similar clinical characteristics and comutational profiles. One-year PFS rates for ex19del patients were 74% for RAM+ERL versus 54% for PBO+ERL; for ex21L858R rates were 70% (RAM+ERL) versus 47% (PBO+ERL). Similar treatment benefits (ORR, DOR, PFS2, and TTCT) were observed in RAM+ERLÔøΩÊáÄreated patients with ex19del and ex21L858R. Baseline TP53 comutation was associated with superior outcomes for RAM+ERL in both ex19del and ex21L858R subgroups. EGFR T790M mutation rate at progression was similar between treatment arms and by mutation type. Conclusions: RAM+ERL provided significant clinical benefit for both EGFR ex19del and ex21L858R NSCLC, supporting this regimen as suitable for patients with either of these EGFR mutation types.","author":[{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Kazuhiko"},{"family":"Nadal","given":"Ernest"},{"family":"Garon","given":"Edward B."},{"family":"Nishio","given":"Makoto"},{"family":"Seto","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Nobuyuki"},{"family":"Park","given":"Keunchil"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Jin-Yuan"},{"family":"Paz-Ares","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Frimodt-Moller","given":"Bente"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Annamaria"},{"family":"Wijayawardana","given":"Sameera R."},{"family":"Visseren-Grul","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Reck","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"nakagawa_relay_2021","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

However, acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs remains an inevitable problem. In this study, we aimed to discover novel therapeutic targets to conquer ALK-positive lung cancer. We established three types of ALK-TKI (crizotinib, alectinib and ceritinib)-resistant H2228 NSCLC cell lines by high exposure and stepwise methods. We found these cells showed a loss of ALK signaling, overexpressed AXL with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and had cancer stem cell-like (CSC) properties, suggesting drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations. Similarly, we demonstrated that TGF-Â∏£1 treated H2228 cells also showed AXL overexpression with EMT features and ALK-TKI resistance. The AXL inhibitor, R428, or HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib, were effective in reversing ALK-TKI resistance and EMT changes in both ALK-TKI-resistant and TGF-Â∏£1-exposed H2228 cells. Tumor volumes of xenograft mice implanted with established H2228-ceritinib-resistant (H2228-CER) cells were significantly reduced after treatment with ganetespib, or ganetespib in combination with ceritinib. Some ALK-positive NSCLC patients with AXL overexpression showed a poorer response to crizotinib therapy than patients with a low expression of AXL. ALK signaling-independent AXL overexpressed in drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations with EMT and CSC features may be commonly involved commonly involved in intrinsic and acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. This suggests AXL and HSP90 inhibitors may be promising therapeutic drugs to overcome drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations in ALK-positive NSCLC patients for the reason that ALK-positive NSCLC cells do not live through ALK-TKI therapy.","author":[{"family":"Nakamichi","given":"Shinji"},{"family":"Seike","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Miyanaga","given":"Akihiko"},{"family":"Chiba","given":"Mika"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Fenfei"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Akiko"},{"family":"Ishikawa","given":"Arimi"},{"family":"Kunugi","given":"Shinobu"},{"family":"Noro","given":"Rintaro"},{"family":"Kubota","given":"Kaoru"},{"family":"Gemma","given":"Akihiko"}],"citation-key":"nakamichi_overcoming_2018","container-title":"Oncotarget","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.25531","issue":"43","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"27242-27255","title":"Overcoming drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations showing AXL activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition is critical in conquering ALK-positive lung cancer.","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"nakamura_multicenter_2020","abstract":"Background: Recent advances in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have improved patient survival and quality of life (QOL), while reducing transfusion burden. However, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), widely used in younger MDS patients, remains the only curative therapy for MDS. While transplantation outcomes among selected older patients with MDS are similar to younger patients with MDS, early transplantation for older patients is infrequently offered since the relative benefits of HCT over non-HCT therapy in have not been well defined in this patient group. We conducted a multi-center, biologic assignment trial in older individuals with high risk MDS to define the benefit of HCT over non-HCT therapy.Methods: The study was a multicenter, biologic assignment trial in subjects aged 50-75 with higher risk de novo MDS (IPSS Intermediate-2 (Int-2) or High) who were candidates for reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT, comparing outcomes of those with a suitable 8/8 HLA-matched donor to those without a donor. The trial was conducted by the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN 1102, NCT02016781). Eligible subjects were enrolled prior to a formal donor search, and before or after MDS treatment was initiated. Biological assignment to the Donor or No Donor arm was based on high-resolution HLA typing of eligible family members and a search of the unrelated donor registries. Subjects were initially assigned to the No Donor arm and re-assigned to the Donor arm when a suitable donor was identified. Subjects who died or whose 90-day donor search ended without identifying a suitable donor remained in the No Donor arm. Subjects in the Donor arm were expected to undergo RIC HCT within 6 months of enrollment. Subjects underwent RIC HCT or non-HCT therapy according to institutional standards. The primary analysis compared three-year overall survival (OS) between arms using adjusted survival estimates to account for the potential bias resulting from biological assignment. The sample size was selected to provide at least 80% power to detect a difference of 15% in 3-year OS. Between January 2014 and November 2018, 384 subjects (Donor n=260, No Donor n=124) were enrolled at 34 centers. The study arms were well balanced for age, gender, KPS, IPSS risk, MDS disease duration and responsiveness to hypomethylating therapy (Table). The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 34.2 months (range: 2.3-38 months) in the Donor arm and 26.9 months (range: 2.4-37.2 months) in the No Donor arm.Results: In an intent-to-treat analysis, adjusted OS at 3 years from study enrollment in the Donor arm was 47.9% (95% CI: 41.3%-54.1%) compared with 26.6% (95% CI: 18.4%-35.6%) in the No Donor arm (p=0.0001, absolute difference 21.3%, 95% CI: 10.2%-31.8%)(Figure). A sensitivity analysis excluding subjects assigned to the No Donor arm who died or withdrew prior to the end of the 90-day search window showed no effect on outcome (Adjusted OS: 48.0% vs. 28.1%, p=0.0004). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 3 years was greater in the Donor arm (35.8%, 95% CI: 29.8%-41.8%) compared with the No Donor arm (20.6%, 95% CI: 13.3%-29.1%, p=0.003), with no changes in the sensitivity analysis. An OS and LFS benefit was seen across all subgroups tested (Figure).There were no clinically significant differences in QOL between Donor and No Donor arms as measured by the FACT-G, the MOS-SF36 Physical and Mental Component Scores and the EQ-5D utility score at all time points.The overall non-compliance rate for the trial was 26.3%. Reasons for non-compliance included the use of myeloablative conditioning or failure to proceed to RIC transplant in the Donor arm, and the use of alternative donors in the No Donor arm. In an as-treated analysis, comparison of the HCT and No HCT arms demonstrated a significant advantage in 3-year OS (47.4% vs. 16.0%, p&lt;0.0001) and LFS (39.3% vs. 10.9%, p&lt;0.0001) for subjects who underwent HCT.Conclusions: We observed a significant OS advantage in older patients with Int-2 and High IPSS risk de novo MDS who are RIC HCT candidates and have an HLA-matched donor, when compared with those without a donor. The benefit of having a matched donor was seen across subgroups, including those who were of Medicare age (&gt;65) and below. HCT should be offered to all individuals between the ages of 50-75 with Int-2 and High IPSS risk MDS in whom a suitable donor can be identified.TableNakamura:Magenta Therapeutics: Other: Advisory board meeting; Kyowa-Kirin: Other: Support on a meeting presentation; Alexion: Other: Support on a meeting presentation; Merck: Other: advisory board meeting; NapaJen Pharma: Consultancy; Kadmon Corporation: Other: Advisory board meeting; Celgene: Other: Support on seminar; Viracor: Consultancy.

The purpose of our study is to elucidate the effect of gene mutations on hematological response and overall survival (OS), particularly focusing on their posttreatment clone size. We enrolled a total of 449 patients with MDS or related myeloid neoplasms. They were analyzed for gene mutations in pretreatment (n¬†= 449) and posttreatment (n¬†= 289) bone marrow samples using targeted-capture sequencing to assess the impact of gene mutations and their posttreatment clone size on treatment outcomes. In Cox proportional hazard modeling, multihit TP53 mutation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-2.91; P¬†< .001), EZH2 mutation (HR, 1.71; 95%¬†CI, 1.14-2.54; P¬†= .009), and DDX41 mutation (HR, 0.33; 95%¬†CI, 0.17-0.62; P¬†< .001), together with age, high-risk karyotypes, low platelets, and high blast counts, independently predicted OS. Posttreatment clone size accounting for all drivers significantly correlated with International Working Group (IWG) response (P¬†< .001, using trend test), except for that of DDX41-mutated clones, which did not predict IWG response. Combined, IWG response and posttreatment clone size further improved the prediction of the original model and even that of a recently proposed molecular prediction model, the molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M; c-index, 0.653 vs 0.688; P¬†< .001, using likelihood ratio test).

  {"id":"negrin_maintenance_1996","abstract":"Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have refractory cytopenias leading to transfusion requirements and infectious complications. In vitro marrow culture data have indicated that granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) synergizes with erythropoietin (EPO) for the production of erythroid precursors. In an effort to treat the anemia and neutropenia in this disorder, MDS patients were treated with a combination of recombinant human EPO and recombinant human G-CSF. Fifty-five patients were enrolled in the study of which 53 (96%) had a neutrophil response. Forty-four patients were evaluable for an erythroid response of which 21 (48%) responded. An erythroid response was significantly more likely in those patients with relatively low serum EPO levels, higher absolute basal reticulocyte counts and normal cytogenetics at study entry. Seventeen (81%) of the patients who responded to combined G-CSF plus EPO therapy continued to respond during an 8-week maintenance phase. G-CSF was then discontinued and all patients' neutrophil responses were diminished, whereas 8 continued to have an erythroid response to EPO alone. In 7 of the remaining 9 patients, resumption of G-CSF was required for recurrent erythroid responses. The median duration of erythroid responses to these cytokines was 11 months, with 6 patients having relatively prolonged and durable responses for 15 to 36 months. Our results also indicate that approximately one half of responding patients require both G-CSF and EPO to maintain an effective erythroid response, suggesting that synergy between G-CSF and EPO exists in vivo for the production of red blood cells in MDS.","author":[{"family":"Negrin","given":"Robert S."},{"family":"Stein","given":"Richard S."},{"family":"Doherty","given":"Kathleen"},{"family":"Cornwell","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Vardiman","given":"James W."},{"family":"Krantz","given":"Sanford B."},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Peter L."}],"citation-key":"negrin_maintenance_1996","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.v87.10.4076.bloodjournal87104076","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"page":"4076-4081","title":"Maintenance treatment of the anemia of myelodysplastic syndromes with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin: evidence for in vivo synergy.","type":"article-journal","volume":"87"},

The objective of this study is to identify prognostic factors and the best options for management of metastatic malignant phyllode tumors (MMPTs).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentric retrospective study, including cases of MMPT from 10 sarcoma centers, was conducted. The primary end-point was overall survival (OS), and the secondary end-point was the clinical benefit of chemotherapy (CBCT) rate.\nRESULTS: 51 MMPT patients were included. Median time from diagnosis to metastatic recurrence was 13¬†months. Management of MMPT consisted in surgery of the metastatic disease for 16 patients (31.3%), radiation therapy of the metastatic disease for 15 patients (31.9%), and chemotherapy for 37 patients (72.5%). Median follow-up was 62.1¬†months [95% confidence interval (CI) 31-80¬†months]. Median OS was 11.5¬†months (95% CI 7.5-18.7¬†months). On multivariate analysis, two or more metastatic sites [hazard ratio (HR) 2.81, 95% CI 1.27-6.19; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01] and surgery of metastasis (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.78; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01) were independently associated with OS. The CBCT rate was 31.4% and 16.7% for the first and second lines. Polychemotherapy was not superior to single-agent therapy. Alkylating-agent-based chemotherapy, possibly associated with anthracyclines, was associated with a better CBCT rate than anthracyclines alone (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.049).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study emphasize the impact of the number of metastatic sites on survival of MMPT patients and the leading role of metastasis surgery in MMPT management. If systemic therapy is used, it should include alkylating agents, which are associated with a better clinical benefit.","author":[{"family":"Neron","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Sajous","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Thezenas","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Piperno-Neumann","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Reyal","given":"Fabien"},{"family":"La√©","given":"Marick"},{"family":"Chakiba","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Penel","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Ryckewaert","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Honor√©","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Bertucci","given":"Fran√ßois"},{"family":"Monneur","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Salas","given":"S√©bastien"},{"family":"Duffaud","given":"Florence"},{"family":"Saada-Bouzid","given":"Esma"},{"family":"Isambert","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Brahmi","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Ray-Coquard","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Blay","given":"Jean-Yves"},{"family":"Firmin","given":"Nelly"},{"family":"French Sarcoma Group (GSF-GETO)","given":""}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"neron_impact_2020","container-title":"Annals of Surgical Oncology","container-title-short":"Ann Surg Oncol","DOI":"10.1245/s10434-019-08097-x","ISSN":"1534-4681","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5]]},"language":"en","page":"1693-1699","PMID":"31773519","source":"4.339","title":"Impact of Metastasis Surgery and Alkylating-Agent-Based Chemotherapy on Outcomes of Metastatic Malignant Phyllodes Tumors: A Multicenter Retrospective Study","title-short":"Impact of Metastasis Surgery and Alkylating-Agent-Based Chemotherapy on Outcomes of Metastatic Malignant Phyllodes Tumors","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"nicolini_trial_2023","abstract":"Introduction: The prevention ofdisease transformation which typically occurs during the first years of treatment, is one of the critical goals of the treatment of CP-CML with TKI. In addition, treatment free remission (TFR) represents now another major challenge. In vitro data show that ponatinib is one of the most powerful inhibitors of wild-type as well as mutated BCR::ABL1 TK and this has been translated in heavily pre-treated CML patients (pts) intolerant or resistant to other compounds. In this trial we assessed the safety and efficacy of a 6-months debulking strategy using ponatinib as front-line therapy in newly diagnosed CP-CML, followed by a maintenance with imatinib, in order to bring a high proportion of pts in TFR.Methods: This open-label phase II national academic trial (Clinical Trial: NCT04070443) enrolled newly diagnosed adult CP-CML pts ‚â§65 years, with a major BCR::ABL1 transcript and no significant underlying cardio-vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes with target organ damage, QTc prolongation and with adequate organ functions. They were stratified according to the ELTS score. The primary endpoint is the impact of ponatinib induction on the rate of pts reaching TFR criteria as defined by our group (Rea et al. Cancer, 2018) at M36. Secondary endpoints were the safety and clinical activity of this strategy, ponatinib pharmacokinetics (PK), QoL under both inhibitors and compliance. Pts were treated with ponatinib 30 mg QD for 6-months, followed by imatinib 400 mg QD until TFR criteria (i. e. MR4.5 ‚â•2 years) would been reached before M60. All molecular assessments were centralised and BCR::ABL1 transcripts were expressed in % on the international scale (IS). This analysis relies on the intention-to-treat principle.Results: One hundred and seventy-eight pts were screened, 170 enrolled and 169 treated between November 2019 and October 2022. Median age was 48 (18-65) years, 113 pts were males (67%). One pt had a cryptic Ph, and 15 (9%) pts harboured additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACA). Eighty-four (51.5%) pts had b2a2 and 99 (61%) b3a2 transcripts knowing that they could harbour both. ELTS were low for 67 (40%) pts, intermediate for 73 (44%) and high for 27 (16%). For 2 patients it could not be calculated (1 splenectomy, 1 no spleen assessment). European Society of Cardiology (ESC) score was &lt;2% in 158/167 (93%) evaluable pts, 3-9% in 8 (5%) pts and &gt;10% in 1 (2%) pt. One hundred and one (60%) pts never smoked, 46 (27%) were past smokers. The median follow-up at database lock was 18 (3-33) months. Only induction data are presented here. The median number of days on ponatinib is 172 (1-193) and the median dose of ponatinib delivered is 30 (16.5-32) mg daily. Overall, 135 grade 3-5 AEs occurred after a median of 51 (0-186) days: 123 (91%) grade 3, 11 (8%) grade 4 and 1 fatal AE; 49 (36%) were hematologic, and 86 (64%) non-hematologic, and 109 (81%) were considered as related to study treatment. Seven pts (5%) discontinued permanently ponatinib, and 56 (41.5%) received the full planned dose. Six (4.5%) Grade 3-5 cardiac events (1 fatal cardiac arrest) and 17 (12.5%) vascular events (15 newly hypertensive pts, 1 pulmonary embolism? 1 carotid stenosis) occurred. Their cumulative incidence is shown in Figure 1A. Digestive &amp; clinical hepato-biliary events occurred in 10 (7.5%), infections in 7 (5%), lipase elevation in 15 (11%) and liver enzymes elevation in 20 (15%) pts. Eye, skin and neurologic events occurred in less than 2% of pts. Regarding efficacy, 147 evaluable pts/158 (93%) were in CHR at M1, 115 in CCyR (70.5%) at M3 and 158/163 (97%) in EMR. The median halving time (calculated with ABL1 as a reference gene) was 13.5 (11.5-17.5) days. The cumulative incidence of molecular response is shown in Figure 1B. Fourty-seven pts over 157 assessable (30%) were in deep molecular response at M6. One (0.6%) pt transformed into myeloid blast crisis, alive in CR before transplant. PK data and their relationship with safety and efficacy will be presented. Univariate analysis identified the halving time as the only factor impacting on MR4.5 at M6.Conclusions: Ponatinib displays high anti-leukemic activity as front-line therapy in selected newly diagnosed CP-CML pts with high early molecular response rates with non-negligible severe -in particular cardio-vascular- toxicity at 30 mg QD. Whether or not this will be translated into substantial TFR rates will be determined at later time points.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nicolini","given":"Franck E."},{"family":"Charbonnier","given":"Aude"},{"family":"Escoffre-Barbe","given":"Martine"},{"family":"Jourdan","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Roth-Guepin","given":"Gabrielle"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Marc G."},{"family":"Am√©","given":"Shanti"},{"family":"Simonet","given":"Marion"},{"family":"Johnson-Ansah","given":"Hyacinthe A."},{"family":"Dubruille","given":"Viviane"},{"family":"Charbonnier","given":"Amandine"},{"family":"Rousselot","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Orvain","given":"Corentin"},{"family":"Joly","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Ianotto","given":"Jean-Christophe"},{"family":"Cayssials","given":"Emilie"},{"family":"Meunier","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Parry","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Coiteux","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Legros","given":"Laurence"},{"family":"Zerazhi","given":"Hacene"},{"family":"Etienne","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Quittet","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Legrand","given":"Ollivier"},{"family":"Penot","given":"Amelie"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Lydia"},{"family":"Fouillet","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Morisset","given":"St√©phane"},{"family":"Tigaud","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Mayet","given":"Romaine"},{"family":"Garin","given":"Gwena√´lle"},{"family":"Guitton","given":"J√©r√¥me"},{"family":"Dulucq","given":"St√©phanie"},{"family":"Huguet","given":"Fran√ßoise"}],"citation-key":"nicolini_trial_2023","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-181571","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"Supplement 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"language":"en-US","note":"abstractTranslation: Á∞°‰ªãÔºöÈ†êÈò≤ÈÄöÂ∏∏ÁôºÁîüÂú®Ê≤ªÁôÇÊúÄÂàùÂπæÂπ¥ÁöÑÁñæÁóÖËΩâÂåñÊòØ TKI Ê≤ªÁôÇ CP-CML ÁöÑÈóúÈçµÁõÆÊ®ô‰πã‰∏Ä„ÄÇÊ≠§Â§ñÔºåÁÑ°Ê≤ªÁôÇÁ∑©Ëß£ÔºàTFRÔºâÁèæÂú®ÊòØÂè¶‰∏ÄÂÄãÈáçÂ§ßÊåëÊà∞„ÄÇÈ´îÂ§ñÊï∏ÊìöÈ°ØÁ§∫Ôºåponatinib ÊòØÈáéÁîüÂûãÂíåÁ™ÅËÆäÂûãBCR::ABL1 TK ÊúÄÂº∑Â§ßÁöÑÊäëÂà∂Âäë‰πã‰∏ÄÔºåÈÄôÂ∑≤Âú®Á∂ìÈÅéÂ§ßÈáèÊ≤ªÁôÇÁöÑ„ÄÅÂ∞çÂÖ∂‰ªñÂåñÂêàÁâ©‰∏çËÄêÂèóÊàñÊäóËó•ÊÄßÁöÑCML ÊÇ£ËÄÖ(pts) ‰∏≠ÂæóÂà∞È´îÁèæ„ÄÇÂú®ÈÄôÈ†ÖË©¶È©ó‰∏≠ÔºåÊàëÂÄëË©ï‰º∞‰∫ÜÁÇ∫Êúü6 ÂÄãÊúàÁöÑÊ∏õÁò§Á≠ñÁï•ÁöÑÂÆâÂÖ®ÊÄßÂíåÊúâÊïàÊÄßÔºåË©≤Á≠ñÁï•‰ΩøÁî®ÊôÆÁ¥çÊõøÂ∞º‰ΩúÁÇ∫Êñ∞Ë®∫Êñ∑CP-CML ÁöÑ‰∏ÄÁ∑öÊ≤ªÁôÇÔºåÈö®Âæå‰ΩøÁî®‰ºäÈ¶¨ÊõøÂ∞ºÁ∂≠ÊåÅÊ≤ªÁôÇÔºå‰ª•ÊèêÈ´òTFR ÁöÑÊÇ£ËÄÖÊØî‰æã„ÄÇÁöÑÈ´òË°ÄÂ£ìÊàñÁ≥ñÂ∞øÁóÖÁöÑÊñ∞Ë®∫Êñ∑Êàê‰∫∫CP-CML ÊÇ£ËÄÖ„ÄÇ‰ªñÂÄëÊ†πÊìö ELTS ÂàÜÊï∏ÈÄ≤Ë°åÂàÜÂ±§„ÄÇ‰∏ªË¶ÅÁµÇÈªûÊòØ ponatinib Ë™òÂ∞éÂ∞çÈÅîÂà∞ÊàëÂÄëÂ∞èÁµÑ (Rea et al.

  {"id":"niederst_allelic_2015","abstract":"Purpose A secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, is the most common resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutant adenocarcinomas that have progressed on erlotinib. Third-generation EGFR inhibitors capable of inhibiting mutant EGFR with T790M produce responses in nearly two thirds of patients. However, acquired resistance mechanisms in patients treated with these drugs are yet to be described. Experimental design To study acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors, T790M-positive cells derived from an erlotinib-resistant cancer were made resistant to a third-generation TKI and then characterized using cell and molecular analyses. Results Cells resistant to a third-generation TKI acquired an additional EGFR mutation, C797S, which prevented suppression of EGFR. Our results demonstrate that the allelic context in which C797S was acquired may predict responsiveness to alternative treatments. If the C797S and T790M mutations are in trans, cells will be resistant to third-generation EGFR TKIs, but will be sensitive to a combination of first- and third-generation TKIs. If the mutations are in cis, no EGFR TKIs alone or in combination can suppress activity. If C797S develops in cells wild-type for T790 (when third-generation TKIs are administered in the first-line setting), the cells are resistant to third-generation TKIs, but retain sensitivity to first-generation TKIs. Conclusions Mutation of C797S in EGFR is a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to third-generation TKIs. The context in which the C797S develops with respect to the other EGFR alleles affects the efficacy of subsequent treatments.","author":[{"family":"Niederst","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Hu","given":"Haichuan"},{"family":"Mulvey","given":"Hillary E."},{"family":"Lockerman","given":"Elizabeth L."},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Angel R."},{"family":"Piotrowska","given":"Zofia"},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Engelman","given":"Jeffrey A."}],"citation-key":"niederst_allelic_2015","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

  {"id":"niederst_rb_2015","abstract":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective treatments for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, relapse typically occurs after an average of 1 year of continuous treatment. A fundamental histological transformation from NSCLC to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is observed in a subset of the resistant cancers, but the molecular changes associated with this transformation remain unknown. Analysis of tumour samples and cell lines derived from resistant EGFR mutant patients revealed that Retinoblastoma (RB) is lost in 100% of these SCLC transformed cases, but rarely in those that remain NSCLC. Further, increased neuroendocrine marker and decreased EGFR expression as well as greater sensitivity to BCL2 family inhibition are observed in resistant SCLC transformed cancers compared with resistant NSCLCs. Together, these findings suggest that this subset of resistant cancers ultimately adopt many of the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of classical SCLC.","author":[{"family":"Niederst","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Poirier","given":"John T."},{"family":"Mermel","given":"Craig H."},{"family":"Lockerman","given":"Elizabeth L."},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Angel R."},{"family":"Katayama","given":"Ryohei"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Carlotta"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Kenneth N."},{"family":"Moran","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Howe","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Fulton","given":"Linnea"},{"family":"Mulvey","given":"Hillary E."},{"family":"Bernardo","given":"Lindsay A."},{"family":"Mohamoud","given":"Farhiya"},{"family":"Miyoshi","given":"Norikatsu"},{"family":"VanderLaan","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."},{"family":"Borger","given":"Darrell R."},{"family":"Ramaswamy","given":"Sridhar"},{"family":"Shioda","given":"Toshi"},{"family":"Iafrate","given":"Anthony J."},{"family":"Getz","given":"Gad"},{"family":"Rudin","given":"Charles M."},{"family":"Mino-Kenudson","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Engelman","given":"Jeffrey A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"niederst_rb_2015","container-title":"Nature communications","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"ninomiya_met_2018","abstract":"As a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), osimeritnib is the standard treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring the EGFR T790M mutation; however, acquired resistance inevitably develops. Therefore, a next-generation treatment strategy is warranted in the osimertinib era. We investigated the mechanism of resistance to a novel EGFR-TKI, naquotinib, with the goal of developing a novel treatment strategy. We established multiple naquotinib-resistant cell lines or osimertinib-resistant cells, two of which were derived from EGFR-TKI-naive cells; the others were derived from gefitinib- or afatinib-resistant cells harboring EGFR T790M. We comprehensively analyzed the RNA kinome sequence, but no universal gene alterations were detected in naquotinib-resistant cells. Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) amplification was detected in naquotinib-resistant cells derived from gefitinib-resistant cells. The combination therapy of MEK inhibitors and naquotinib exhibited a highly beneficial effect in resistant cells with NRAS amplification, but the combination of MEK inhibitors and osimertinib had limited effects on naquotinib-resistant cells. Moreover, the combination of MEK inhibitors and naquotinib inhibited the growth of osimertinib-resistant cells, while the combination of MEK inhibitors and osimertinib had little effect on osimertinib-resistant cells. Clinical assessment of this novel combination (MEK inhibitors and naquotinib) is worth considering in osimertinib-resistant lung tumors.","author":[{"family":"Ninomiya","given":"Kiichiro"},{"family":"Ohashi","given":"Kadoaki"},{"family":"Makimoto","given":"Go"},{"family":"Tomida","given":"Shuta"},{"family":"Higo","given":"Hisao"},{"family":"Kayatani","given":"Hiroe"},{"family":"Ninomiya","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Kubo","given":"Toshio"},{"family":"Ichihara","given":"Eiki"},{"family":"Hotta","given":"Katsuyuki"},{"family":"Tabata","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Maeda","given":"Yoshinobu"},{"family":"Kiura","given":"Katsuyuki"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"ninomiya_met_2018","container-title":"Scientific reports","container-title-short":"Sci.

  {"id":"nogami_impower150_2021","abstract":"Abstract Introduction Final overall survival (OS) analyses are presented for EGFR mutations and liver or brain metastases subgroups in the phase III IMpower150 study (NCT02366143) evaluating atezolizumab+bevacizumab+carboplatin/paclitaxel (ABCP) or atezolizumab+carboplatin/paclitaxel (ACP) vs bevacizumab+carboplatin/paclitaxel (BCP). Methods Overall, 1202 patients (intention-to-treat [ITT] population) with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer were randomized to ABCP, ACP or BCP. Patients with treated, stable brain metastases were permitted. OS was assessed in EGFR mutations and baseline liver metastases subgroups; rate and time to development (TTD) of new brain metastases was assessed in ITT patients. Results At data cutoff (September 13, 2019; median follow-up, 39.3 months), OS improvements were sustained with ABCP versus BCP in sensitizing EGFR mutations (all: hazard ratio [HR] 0.60; 95% CI: 0.31ÔøΩÔøΩ1.14; prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]: HR 0.74; 95% CI: 0.38ÔøΩÔøΩ1.46) and baseline liver metastases (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.45ÔøΩÔøΩ1.02) subgroups. ACP did not show survival benefit versus BCP in sensitizing EGFR mutations (all: HR 1.0; 95% CI: 0.57ÔøΩÔøΩ1.74; prior TKI: HR 1.22; 95% CI: 0.68ÔøΩÔøΩ2.22) or liver metastases (HR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.68ÔøΩÔøΩ1.51) subgroups. Overall, 100 patients (8.3%) developed new brain metastases. While not formally evaluated, an improvement toward delayed TTD was seen with ABCP vs BCP (HR, 0.68; 95% CI: 0.39ÔøΩÔøΩ1.19). Conclusions This final exploratory analysis showed OS benefits for ABCP versus BCP in patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations, including those with prior TKI failures, and with liver metastases, although these results should be interpreted with caution.

Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive alectinib 600‚Äâmg twice daily or chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500‚Äâmg/m2 or docetaxel 75‚Äâmg/m2, both every 3‚Äâweeks) until disease progression, death, or withdrawal. Primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS).\nRESULTS: Altogether, 107 patients were randomized (alectinib, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ72; chemotherapy, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ35) in 13 countries across Europe and Asia. Median investigator-assessed PFS was 9.6‚Äâmonths [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.9-12.2] with alectinib and 1.4‚Äâmonths (95% CI: 1.3-1.6) with chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.15 (95% CI: 0.08-0.29); P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001].

  {"id":"nowakowski_robust_2021","abstract":"PURPOSE: Patients with the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) historically showed inferior survival with standard rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Phase II studies demonstrated that adding the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide to R-CHOP improved outcomes in ABC-type DLBCL. The goal of the global, phase III ROBUST study was to compare lenalidomide plus R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) with placebo/R-CHOP in previously untreated, ABC-type DLBCL.\nMETHODS: Histology and cell-of-origin type were prospectively analyzed by central pathology prior to random assignment and study treatment. Patients with ABC-DLBCL received lenalidomide oral 15 mg/d, days 1-14/21 plus standard R-CHOP21 versus placebo/R-CHOP21 for six cycles. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) per independent central radiology review.\nRESULTS: A total of 570 patients with ABC-DLBCL (n = 285 per arm) were stratified by International Prognostic Index score, age, and bulky disease, and randomly assigned to R2-CHOP or placebo/R-CHOP. Baseline demographics were similar between arms. Most patients completed six cycles of treatment: 74% R2-CHOP and 84% placebo/R-CHOP. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events for R2-CHOP versus placebo/R-CHOP were neutropenia (60% v 48%), anemia (22% v 14%), thrombocytopenia (17% v 11%), and leukopenia (14% v 15%). The primary end point of PFS was not met, with a hazard ratio of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.14) and P = .29; median PFS has not been reached for either arm. PFS trends favoring R2-CHOP over placebo/R-CHOP were seen in patients with higher-risk disease.\nCONCLUSION: ROBUST is the first DLBCL phase III study to integrate biomarker-driven identification of eligible ABC patients. Although the ROBUST trial did not meet the primary end point of PFS in all patients, the safety profile of R2-CHOP was consistent with individual treatments with no new safety signals.","author":[{"family":"Nowakowski","given":"Grzegorz S."},{"family":"Chiappella","given":"Annalisa"},{"family":"Gascoyne","given":"Randy D."},{"family":"Scott","given":"David W."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qingyuan"},{"family":"Jurczak","given":"Wojciech"},{"family":"√ñzcan","given":"Muhit"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Xiaonan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Belada","given":"David"},{"family":"Bergua","given":"Juan Miguel"},{"family":"Piazza","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"M√≥cikova","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Molinari","given":"Anna Lia"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Dok Hyun"},{"family":"Cavallo","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Tani","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Kazuhito"},{"family":"Izutsu","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Czuczman","given":"Myron"},{"family":"Hersey","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Kilcoyne","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Jacqueline"},{"family":"Hudak","given":"Krista"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jingshan"},{"family":"Wade","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Witzig","given":"Thomas E."},{"family":"Vitolo","given":"Umberto"}],"citation-key":"nowakowski_robust_2021","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.20.01366","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"1317-1328","PMCID":"PMC8078325","PMID":"33621109","source":"PubMed","title":"ROBUST: A Phase III Study of Lenalidomide Plus R-CHOP Versus Placebo Plus R-CHOP in Previously Untreated Patients With ABC-Type Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","title-short":"ROBUST","type":"article-journal","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"oconnell_accelerating_2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: As genome sequencing becomes better integrated into scientific research, government policy, and personalized medicine, the primary challenge for researchers is shifting from generating raw data to analyzing these vast datasets. Although much work has been done to reduce compute times using various configurations of traditional CPU computing infrastructures, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) offer opportunities to accelerate genomic workflows by orders of magnitude. Here we benchmark one GPU-accelerated software suite called NVIDIA Parabricks on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and an NVIDIA DGX cluster. We benchmarked six variant calling pipelines, including two germline callers (HaplotypeCaller and DeepVariant) and four somatic callers (Mutect2, Muse, LoFreq, SomaticSniper).\nRESULTS: We achieved up to 65‚Äâ√ó‚Äâacceleration with germline variant callers, bringing HaplotypeCaller runtimes down from 36¬†h to 33¬†min on AWS, 35¬†min on GCP, and 24¬†min on the NVIDIA DGX. Somatic callers exhibited more variation between the number of GPUs and computing platforms. On cloud platforms, GPU-accelerated germline callers resulted in cost savings compared with CPU runs, whereas some somatic callers were more expensive than CPU runs because their GPU acceleration was not sufficient to overcome the increased GPU cost.\nCONCLUSIONS: Germline variant callers scaled well with the number of GPUs across platforms, whereas somatic variant callers exhibited more variation in the number of GPUs with the fastest runtimes, suggesting that, at least with the version of Parabricks used here, these workflows are less GPU optimized and require benchmarking on the platform of choice before being deployed at production scales. Our study demonstrates that GPUs can be used to greatly accelerate genomic workflows, thus bringing closer to grasp urgent societal advances in the areas of biosurveillance and personalized medicine.","author":[{"family":"O'Connell","given":"Kyle A."},{"family":"Yosufzai","given":"Zelaikha B."},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Ross A."},{"family":"Lobb","given":"Collin J."},{"family":"Engelken","given":"Haley T."},{"family":"Gorrell","given":"Laura M."},{"family":"Carlson","given":"Thad B."},{"family":"Catana","given":"Josh J."},{"family":"Mikdadi","given":"Dina"},{"family":"Bonazzi","given":"Vivien R."},{"family":"Klenk","given":"Juergen A."}],"citation-key":"oconnell_accelerating_2023","container-title":"BMC Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"BMC Bioinf.","DOI":"10.1186/s12859-023-05292-2","ISSN":"1471-2105","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,31]]},"language":"en","page":"221","PMCID":"PMC10230726","PMID":"37259021","source":"PubMed","title":"Accelerating genomic workflows using NVIDIA parabricks","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"okada_prediction_2019","abstract":"Abstract Background Alectinib has shown a greater efficacy to ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancers in first-line setting; however, most patients relapse due to acquired resistance, such as secondary mutations in ALK including I1171N and G1202R. Although ceritinib or lorlatinib was shown to be effective to these resistant mutants, further resistance often emerges due to ALK-compound mutations in relapse patients following the use of ceritinib or lorlatinib. However, the drug for overcoming resistance has not been established yet. Methods We established lorlatinib-resistant cells harboring ALK-I1171N or -G1202R compound mutations by performing ENU mutagenesis screening or using an in vivo mouse model. We performed drug screening to overcome the lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutations. To evaluate these resistances in silico, we developed a modified computational molecular dynamic simulation (MP-CAFEE). Findings We identified 14 lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutants, including several mutants that were recently discovered in lorlatinib-resistant patients. Some of these compound mutants were found to be sensitive to early generation ALK-TKIs and several BCR-ABL inhibitors. Using our original computational simulation, we succeeded in demonstrating a clear linear correlation between binding free energy and in vitro experimental IC50 value of several ALK-TKIs to single- or compound-mutated EML4-ALK expressing Ba/F3 cells and in recapitulating the tendency of the binding affinity reduction by double mutations found in this study. Computational simulation revealed that ALK-L1256F single mutant conferred resistance to lorlatinib but increased the sensitivity to alectinib. Interpretation We discovered lorlatinib-resistant multiple ALK-compound mutations and an L1256F single mutation as well as the potential therapeutic strategies for these ALK mutations. Our original computational simulation to calculate the binding affinity may be applicable for predicting resistant mutations and for overcoming drug resistance in silico.

This dataset included a complete comprehensive QMPSF comparison of four genes (60 exons) on which we obtained 100% sensitivity and specificity. From WES data, we first compared 137 samples with aCGH and filtered comparable events (exonic CNVs encompassing enough aCGH probes) and obtained an 87.25% sensitivity. The overall PPV was 86.4% following the targeted confirmation of candidate CNVs from 1056 additional WES. In addition, our CANOES-centered workflow on WES data allowed the detection of CNVs with a resolution of single exons, allowing the detection of CNVs that were missed by aCGH. Overall, switching to an NGS-only approach should be cost-effective as it allows a reduction in overall costs together with likely stable diagnostic yields.

  {"id":"oluwatobiodetola_relapsed_2023","abstract":"There have been significant advances in the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) over the past two decades. However, the intention of treatment remains control of the disease and delay of progression rather than a cure which remains largely elusive. Considering that CLL is mostly seen in older patients, there are multiple factors that play a role in the selection of CLL beyond the frontline treatment. Here, we review the concept of relapsed CLL, factors that predispose to relapse, and therapeutic options available to this patient population. We also review investigational therapies and provide a framework for selection of therapies in this setting.Targeted therapies with continuous BTK inhibitors (BTKi) or fixed duration venetoclax plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy have established superiority over chemoimmunotherapy in relapsed CLL and have become the preferred standard of care treatment. The second-generation more selective BTK inhibitors (acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib) have shown improved safety profile compared to ibrutinib. However, resistance to the covalent BTK inhibitors may emerge and is commonly associated with mutations in BTK or other downstream enzymes. The novel non-covalent BTK inhibitors such as pirtobrutinib (Loxo-305) and nemtabrutinib (ARQ 531) are showing promising activities for relapsed CLL refractory to prior covalent BTKi. Other novel therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy have also shown significant activities for relapsed and refractory CLL. Measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment has a growing importance in venetoclax-based limited-duration therapy and there is mounting evidence that MRD negativity improves outcomes. However, it remains to be seen if this will become an established clinically significant endpoint. Further, the optimal sequence of various treatment options remains to be determined. Patients with relapsed CLL now have more options for the treatment of the disease. The choice of therapy is best individualized especially in the absence of direct comparisons of targeted therapies, and the coming years will bring more data on the best sequence of use of the therapeutic agents.","author":[{"literal":"Oluwatobi Odetola"},{"literal":"Shuo Ma"}],"citation-key":"oluwatobiodetola_relapsed_2023","container-title":"Current hematologic malignancy reports","container-title-short":"Curr.

  {"id":"onida_impact_2014","abstract":"Acquired chromosomal abnormalities are important prognostic factors in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated with supportive care and with disease-modifying therapeutic interventions, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To assess the prognostic impact of cytogenetic characteristics after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation accurately, we investigated a homogeneous group of 523 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes who have received stem cells from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings. Overall survival at five years from transplantation in good, intermediate, and poor cytogenetic risk groups according to the International Prognostic Scoring System was 48%, 45% and 30%, respectively (P<0.01). Both the disease status (complete remission vs. not in complete remission) and the morphological classification at transplant in the untreated patients were significantly associated with probability of overall survival and relapse-free survival (P<0.01). The cytogenetic risk groups have no prognostic impact in untreated patients with refractory anemia ¬± ringed sideroblasts (P=0.90). However, combining the good and intermediate cytogenetic risk groups and comparing them to the poor-risk group showed within the other three disease-status-at-transplant groups a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95%CI: 1.41-2.45). In conclusion, this study shows that, in a large series of patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes, poor-risk cytogenetics as defined by the standard International Prognostic Scoring System is associated with a relatively poor survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings except in patients who are transplanted in refractory anemia/refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts stage before progression to higher myelodysplastic syndrome stages.","author":[{"family":"Onida","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Brand","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"van","given":"Biezen Anja"},{"family":"Schaap","given":"Michel"},{"family":"von","given":"dem Borne Peter A."},{"family":"Maertens","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Beelen","given":"Dietrich W."},{"family":"Carreras","given":"Enric"},{"family":"Alessandrino","given":"Emilio Paolo"},{"family":"Volin","given":"Liisa"},{"family":"Kuball","given":"J√ºrgen"},{"family":"Figuera","given":"A"},{"family":"Sierra","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Finke","given":"J√ºrgen"},{"family":"Kr√∂ger","given":"Nicolaus"},{"family":"de","given":"Witte Theo"}],"citation-key":"onida_impact_2014","container-title":"Haematologica","DOI":"10.3324/haematol.2014.106880","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1582-1590","title":"Impact of the International Prognostic Scoring System cytogenetic risk groups on the outcome of patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings: a retrospective analysis of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation-Chronic Malignancies Working Party","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},

A number of diagnostic criteria have been suggested in the world and not uniÔ¨Åed as single, but the most common accepted one is Mayo Clinic proposed criteria. Since the clinical presentation of TTC is usually similar to acute coronary syndrome, differential diagnosis is essential to exclude other diseases and also for its treatment.

  {"id":"oran_fludarabine_2021","abstract":"Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens developed to extend the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to older patients have resulted in encouraging outcomes. We aimed to compare the 2 most commonly used RIC regimens, i.v. fludarabine with busulfan (FluBu) and fludarabine with melphalan (FluMel), in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), we identified 1045 MDS patients age ‚â•60 years who underwent first HSCT with a matched related or matched (8/8) unrelated donor using an RIC regimen. The CIBMTR's definition of RIC was used: a regimen that incorporated an i.v. busulfan total dose ‚â§7.2 mg/kg or a low-dose melphalan total dose ‚â§150 mg/m2. The 2 groups, recipients of FluBu (n¬†=¬†697) and recipients of FluMel (n¬†=¬†448), were comparable in terms of disease- and transplantation-related characteristics except for the more frequent use of antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab in the FluBu group (39% versus 31%). The median age was 67 years in both groups. FluMel was associated with a reduced relapse incidence (RI) compared with FluBu, with a 1-year adjusted incidence of 26% versus 44%¬†(P ‚â§ .0001). Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the FluMel group (26% versus 16%; P ‚â§ .0001). Because the magnitude of improvement with FluMel in RI was greater than the improvement in TRM with FluBu, disease-free survival (DFS) was better at 1 year and beyond with FluMel compared with FluBu (48% versus 40% at 1 year [P¬†=¬†.02] and 35% versus 27% at 3 years [P¬†=¬†.01]). Overall survival was comparable in the 2 groups at 1 year (63% versus 61%; P¬†=¬†.4) but was significantly improved with FluMel compared with FluBu at 3 years (46% versus 39%; P¬†=¬†.03). Our results suggest that FluMel is associated with superior DFS compared with FluBu owing to reduced RI in older patients with MDS patients. ¬© 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

Between 2009 and 2017, a total of 187 patients aged 18 to 75 years were entered into a randomized controlled study of posttransplant azacitidine if they were in complete remission. Patients randomized to the treatment arm (n = 93) were scheduled to receive azacitidine, given as 32 mg/m2 per day subcutaneously for 5 days every 28 days for 12 cycles. The control arm (n = 94) had no intervention. Eighty-seven of the 93 patients started azacitidine maintenance. The median number of cycles received was 4; a total of 29 patients relapsed on study, and 23 patients withdrew from the study due to toxicity, patient's preference, or logistical reasons. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 2.07 years in the azacitidine group vs 1.28 years in the control group (P = .43). There was also no significant difference for overall survival, with a median of 2.52 years vs 2.56 years in the azacitidine and control groups (P = .85), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed no improvement in RFS or overall survival with the use of azacitidine as maintenance compared with the control group (hazard ratios of 0.73 [95% confidence interval, 0.49-1.1; P = .14] and 0.84 [95% confidence interval, 0.55-1.29; P = .43]) [corrected]. This randomized trial with azacitidine maintenance showed that a prospective trial in the posttransplant setting was feasible and safe but challenging. Although RFS was comparable between the 2 arms, we believe the strategy of maintenance therapy merits further study with a goal to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with AML/MDS.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents a particularly important cardiovascular complication in cancer patients. With cardio-vascular risk factors becoming more prevalent in an aging cancer population that is surviving longer, questions pertaining to the appropriate management of vascular toxicity are likely to assume even greater value in the coming years.

Experimental Design: We analyzed tumor biopsies from seven patients obtained before, during, and/or after treatment with AZD9291 or rociletinib (CO-1686). Targeted sequencing and FISH analyses were performed, and the relevance of candidate genes was functionally assessed in in vitro models. Results: We found recurrent amplification of either MET or ERBB2 in tumors that were resistant or developed resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and show that ERBB2 and MET activation can confer resistance to these compounds. Furthermore, we identified a KRASG12S mutation in a patient with acquired resistance to AZD9291 as a potential driver of acquired resistance. Finally, we show that dual inhibition of EGFR/MEK might be a viable strategy to overcome resistance in EGFR-mutant cells expressing mutant KRAS. Conclusions: Our data suggest that heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance can drive primary and acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and provide a rationale for potential combination strategies.

The two broad histological subtypes of lung cancer are small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is the cause of 15% of cases, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 85% of cases and includes adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma. Although NSCLC and SCLC are commonly thought to be different diseases owing to their distinct biology and genomic abnormalities, the idea that these malignant disorders might share common cells of origin has been gaining support. This idea has been supported by the unexpected findings that a subset of NSCLCs with mutated EGFR return as SCLC when resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors develops. Additionally, other case reports have described the coexistence of NSCLC and SCLC, further challenging the commonly accepted view of their distinct lineages. Here, we summarise the published clinical observations and biology underlying tumours with combined SCLC and NSCLC histology and cancers that transform from adenocarcinoma to SCLC. We also discuss pre-clinical studies pointing to common potential cells of origin, and speculate how the distinct paths of differentiation are determined by the genomics of each disease.","author":[{"family":"Oser","given":"Matthew G."},{"family":"Niederst","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Engelman","given":"Jeffrey A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"oser_transformation_2015","container-title":"The Lancet.

  {"id":"ou_catalog_2020","abstract":"Abstract Since the discovery of anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion-positive (ALK+) NSCLC in 2007, the methods to detect ALK+ NSCLC have evolved and expanded from fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to next-generation DNA sequencing, targeted RNA sequencing, and whole transcriptome sequencing. As such, the deep sequencing methods have resulted in the expansion of distinct fusion partners identified in ALK+ NSCLC to 90 (one variant PLEKHM2-ALK is found in small cell lung cancer but included in this catalog) by the end of January 2020; about 65 of them (since 2018) and most of the recent novel fusion partners were reported from China. Thirty-four of the distinct fusion partners are located on the short arm of chromosome 2; 28 of these 34 fusion partners are located on 2p21-25, in which ALK is located on 2p23.2-p23.1. Many of these new ALK+ NSCLC fusion variants have responded to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Several of these novel ALK fusion variants were identified as being resistant to EGFR TKIs or as dual 3'ALK fusions. In addition, at least 28 intergenic ALK rearrangements have also been reported, with three of them reported as responding to crizotinib. This review aims to serve as a central source of reference of fusion partners in ALK+ NSCLC for clinicians and scientists. We aim to update and improve the list going forward.","author":[{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Viola W."},{"family":"Nagasaka","given":"Misako"}],"citation-key":"ou_catalog_2020","container-title":"JTO clinical and research reports","container-title-short":"JTO Clin.

  {"id":"ou_emergence_2017","abstract":"Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating EGFR mutations generally involve development of acquired secondary or tertiary EGFR mutations, such as T790M or C797S. However, case reports have demonstrated that actionable receptor tyrosine kinase fusions such as EML4-ALK, CCDC6-RET, and FGFR3-TACC3 can potentially confer resistance to EGFR TKIs. We seeked to identify the prevalence of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts as resistance mechanism to EGFR TKIs. Hybrid-capture based genomic profiling was performed on FFPE tissue samples and circulating tumor DNA isolated from peripheral whole blood in the course of clinical care. We performed a comprehensive survey of 17,319 clinical NSCLC samples (14,170 adenocarcinomas and 3149 NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS)) and identified 5 cases of FGFR3-TACC3 containing the intact kinase domain of FGFR3 and the coiled-coil domain of TACC3 emerging after treatment with EGFR TKIs, including one previously reported index case. Of the 4 novel cases of FGFR3-TACC3, one emerged after erlotinib, one after afatinib, one after osimertinib, and one after ASP8273. These 5 cases of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions acquired post-EGFR TKI, while rare, indicate that FGFR3-TACC3 is a recurrent resistance mechanism, which can bypass EGFR blockade by all generations of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC. Routine re-biopsy and genomic profiling using platforms capable of detecting kinase fusions has the potential to inform new therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC progressing on TKIs.","author":[{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"Horn","given":"Leora"},{"family":"Cruz","given":"Marcelo Rocha"},{"family":"Vafai","given":"Davood"},{"family":"Lovly","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Spradlin","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"Michael J"},{"family":"Dagogo-Jack","given":"Ibiayi"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Adrienne"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Vincent A."},{"family":"Gadgeel","given":"Shirish M."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Siraj M."},{"family":"Schrock","given":"Alexa B."}],"citation-key":"ou_emergence_2017","container-title":"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","container-title-short":"Lung Cancer Amst.

  {"id":"ou_emergence_2017a","abstract":"Acquired epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resistance mutations to osimertinib are common, including the EGFR C797S that abolishes the covalent binding of osimertinib to EGFR. Here we report the emergence of novel EGFR solvent front mutations at Gly796 (G796S/R) in addition to a hinge pocket L792F/H mutations, and C797S/G all in cis with T790M in a single patient on progression on osimertinib as detected by plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay in the course of clinical care. A 69-year-old Caucasian female former light-smoker presented with stage IV EGFR L858R positive adenocarcinoma who developed EGFR T790M mutation after 8 month treatment of erlotinib. The patient was initiated on osimertinib with disease shrinkage after 2 months, but tumor regrowth was observed after 5 months of osimertinib treatment. Assay of plasma ctDNA at this time revealed these different secondary resistance mutations all in trans with each other including distinct mutations at the same codon producing different amino acid changes: G796S/R (mutant allele frequency [MAF]; 14.4%), C797S/G (MAF: 2.26%), L792F/H (MAF: 0.36%), and V802F (MAF: 0.40%), in addition to the pre-existing L858R (MAF:17.9%) and T790M (MAF:18.2%) but all in cis with T790M. The G796S/R mutations are homologous with known reported solvent front mutations in ALK G1202R, ROS1 G2032R, TrkA G595R and TrkC G623R, all of which are associated with acquired resistance to type I TKIs. In silico modeling revealed mutation at G796 interferes with osimertinib binding to the EGFR kinase domain at the phenyl aromatic ring position as this residue forms a narrow \"hydrophobic sandwich\" with L718, while L792F/H mutation interferes with osimertinib binding at the methoxyl group on the phenyl ring. Multiple resistance mutations at differing allele frequencies including novel EGFR solvent front mutations can emerge in a single patient with progression on osimertinib potentially due to tumor hetereogeneity and definitely present a significant therapeutic and drug development challenge.","author":[{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Schrock","given":"Alexa B."},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Michael E."},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Viola W."},{"family":"Albacker","given":"Lee A."},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Philip J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Vincent A."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Siraj M."}],"citation-key":"ou_emergence_2017a","container-title":"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","container-title-short":"Lung Cancer Amst.

  {"id":"ou_will_2021","abstract":"Our current treatment paradigm of advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) classifies the six currently approved ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into three generations. The 2nd-generation (2G) and 3rd-generation (3G) ALK TKIs are all ‚Äúsingle mutant active‚Äù with varying potencies across a wide spectrum of acquired single ALK resistance mutations. There is a vigorous debate among clinicians which is the best upfront ALK TKI is for the first-line (1L) treatment of ALK+ NSCLC and the subsequent sequencing strategies whether it should be based on the presence of specific on-target ALK resistance mutations or not. Regardless, sequential use of ‚Äúsingle mutant active‚Äù ALK TKIs will eventually lead to double ALK resistance mutations in cis. This has led to the creation of fourth generation (4G) ‚Äúdouble mutant active‚Äù ALK TKIs such as TPX-0131 and NVL-655. We discuss the critical properties 4G ALK TKIs must possess to be clinically successful. We proposed conceptual first-line, second-line, and molecularly-based third-line registrational randomized clinical trials designed for these 4G ALK TKIs. How these 4G ALK TKIs would be used in the future will depend on which line of treatment the clinical trial design(s) is adopted provided the trial is positive. If approved, 4G ALK TKIs may usher in a new treatment paradigm for advanced ALK+ NSCLC that is based on classifying ALK TKIs based on the intrinsic functional capabilities (‚Äúsinge mutant active‚Äù versus ‚Äúdouble mutant active‚Äù) rather than the loosely-defined ‚Äúgenerational‚Äù (first-, second-,third-,fourth-) classification and avoid the current clinical approaches of seemingly random sequential use of 2G and 3G ALK TKIs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"Nagasaka","given":"Misako"},{"family":"Brazel","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Yujie"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Viola W."}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"ou_will_2021","container-title":"Translational Oncology","container-title-short":"Translational Oncology","DOI":"10.1016/j.tranon.2021.101191","ISSN":"1936-5233","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"page":"101191","source":"5","title":"Will the clinical development of 4th-generation ‚Äúdouble mutant active‚Äù ALK TKIs (TPX-0131 and NVL-655) change the future treatment paradigm of ALK+ NSCLC?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936523321001832","volume":"14"},

Acquired resistance to osimertinib is a growing clinical challenge that is poorly understood. Objective To understand the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib and their clinical behavior. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients with advanced NSCLC who received osimertinib for T790M-positive acquired resistance to prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor were identified from a multi-institutional cohort (n = 143) and a confirmatory trial cohort (NCT01802632) (n = 110). Next-generation sequencing of tumor biopsies after osimertinib resistance was performed. Genotyping of plasma cell-free DNA was studied as an orthogonal approach, including serial plasma samples when available. The study and analysis were finalized on November 9, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Mechanisms of resistance and their association with time to treatment discontinuation on osimertinib. Results Of the 143 patients evaluated, 41 (28 [68%] women) had tumor next-generation sequencing after acquired resistance to osimertinib. Among 13 patients (32%) with maintained T790M at the time of resistance,EGFRC797S was seen in 9 patients (22%). Among 28 individuals (68%) with loss of T790M, a range of competing resistance mechanisms was detected, including novel mechanisms such as acquiredKRASmutations and targetable gene fusions. Time to treatment discontinuation was shorter in patients with T790M loss (6.1 vs 15.2 months), suggesting emergence of pre-existing resistant clones; this finding was confirmed in a validation cohort of 110 patients with plasma cell-free DNA genotyping performed after osimertinib resistance. In studies of serial plasma levels of mutantEGFR, loss of T790M at resistance was associated with a smaller decrease in levels of theEGFRdriver mutation after 1 to 3 weeks of therapy (100% vs 83% decrease;P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance Acquired resistance to osimertinib mediated by loss of the T790M mutation is associated with early resistance and a range of competing resistance mechanisms. These data provide clinical evidence of the heterogeneity of resistance in advanced NSCLC and a need for clinical trial strategies that can overcome multiple concomitant resistance mechanisms or strategies for preventing such resistance.","author":[{"family":"Oxnard","given":"Geoffrey R."},{"family":"Hu","given":"Yuebi"},{"family":"Mileham","given":"Kathryn Finch"},{"family":"Husain","given":"Hatim"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Tracy","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Feeney","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Sholl","given":"Lynette M."},{"family":"Dahlberg","given":"Suzanne E."},{"family":"Redig","given":"Amanda J."},{"family":"Kwiatkowski","given":"David J."},{"family":"Rabin","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Paweletz","given":"Cloud P."},{"family":"Thress","given":"Kenneth S."},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"oxnard_assessment_2018","container-title":"JAMA oncology","container-title-short":"JAMA Oncol.","DOI":"10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.2969","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1527-1534","source":"28.4","title":"Assessment of Resistance Mechanisms and Clinical Implications in Patients With EGFR T790M-Positive Lung Cancer and Acquired Resistance to Osimertinib.","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

Dose-limiting toxicities were reported in the selumetinib 25 mg (n = 1), 50 mg (n = 1), and 75 mg (n = 4) continuous-dose groups, savolitinib 600 mg (n = 1) and 800 mg dose groups (n = 2), and durvalumab 10 mg/kg (n = 1) dose group. The objective response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval 26% to 59%), 44% (22% to 69%), and 43% (23% to 66%) in the selumetinib, savolitinib, and durvalumab arms, respectively. Conclusion Our results demonstrate the feasibility of combining osimertinib 80 mg with selumetinib or savolitinib at identified tolerable, active doses. A combination of osimertinib with durvalumab was not feasible due to increased reporting of interstitial lung disease. Osimertinib-based combination therapies represent a compelling approach now being further investigated.

  {"id":"oyakawa_effect_2018","abstract":"Objective: To determine the effect of switching from the initial direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) to another DOAC on exacerbation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with advanced cancer who experienced exacerbated DVT during initial treatment with DOAC due to new venous thromboembolism (VTE). After switching to another DOAC for VTE recurrence, changes in the thrombus and bleeding were evaluated for 3 months. Eighteen patients met these criteria. We compared the effect of anticoagulant switching on the switched-drug group in those 18 patients with the effect of no anticoagulant switching on the single-drug group of patients (n=78) with a similar background.\nResults: The recurrence rate of VTE in the switched-drug group was 6%. Non-major bleeding occurred in 11% of patients. Recurrent VTE occurred in 6% of patients in both the switched-drug and single-drug groups, respectively [risk ratio (RR): 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11‚Äì7.6]. Non-major bleeding occurred in 11% and 14% of patients in the switched-drug and single-drug groups, respectively (RR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.19‚Äì3.2).\nConclusion: Switching DOAC may be a treatment option for exacerbation of DVT in patients with advanced cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Oyakawa","given":"Takuya"},{"family":"Muraoka","given":"Nao"},{"family":"Iida","given":"Kei"},{"family":"Kusuhara","given":"Masatoshi"}],"citation-key":"oyakawa_effect_2018","container-title":"Annals of Vascular Diseases","container-title-short":"Annals of Vascular Diseases","DOI":"10.3400/avd.oa.18-00072","ISSN":"1881-641X, 1881-6428","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,25]]},"language":"en","page":"531-534","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of Switching from the Initial Direct Oral Anticoagulant to Another One on Exacerbation of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer: A Retrospective Study","title-short":"Effect of Switching from the Initial Direct Oral Anticoagulant to Another One on Exacerbation of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/avd/11/4/11_oa.18-00072/_article","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"oyakawa_use_2019","abstract":"Background‚ÄÇ The efficacy of direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Japanese patients with advanced cancer is largely unknown.\nMethods‚ÄÇ This prospective single-center observational study enrolled Japanese patients with unresectable advanced cancer who started DOAC treatment for new-onset VTE between December 2015 and May 2018. Patients were followed for 3 months to evaluate bleeding and VTE recurrences. The primary study endpoint was major and non-major bleeding.\nResults‚ÄÇ One hundred and forty-five of 147 enrolled patients were analyzed. Of these, 8 [5.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8‚Äì10.5] and 29 patients (20%, 95% CI 14.3‚Äì27.2) experienced major and non-major bleeding, respectively. Patients with bleeding were more likely to have a poor performance status (PS) [hazard rate (HR) 2.04, 95% CI 1.15‚Äì3.63] and more frequent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (HR 2.75, 95% CI 1.62‚Äì4.67) relative to those without bleeding. In a multivariate analysis, combined DOAC and NSAID use correlated significantly with bleeding (odds ratio 4.63, 95% CI 1.70‚Äì12.9, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003).

We evaluated long-term efficacy and safety of first-line ibrutinib-based therapy in patients with CLL bearing TP53 aberrations in a pooled analysis across four studies: PCYC-1122e, RESONATE-2 (PCYC-1115/16), iLLUMINATE (PCYC-1130) and ECOG-ACRIN E1912. The pooled analysis included 89 patients with TP53 aberrations receiving first-line treatment with single-agent ibrutinib (n=45) or ibrutinib in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody (n=44). All 89 patients had del(17p) (53% of 89 patients) and/or TP53 mutation (91% of 58 patients with TP53 sequencing results available). With a median follow-up of 49¬∑8months (range, 0¬∑1-95¬∑9), median progression-free survival was not reached.

  {"id":"pailler_acquired_2019","abstract":"Purpose: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients inevitably develop resistance to ALK-inhibitors. New diagnostic strategies are needed to assess resistance mechanisms and provide patients with the most effective therapy. We asked whether single-circulating tumor cell (CTC) sequencing can inform on resistance mutations to ALK-inhibitors and underlying tumor heterogeneity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Experimental Design: Resistance mutations were investigated in CTCs isolated at the single-cell level from patients at disease progression on crizotinib (n=14) or lorlatinib (n=3). Three strategies including filter laser-capture microdissection, fluorescence activated cell-sorting and the DEPArray were used. 126 CTC-pools and 56 single-CTCs were isolated and sequenced. Hotspots regions over 48 cancer-related genes and 14 ALK mutations were examined to identify ALK-independent and ALK-dependent resistance mechanisms. Results: Multiple mutations in various genes in ALK-independent pathways were predominantly identified in CTCs of crizotinib-resistant patients. The RTK-KRAS (EGFR, KRAS,BRAF genes) and TP53 pathways were recurrently mutated. In one lorlatinib-resistant patient, two single-CTCs out of 12 harbored ALK compound-mutations. CTC-1 harbored the ALKG1202R/F1174C compound-mutation virtually similar to ALKG1202R/F1174L present in the corresponding tumor biopsy. CTC-10 harbored a second ALKG1202R/T1151M compound-mutation not detected in the tumor biopsy. By copy-number analysis, CTC-1 and the tumor biopsy had similar profiles while CTC-10 harbored multiple copy-number alterations and whole-genome duplication. Conclusions: Our results highlight the genetic heterogeneity and clinical utility of CTCs to identify therapeutic resistance mutations in ALK-rearranged patients. Single-CTC sequencing may be a unique tool to assess heterogeneous resistance mechanisms and help clinicians for treatment personalization and resistance options to ALK-targeted therapies.","author":[{"family":"Pailler","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Faugeroux","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Oulhen","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Mezquita","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Laporte","given":"MÁüálanie"},{"family":"HonorÁüá","given":"AurÁüálie"},{"family":"LÁüácluse","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Queffelec","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Ngo-Camus","given":"Maud"},{"family":"Nicotra","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Remon","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Lacroix","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Planchard","given":"David"},{"family":"Friboulet","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Besse","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Farace","given":"FranÁôüoise"}],"citation-key":"pailler_acquired_2019","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

We combined the International Staging System (ISS) with chromosomal abnormalities (CA) detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization after CD138 plasma cell purification and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to evaluate their prognostic value in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from 4,445 patients with NDMM enrolled onto 11 international trials were pooled together. The K-adaptive partitioning algorithm was used to define the most appropriate subgroups with homogeneous survival.\nRESULTS: ISS, CA, and LDH data were simultaneously available in 3,060 of 4,445 patients. We defined the following three groups: revised ISS (R-ISS) I (n = 871), including ISS stage I (serum Œ≤2-microglobulin level < 3.5 mg/L and serum albumin level ‚â• 3.5 g/dL), no high-risk CA [del(17p) and/or t(4;14) and/or t(14;16)], and normal LDH level (less than the upper limit of normal range); R-ISS III (n = 295), including ISS stage III (serum Œ≤2-microglobulin level > 5.5 mg/L) and high-risk CA or high LDH level; and R-ISS II (n = 1,894), including all the other possible combinations. At a median follow-up of 46 months, the 5-year OS rate was 82% in the R-ISS I, 62% in the R-ISS II, and 40% in the R-ISS III groups; the 5-year PFS rates were 55%, 36%, and 24%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The R-ISS is a simple and powerful prognostic staging system, and we recommend its use in future clinical studies to stratify patients with NDMM effectively with respect to the relative risk to their survival.","author":[{"family":"Palumbo","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Avet-Loiseau","given":"Herv√©"},{"family":"Oliva","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Lokhorst","given":"Henk M."},{"family":"Goldschmidt","given":"Hartmut"},{"family":"Rosinol","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Caltagirone","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Lahuerta","given":"Juan Jos√©"},{"family":"Facon","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Bringhen","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Gay","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Attal","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Passera","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Spencer","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Offidani","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Shaji"},{"family":"Musto","given":"Pellegrino"},{"family":"Lonial","given":"Sagar"},{"family":"Petrucci","given":"Maria T."},{"family":"Orlowski","given":"Robert Z."},{"family":"Zamagni","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Gareth"},{"family":"Dimopoulos","given":"Meletios A."},{"family":"Durie","given":"Brian G.

  {"id":"pan_preliminary_2023","abstract":"Zero-shot dialogue understanding aims to enable dialogue to track the user's needs without any training data, which has gained increasing attention. In this work, we investigate the understanding ability of ChatGPT for zero-shot dialogue understanding tasks including spoken language understanding (SLU) and dialogue state tracking (DST). Experimental results on four popular benchmarks reveal the great potential of ChatGPT for zero-shot dialogue understanding. In addition, extensive analysis shows that ChatGPT benefits from the multi-turn interactive prompt in the DST task but struggles to perform slot filling for SLU. Finally, we summarize several unexpected behaviors of ChatGPT in dialogue understanding tasks, hoping to provide some insights for future research on building zero-shot dialogue understanding systems with Large Language Models (LLMs).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pan","given":"Wenbo"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Qiguang"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Che","given":"Wanxiang"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Libo"}],"citation-key":"pan_preliminary_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2304.04256","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,9]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2304.04256","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Preliminary Evaluation of ChatGPT for Zero-shot Dialogue Understanding","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04256"},
  {"id":"pandeyavinashc._outcomes_2019","abstract":"Background: Outcomes based on liquid biopsy in poor performance, older, biopsy-ineligible advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are unknown. Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients treated on the basis of liquid biopsy to determine the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status. Objectives: The objective was to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated based on EGFR mutation status, determined on a liquid biopsy. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective audit of prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent liquid biopsy EGFR mutation testing between July 2017 and January 2019 and received treatment based on that report. The primary end point was PFS defined as duration between the date of sample collection and disease progression or death, whereas OS was calculated as the interval between the date of sample collection and death. KaplanÔøΩÂ≤ûeier survival was used for the above two end points. Results: Out of 28 patients, 11 (39%) were EGFR mutation positive, and 17 (61%) were EGFR mutation negative. The median age was 62 years, with 15 out of the 28 being females (54%). Nine (82%) and 13 (76%) patients had performance status (PS) 2 or 3 in the EGFR mutation-positive and EGFR mutation-negative cohorts, respectively. In the EGFR mutation-positive cohort, 4 (36%) were exon 19, 6 (54%) were exon 21, and 1 (9%) was T790M positive. After receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors or physician's choice of chemotherapy in EGFR mutation-positive and negative cohorts, the response rates were 63% and 12%, respectively. The median follow-up was 14 months (range: 10ÔøΩÔøΩ17 months). The median PFS was 8 months versus 2 months (P = 0.002), whereas the median OS was 17 months versus 5 months (P = 0.004) in the EGFR mutation-positive and EGFR mutation-negative cohorts, respectively. Conclusion: In patients with advanced NSCLC in whom a tissue biopsy is not feasible, especially in older, poor PS patients, treatment based on the results of liquid biopsy gives comparable outcomes to those of a tissue-based biopsy.","author":[{"family":"Pandey Avinash C.","given":""},{"family":"Dutt","given":"Sarjana"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Anjana"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Shivkant"}],"citation-key":"pandeyavinashc._outcomes_2019","container-title":"Cancer Research, Statistics, and Treatment","container-title-short":"Cancer Res.

  {"id":"pao_egf_2004","abstract":"Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor. In-frame deletions occur in exon 19, whereas point mutations occur frequently in codon 858 (exon 21). We found from sequencing the EGFR TK domain that 7 of 10 gefitinib-sensitive tumors had similar types of alterations; no mutations were found in eight gefitinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.004). Five of seven tumors sensitive to erlotinib (Tarceva), a related kinase inhibitor for which the clinically relevant target is undocumented, had analogous somatic mutations, as opposed to none of 10 erlotinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.003). Because most mutation-positive tumors were adenocarcinomas from patients who smoked <100 cigarettes in a lifetime (\"never smokers\"), we screened EGFR exons 2-28 in 15 adenocarcinomas resected from untreated never smokers. Seven tumors had TK domain mutations, in contrast to 4 of 81 non-small cell lung cancers resected from untreated former or current smokers (P = 0.0001). Immunoblotting of lysates from cells transiently transfected with various EGFR constructs demonstrated that, compared to wild-type protein, an exon 19 deletion mutant induced diminished levels of phosphotyrosine, whereas the phosphorylation at tyrosine 1092 of an exon 21 point mutant was inhibited at 10-fold lower concentrations of drug. Collectively, these data show that adenocarcinomas from never smokers comprise a distinct subset of lung cancers, frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity.","author":[{"family":"Pao","given":"William"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Vincent A."},{"family":"Zakowski","given":"Maureen F."},{"family":"Doherty","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Politi","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Sarkaria","given":"Inderpal S."},{"family":"Singh","given":"Bhuvanesh"},{"family":"Heelan","given":"Robert T."},{"family":"Rusch","given":"Valerie W."},{"family":"Fulton","given":"Lucinda"},{"family":"Mardis","given":"Elaine R."},{"family":"Kupfer","given":"Doris M."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Richard K."},{"family":"Kris","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Varmus","given":"Harold E."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"pao_egf_2004","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"papageorgiou_monoclonal_2022","abstract":"Although rituximab has revolutionized the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a significant proportion of patients experience refractory disease or relapse early after the end of treatment. The lack of effective treatment options in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) setting had made the prognosis of these patients dismal. The initial enthusiasm for novel anti-CD20 antibodies had been short-lived as they failed to prove their superiority to rituximab. Therefore, research has focused on developing novel agents with a unique mechanism of action. Among them, two antibody-drug conjugates, namely polatuzumab vedotin (PolaV) and loncastuximab tesirine, along with tafasitamab, an anti-CD19 bioengineered antibody, have been approved for the treatment of R/R DLBCL. Whereas PolaV has been FDA and EMA approved, EMA has not approved loncastuximab tesirine and tafasitamab yet. Results from randomized trials, as well as real-life data for PolaV have been promising. Novel agents as bispecific antibodies bridging CD3 on T-cells to CD20 have shown very promising results in clinical trials and are expected to gain approval for treatment of R/R DLBCL soon. As the therapeutic armamentarium against DLBCL is expanding, an improvement in survival of patients with R/R and higher cure rates might soon become evident.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Papageorgiou","given":"Sotirios G."},{"family":"Thomopoulos","given":"Thomas P."},{"family":"Liaskas","given":"Athanasios"},{"family":"Vassilakopoulos","given":"Theodoros P."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"papageorgiou_monoclonal_2022","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers14081917","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"8","page":"1917","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"6.575","title":"Monoclonal Antibodies in the Treatment of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: Moving beyond Rituximab","title-short":"Monoclonal Antibodies in the Treatment of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/8/1917","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"park_activation_2016","abstract":"Mutant-selective, 3rd-generation EGFR-TKIs were recently developed to control lung cancer cells harboring T790M-mediated resistance. However, the development of resistance to these novel drugs seems inevitable. Thus, we investigated the mechanism of acquired resistance to the mutant-selective EGFR-TKI WZ4002. We established five WZ4002-resistant cells, derived from cells harboring both EGFR and T790M mutations by long-term exposure to increasing doses of WZ4002. Compared with the parental cells, all resistant cells showed 10-100-folds higher resistance to WZ4002, as well as cross-resistance to other mutant-selective inhibitors. Among them, three resistant cells (HCC827/WR, PC-9/WR and H1975/WR) showed dependency on EGFR signaling, but two other cells (PC-9/GR/WR and PC-9/ER/WR) were not. Notably, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) was aberrantly activated in PC-9/GR/WR cells in phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array, consistently accompanied by loss of IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP3). Down-regulation of IGF1R by shRNA, as well as inhibition of IGF1R activity either by AG-1024 (a small molecule IGF1R inhibitor) or BI 836845 (a monoclonal anti-IGF1/2 blocking antibody), restored the sensitivity to WZ4002 both in vitro and xenograft. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of the IGF1R pathway associated with IGFBP3 loss can induce an acquired resistance to the mutant-selective EGFR-TKI, WZ4002. Therefore, a combined therapy of IGF1R inhibitors and mutant-selective EGFR-TKIs might be a viable treatment strategy for overcoming acquired resistance.","author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Ji Hyun"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Yun Jung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Seon Ye"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jung-Eun"},{"family":"Sung","given":"Ki Jung"},{"family":"Park","given":"Sojung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Woo Sung"},{"family":"Song","given":"Joon Seon"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Chang-Min"},{"family":"Sung","given":"Young Hoon"},{"family":"Rho","given":"Jin Kyung"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jae Cheol"}],"citation-key":"park_activation_2016","container-title":"Oncotarget","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.8013","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"22005-22015","title":"Activation of the IGF1R pathway potentially mediates acquired resistance to mutant-selective 3rd-generation EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"park_clinical_2018","abstract":"Many patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) experience anaemia, which has negative consequences. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and their biosimilars are used to treat anaemia in MDS and, currently, epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are commonly used and recommended by clinical guidelines. To better understand the evidence available on the use of ESAs for anaemia in lower-risk MDS, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify randomized and nonrandomized prospective studies reporting on clinical efficacy/effectiveness, patient-reported quality of life (QoL), and safety. We extended our review to include retrospective studies for darbepoetin alfa specifically and to ascertain the feasibility of completing an indirect network meta-analysis comparing epoetin and darbepoetin alfa. Overall, 53 articles reporting on 35 studies were included. The studies indicated a clinical benefit of ESAs, with benefits observed across key clinical outcomes. ESAs showed consistent improvement in erythroid response rates (ESA-naive, 45-73%; previous ESA exposure, 25-75%) and duration of response. Comparative studies demonstrated similar progression to acute myeloid leukaemia and several showed improved overall survival and QoL. Limited safety concerns were identified. This analysis confirmed ESA therapy should be the foremost first-line treatment of anaemia in most patients with lower-risk MDS who lack the 5q deletion.","author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Yucel","given":"Aylin"},{"family":"Farmer","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"O'Neill","given":"Frank"},{"family":"De","given":"Oliveira Brandao Cisio"},{"family":"Fenaux","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"park_clinical_2018","container-title":"British journal of haematology","container-title-short":"Br.

Osimertinib (80 mg), a third-generation, irreversible, oral EGFR TKI, has shown efficacy in active CNS metastases. However, efficacy of osimertinib 160 mg in BM or LM is unclear. Patients and methods This prospective, single-arm, two cohort study evaluated the efficacy of osimertinib 160 mg in T790M-positive BM or LM NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR TKI (NCT03257124) treatment. The primary end points were objective response rate (ORR) (H1 = 30%) for the BM cohort and overall survival (OS) (H1 = 5 months) for the LM cohort. Results The median follow-up duration was 10.1 months and 9.6 months for the BM and LM cohorts, respectively. In the BM cohort, intracranial ORR and disease control rate were 55.0% and 77.5%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.0ÔøΩÔøΩ16.6]; the median OS was 16.9 months [95% CI 7.9ÔøΩÂøõot reached (NR)].

We performed immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization on 73 ALK-negative ALCLs and 32 ALK-positive ALCLs and evaluated the associations among pathology, genetics, and clinical outcome. Chromosomal rearrangements of DUSP22 and TP63 were identified in 30% and 8% of ALK-negative ALCLs, respectively. These rearrangements were mutually exclusive and were absent in ALK-positive ALCLs. Five-year overall survival rates were 85% for ALK-positive ALCLs, 90% for DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs, 17% for TP63-rearranged ALCLs, and 42% for cases lacking all 3 genetic markers (P &lt; .0001).

  {"id":"pasquale_comparative_1986","abstract":"Bone marrow aspirate particle smears, biopsy imprints, and biopsy sections were compared to determine the accuracy of the three samples in assessing for overall cellularity, differential cell count, megakaryocyte density, iron stores, and tumor infiltration. Aspirate particle smears and biopsy imprints were stained by Wright-Giemsa method. Aspirate particle smears were also stained with Prussian-blue. Biopsy sections were 1 1/2-2 micron thick and were prepared from non-decalcified plastic embedded samples and stained with combined Prussian-blue-hematoxylin-eosin, and Giemsa. One hundred-eight sets of specimens from 99 patients were examined. In 20 cases, chi-square analysis showed a comparable degree of cellularity (p less than 0.001) and megakaryocyte density (p less than 0.001) among the three preparations. Differential count comparison by regression analysis indicated that mean percentages of neutrophilic cells in the proliferation compartment were comparable in the three groups (p less than 0.01). A better correlation was obtained among the three groups in the percent neutrophilic cells in the maturation-storage compartment, normoblasts, eosinophils, and plasma cells (p less than 0.001). Lymphocytes in the aspirate smears correlated with the biopsy imprints (p less than 0.01) but not with the biopsy sections (p greater than 0.05). Monocytes did not correlate in any of the groups (p greater than 0.05). In 47 cases, chi-square analysis of iron stores in the aspirate particle smears correlated well with those in the biopsy sections (p less than 0.001). Fifty-two marrows that were done for staging nonhematological malignancies revealed malignant cells in 21 cases, biopsy sections were positive in all, biopsy imprints were positive in 19 (90%), and aspirate particle smears were positive in 7 (33%). Thirty-six marrows done for staging non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed malignant cells in 13 cases. Twelve (92%) biopsy sections, three (23%) biopsy imprints, and nine (69%) aspirate particle smears contained lymphoma cells. In conclusion, a satisfactory evaluation of marrow samples for diagnostic studies can be achieved by examination of biopsy sections along with aspirate particle smears or biopsy imprints. Any of the three marrow preparations alone is not sufficient for accurate diagnosis in all cases. The biopsy imprint is an accurate modality for identifying nonhematological tumor metastasis in the bone marrow.","author":[{"family":"Pasquale","given":"D."},{"family":"Chikkappa","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"pasquale_comparative_1986","container-title":"American Journal of Hematology","container-title-short":"Am J Hematol","DOI":"10.1002/ajh.2830220407","ISSN":"0361-8609","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"381-389","PMID":"3728456","source":"PubMed","title":"Comparative evaluation of bone marrow aspirate particle smears, biopsy imprints, and biopsy sections","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

In this study, we investigated whether ALK, which is expressed at high levels in lymphoma cells, could be a target for antigen-specific cell-mediated immunotherapy. A panel of ALK-derived peptides was tested for their binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules. Binding peptides were assessed for their capacity to elicit a specific immune response mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) both in vivo, in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice, and in vitro in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy donors. Two HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes, p280-89 (SLAMLDLLHV) and p375-86 (GVLLWEIFSL), both located in the ALK kinase domain were identified. The p280-89- and p375-86-induced peptide-specific CTL lines were able to specifically release interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on stimulation with ALK peptide-pulsed autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells (LCLs) or T2 cells. Anti-ALK CTLs lysed HLA-matched ALCL and neuroblastoma cell lines endogenously expressing ALK proteins. CTL activity was inhibited by anti-HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody CR11.351, consistent with a class I-restricted mechanism of cytotoxicity. These results show the existence of functional anti-ALK CTL precursors within the peripheral T-cell repertoire of healthy donors, clearly indicating ALK as a tumor antigen and ALK-derived peptides, p280-89 and p375-86, as suitable epitopes for the development of vaccination strategies.","author":[{"family":"Passoni","given":"Lorena"},{"family":"Scardino","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Bertazzoli","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Gallo","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Coluccia","given":"Addolorata"},{"family":"Lemonnier","given":"FranÁôüois"},{"family":"Kosmatopoulos","given":"Konstadinos"},{"family":"Gambacorti-Passerini","given":"Carlo"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"passoni_alk_2002","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.v99.6.2100","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"2100-2106","source":"20.3","title":"ALK as a novel lymphoma-associated tumor antigen: identification of 2 HLA-A2.1-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitopes.","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"patel_phase_2020","abstract":"Lessons learned This study evaluating first-line crizotinib plus pembrolizumab in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was terminated early because increased availability of second-generation ALK inhibitors resulted in difficulty identifying and accruing eligible patients. In the small number of patients enrolled, elevated transaminases were the most common treatment-related toxicity. No other relevant toxicities were observed. Although no definitive conclusions could be drawn because of the small number of patients studied, the higher frequency of severe transaminase increases noted in this sample should be of concern if ALK inhibitor and PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitor combinations are tested in future studies. Background Previous research suggests single-agent crizotinib is efficacious for the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods This study evaluated the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of crizotinib plus pembrolizumab as first-line therapy in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Patients were initially treated at dose level 0 (DL0) with crizotinib 250 mg twice daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (cycle duration was 3 weeks). If a dose-limiting toxicity occurred, subsequent patients were enrolled at a lower dose level (dose level -1 [DL-1]: 3 weeks of crizotinib monotherapy 250 mg twice daily, followed by crizotinib 250 mg twice daily with the addition of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity. Antitumor activity was assessed. Results Nine patients were enrolled: two at DL0, then seven at DL-1. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in four patients (grade 3 increases in alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and grade 3 fatigue at DL0; grade 3 increase in ALT and grade 3 increases in both ALT and AST at DL-1).

Methods: Two were evaluated in subjects with advanced solid tumors, single agent PY314 and PY314 in combination with 200 mg of pembrolizumab using a 3+3 dose escalation study design. Dosing was intravenous and administered once every 3-weeks, a defined cycle. Disease assessment by RECIST 1.1 was performed every 6 weeks. Each stratum included 4 dose levels of PY314 (1, 3, 10, and 20 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetics were evaluated at specified time points. Archival tumor tissue was analyzed for TREM2 expression by immunohistochemistry. Based on preclinical evaluation of TREM2 expression, HR+ HER2- and triple negative breast cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and gynecologic cancers were studied. Results: 28 subjects (median age 60 years [range 26-76], 22 females and 6 ) with an ECOG PS <2 were enrolled and all, but one was (1 subject withdrew consent after dosing). 15 subjects were treated with single agent PY314 and 13 were treated with the combination.

  {"id":"pauli_challenging_2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: CUPISCO is an ongoing randomized phase II trial (NCT03498521) comparing molecularly guided therapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients newly diagnosed with \"unfavorable\" cancer of unknown primary (CUP).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with an unfavorable CUP diagnosis, as defined by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and available cancer tissue for molecular sequencing are generally eligible. Potential patients with CUP entering screening undergo a review involving reference histopathology and clinical work-up by a central eligibility review team (ERT). Patients with \"favorable\" CUP, a strongly suspected primary site of origin, lack of tissue, or unmet inclusion criteria are excluded.\nRESULTS: As of April 30, 2020, 628 patients had entered screening and 346 (55.1%) were screen failed. Screen fails were due to technical reasons (n =‚Äâ89), failure to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria not directly related to CUP diagnosis (n =‚Äâ89), and other reasons (n =‚Äâ33). A total of 124 (35.8%) patients were excluded because unfavorable adeno- or poorly differentiated CUP could not be confirmed by the ERT. These cases were classified into three groups ineligible because of (a) histologic subtype, such as squamous and neuroendocrine, or favorable CUP; (b) evidence of a possible primary tumor; or (c) noncarcinoma histology.\nCONCLUSION: Experience with CUPISCO has highlighted challenges with standardized screening in an international clinical trial and the difficulties in diagnosing unfavorable CUP. Reconfirmation of unfavorable CUP by an ERT in a clinical trial can result in many reasons for screen failures. By sharing this experience, we aim to foster understanding of diagnostic challenges and improve diagnostic pathology and clinical CUP algorithms.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A high unmet need exists for improved treatment of cancer of unknown primary (CUP); however, study in a trial setting is faced with the significant challenge of definitively distinguishing CUP from other cancer types. This article reports the authors' experience of this challenge so far in the ongoing CUPISCO trial, which compares treatments guided by patients' unique genetic signatures versus standard chemotherapy. The data presented will aid future decision-making regarding diagnosing true CUP cases; this will have far-reaching implications in the design, execution, and interpretation of not only CUPISCO but also future clinical studies aiming to find much-needed treatment strategies.","author":[{"family":"Pauli","given":"Chantal"},{"family":"Bochtler","given":"Tilmann"},{"family":"Mileshkin","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Baciarello","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Losa","given":"Ferran"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Jeffrey S."},{"family":"Pentheroudakis","given":"George"},{"family":"Zarkavelis","given":"George"},{"family":"Yalcin","given":"Suayib"},{"family":"√ñzg√ºroƒülu","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Beringer","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Scarato","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Mueller-Ohldach","given":"Mathis"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Marlene"},{"family":"Moch","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Kr√§mer","given":"Alwin"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"pauli_challenging_2021","container-title":"The Oncologist","container-title-short":"Oncologist","DOI":"10.1002/onco.13744","ISSN":"1549-490X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5]]},"language":"en-US","page":"e769-e779","PMCID":"PMC8100559","PMID":"33687747","source":"5.8","title":"A Challenging Task: Identifying Patients with Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP) According to ESMO Guidelines: The CUPISCO Trial Experience","title-short":"A Challenging Task","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

In order to evaluate the most effective testing approach for LuAD targetable gene fusion detection, we analyzed 210 NSCLC selected clinical samples, comparing in situ (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization, FISH, and ImmunoHistoChemistry, IHC) and molecular (targeted RNA Next-Generation Sequencing, NGS, and RealTime-PCR, RT-PCR) approaches. The overall concordance among these methods was high (>90%), and targeted RNA NGS was confirmed to be the most efficient technique for gene fusion identification in clinical practice, allowing the simultaneous analysis of a large set of genomic rearrangements at the RNA level. However, we observed that FISH was useful to detect targetable fusions in those samples with inadequate tissue material for molecular testing as well as in those few cases whose fusions were not identified by the RNA NGS panel. We conclude that the targeted RNA NGS analysis of LuADs allows accurate RTK fusion detection; nevertheless, standard methods such as FISH should not be dismissed, as they can crucially contribute to the completion of the molecular characterization of LuADs and, most importantly, the identification of patients as candidates for targeted therapies.","author":[{"family":"Pecciarini Lorenza","given":""},{"family":"Brunetto","given":"Emanuela"},{"family":"Grassini","given":"Greta"},{"family":"De Pascali","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Ogliari","given":"Francesca Rita"},{"family":"Talarico","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Marra","given":"Giovanna"},{"family":"Magliacane","given":"Gilda"},{"family":"Redegalli","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Arrigoni","given":"Gianluigi"},{"family":"Lazzari","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Gregorc","given":"Vanesa"},{"family":"Bulotta","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Doglioni","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Cangi","given":"Maria Giulia"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"pecciarinilorenza_gene_2023","container-title":"Cells","DOI":"10.3390/cells12081135","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"1135-1135","source":"6","title":"Gene Fusion Detection in NSCLC Routine Clinical Practice: Targeted-NGS or FISH?","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

Patients with cancer, especially during chemotherapy, are at enhanced risk, but real-world data on factors associated with VTE events are still scarce. Aim‚ÄÇ The aim of this retrospective study was to survey the incidence of VTE based on a large hospital database, and to identify comorbidities and features associated with VTE events. We focused on cancer-related VTE events and on factors indicating increased VTE risk during chemotherapy.\nMethods‚ÄÇ The cohort included patients treated at Turku University Hospital during years 2005‚Äì2013. Health information was derived and analysed from multiple electronic databases. The diagnoses of VTE and all comorbidities, including type of cancer, were based on International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision coding. For further analysis, we focused on 16 common types of cancers treated with chemotherapy. Age, gender, surgery, radiotherapy, distant metastasis, available laboratory values and platinum-based chemotherapy were evaluated for VTE group, and associations were estimated by Cox regression analyses.\nResults‚ÄÇ The entire database contained information from 495‚Äâ089 patients, of whom 5452 (1.1%) had a VTE diagnosis. Among individuals with VTE, 1437 (26.4%) had diagnosis of coronary heart disease and 1467 (26.9%) had cancer diagnosis. Among 7778 patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy, 282 (3.6%) had a VTE, platinum-based chemotherapy being a major risk factor (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.24, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, elevated blood neutrophil counts (>3.25√ó109‚Äâcells/L, HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.89, p<0.001) and plasma creatinine (>62.5 Œºmol/L; HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.13, p=0.001) values were independent indicators of increased VTE risk during chemotherapy.\nConclusions‚ÄÇ Longitudinal electronic health record analysis provides a powerful tool to gather meaningful real-world information to study clinical associations, like comorbidities, and to identify markers associated with VTE. The combination of various clinical and laboratory variables could be used for VTE risk evaluation and targeted prevention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Peippo","given":"Maija Helena"},{"family":"Kurki","given":"Samu"},{"family":"Lassila","given":"Riitta"},{"family":"Carp√©n","given":"Olli Mikael"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"peippo_realworld_2018","container-title":"ESMO Open","container-title-short":"ESMO Open","DOI":"10.1136/esmoopen-2018-000363","ISSN":"20597029","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"e000363","source":"6.883","title":"Real-world features associated with cancer-related venous thromboembolic events","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2059702920322766","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"pelliccia_pathophysiology_2017","abstract":"Originally described by Japanese authors in the 1990s, Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) generally presents as an acute myocardial infarction characterized by severe left ventricular dysfunction. TTS, however, differs from an acute coronary syndrome because patients have generally a normal coronary angiogram and left ventricular dysfunction, which extends beyond the territory subtended by a single coronary artery and recovers within days or weeks. The prognosis was initially thought to be benign, but subsequent studies have demonstrated that both short-term mortality and long-term mortality are higher than previously recognized. Indeed, mortality reported during the acute phase in hospitalized patients is ‚âà4% to 5%, a figure comparable to that of ST-segment‚Äìelevation myocardial infarction in the era of primary percutaneous coronary interventions. Despite extensive research, the cause and pathogenesis of TTS remain incompletely understood. The aim of the present review is to discuss the pathophysiology of TTS with particular emphasis on the role of the central and autonomic nervous systems. Different emotional or psychological stressors have been identified to precede the onset of TTS. The anatomic structures that mediate the stress response are found in both the central and autonomic nervous systems. Acute stressors induce brain activation, increasing bioavailability of cortisol and catecholamine. Both circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine released from adrenal medullary chromaffin cells and norepinephrine released locally from sympathetic nerve terminals are significantly increased in the acute phase of TTS. This catecholamine surge leads, through multiple mechanisms, that is, direct catecholamine toxicity, adrenoceptor-mediated damage, epicardial and microvascular coronary vasoconstriction and/or spasm, and increased cardiac workload, to myocardial damage, which has a functional counterpart of transient apical left ventricular ballooning. The relative preponderance among postmenopausal women suggests that estrogen deprivation may play a facilitating role, probably mediated by endothelial dysfunction. Despite the substantial improvement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of TTS, a number of knowledge gaps remain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Pelliccia","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Kaski","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Crea","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Camici","given":"Paolo G."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"pelliccia_pathophysiology_2017","container-title":"Circulation","container-title-short":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.027121","ISSN":"0009-7322, 1524-4539","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,13]]},"language":"en","page":"2426-2441","source":"39.918","title":"Pathophysiology of Takotsubo Syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.027121","volume":"135"},
  {"id":"pemmaraju_transform1_2023","abstract":"Background: Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) provide symptom improvement and spleen volume reduction in patients with primary, post-polycythemia vera, and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (MF). There remains a substantial unmet need for therapies that alter disease trajectory, improve outcomes, and enhance survival. The COMFORT-1 and -2 studies established JAKi monotherapy as standard-of-care with spleen volume reduction of ‚â•35% at Week 24 (SVR 35W24) of 42% and SVR 35W48 of 29%, respectively. In combination with the JAKi ruxolitinib, navitoclax, an orally available inhibitor of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 proteins (BCL-X L, BCL-2, BCL-W), was shown to have pronounced antitumor activity in patients with MF in the phase 2 REFINE trial (NCT03222609). TRANSFORM-1 is an ongoing, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international study evaluating the safety and efficacy of navitoclax plus ruxolitinib (NAV + RUX) compared with placebo plus ruxolitinib (PBO + RUX) in JAK2i-na√Øve adults with MF.Methods: TRANSFORM-1 (NCT04472598) enrolled adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF with measurable splenomegaly, evidence of MF-related symptoms, no prior JAK2i treatment, and ECOG Performance Score ‚â§2. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive NAV (starting dose of 200 mg [platelet {PLT} &gt;150 √ó 10 9/L] or 100 mg escalated to 200 mg once daily if tolerated after ‚â•7 days [PLT ‚â§150 √ó 10 9/L]) or PBO, plus RUX at label dose, based on stratification factors of intermediate-2 vs high-risk MF and PLT ‚â§200 √ó 10 9/L vs &gt;200 √ó 10 9/L. The primary endpoint was SVR 35W24. Secondary endpoints included change in total symptom score at Week 24 (TSS W24) assessed using 7-item MFSAF v4.0 (scale 0-70), SVR 35 at any time, duration of SVR 35, anemia response (per International Working Group criteria), reduction in marrow fibrosis, overall survival, leukemia-free survival, reduction in PROMIS Fatigue scale, and improvement in EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning scale. Exploratory endpoints include progression-free survival.Results: At data cutoff, April 13, 2023, 252 patients were enrolled with a median (range) follow-up of 14.9 (0.0-29.5) months; 125 patients were randomized to receive NAV + RUX and 127 to receive PBO + RUX. Most patients were male (57%), median (range) age was 69 (37-87) years, and patient demographics were similar between treatment arms ( Table 1). TRANSFORM-1 met its primary endpoint, with 79 patients (63.2%) in the NAV + RUX arm achieving SVR 35W24 compared with 40 patients (31.5%) in the PBO + RUX arm ( P&lt;0.0001). Notably, SVR 35 at any time was achieved by 96 patients (77%) with NAV + RUX compared with 53 patients (42%) with PBO + RUX. Median (range) time to SVR 35 response was 12.3 (10.1-48.3) weeks with NAV + RUX versus 12.4 (11.3-72.3) weeks with PBO + RUX. Median duration of SVR 35 was not reached (NR) in the NAV + RUX arm compared with 19.4 months (95% CI 16.8, NR) in the PBO + RUX arm. At Week 24, the mean change in TSS from baseline was -9.7 (95% CI: -11.8, -7.6) with NAV + RUX compared with -11.1 (95% CI: -13.2, -9.1) with PBO + RUX arm ( P=0.2852). Grade ‚â•3 adverse events (AEs) were experienced by 85% of patients with NAV + RUX and 70% with PBO + RUX. The most common AEs (&gt;30% of patients receiving NAV; Table 2) were thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, and neutropenia. Serious AEs were experienced by 26% of patients with NAV + RUX and 32% with PBO + RUX, including anemia (NAV + RUX: n=2; PBO + RUX: n=1), thrombocytopenia (NAV + RUX: n=2), and neutropenia (NAV + RUX: n=1). With NAV + RUX, AEs led to NAV dose reduction in 101 (81%) patients and NAV interruption in 87 (70%) patients of which 83 (67%) and 65 (52%) were due to thrombocytopenia, respectively. Of all enrolled patients, 83 (33%) discontinued study treatment; most common (&gt;5% total patients) reason for NAV/PBO discontinuation were AEs (n=32; 39% of discontinuations) and physician decision (n=14; 17% of discontinuations). In each arm, 13 (10%) patients died; 6 with NAV + RUX and 5 with PBO + RUX died ‚â§30 days post-final dose.Conclusions: This first randomized trial in JAKi-na√Øve MF with NAV + RUX combination led to an SVR 35W24 rate that was twice as high as PBO + RUX ( P&lt;0.0001). The responses were durable; AEs of thrombocytopenia and anemia were common but manageable with dose modification without any clinically significant sequalae.

  {"id":"penack_association_2020","abstract":"Elevated serum ferritin levels occur due to iron overload or during inflammation and macrophage activation. A correlation of high serum ferritin levels with increased mortality after alloSCT has been suggested by several retrospective analyses as well as by two smaller prospective studies. This prospective multicentric study aimed to study the association of ferritin serum levels before start of conditioning with alloSCT outcome. Patients with acute leukemia, lymphoma or MDS receiving a matched sibling alloSCT for the first time were considered for inclusion, regardless of conditioning. A comparison of outcomes between patients with high and low ferritin level was performed using univariate analysis and multivariate analysis using cause-specific Cox model. Twenty centers reported data on 298 alloSCT recipients. The ferritin cut off point was determined at 1500 Œºg/l (median of measured ferritin levels). In alloSCT recipients with ferritin levels above cut off measured before the start of conditioning, overall survival (HR = 2.5, CI = 1.5-4.1, p = 0.0005) and progression-free survival (HR = 2.4, CI = 1.6-3.8, p < 0.0001) were inferior. Excess mortality in the high ferritin group was due to both higher relapse incidence (HR = 2.2, CI = 1.2-3.8, p = 0.007) and increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR = 3.1, CI = 1.5-6.4, p = 0.002). NRM was driven by significantly higher infection-related mortality in the high ferritin group (HR = 3.9, CI = 1.6-9.7, p = 0.003). Acute and chronic GVHD incidence or severity were not associated to serum ferritin levels. We conclude that ferritin levels can serve as routine laboratory biomarker for mortality risk assessment before alloSCT.","author":[{"family":"Penack","given":"Olaf"},{"family":"Peczynski","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"van","given":"der Werf Steffie"},{"family":"Finke","given":"Juergen"},{"family":"Ganser","given":"Arnold"},{"family":"Schoemans","given":"H√©l√®ne"},{"family":"Pavlu","given":"Jiri"},{"family":"Niittyvuopio","given":"Riitta"},{"family":"Schroyens","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Kaynar","given":"Leylag√ºl"},{"family":"Blau","given":"Igor Wolfgang"},{"family":"van","given":"der Velden Walter J.F.M."},{"family":"Sierra","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Cortelezzi","given":"Agostino"},{"family":"Wulf","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Turlure","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Rovira","given":"Montserrat"},{"family":"√ñzkurt","given":"Z.

  {"id":"penack_association_2021","abstract":"Risk assessment of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is hindered by the lack of current data on comorbidities and outcome. The EBMT identified 38,760 allo-HCT recipients with hematologic malignancies transplanted between 2010 and 2018 from matched sibling and unrelated donors with a full data set of pre-existing comorbidities. Multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional-hazards model including known risk factors for non-relapse mortality (NRM) were performed. We found that pre-existing renal comorbidity had the strongest association with NRM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.85 [95% CI 1.55-2.19]). In addition, the association of multiple pre-existing comorbidities with NRM was significant, including diabetes, infections, cardiac comorbidity, and pulmonary comorbidity. However, the HR of the association of these comorbidities with NRM was relatively low and did not exceed 1.24. Consequently, the risk of NRM was only moderately increased in patients with a high hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) ‚â• 3 (HR 1.34 [1.26-1.42]). In the current EBMT population, pre-existing non-renal comorbidities determined NRM after allo-HCT to a much lesser extent as compared with the underlying HCT-CI data. Improvements in management and supportive care as well as higher awareness based on the use of HCT-CI may have contributed to this favorable development.","author":[{"family":"Penack","given":"Olaf"},{"family":"Peczynski","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Mohty","given":"Mohamad"},{"family":"Yakoub-Agha","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"de","given":"la C√°mara Rafael"},{"family":"Glass","given":"Bertram"},{"family":"Duarte","given":"Rafael F."},{"family":"Kr√∂ger","given":"Nicolaus"},{"family":"Schoemans","given":"H√©l√®ne"},{"family":"Koenecke","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Peric","given":"Zinaida"},{"family":"Basak","given":"Grzegorz W."}],"citation-key":"penack_association_2021","container-title":"Bone marrow transplantation","container-title-short":"Bone Marrow Transplant.","DOI":"10.1038/s41409-021-01502-8","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"1-8","title":"Association of pre-existing comorbidities with outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, LILACS, CINAHL, and SCOPUS for prospective or retrospective studies reporting data on overall survival for left-sided colon cancer (LCC) compared with right-sided colon cancer (RCC). STUDY SELECTION Studies were selected if: (1) side of CC was reported among variables entered into survival analysis, (2) survival information was available (overall survival [OS] was reported in the article as hazard ratio (HR) according to multivariate analysis, (3) articles were published in the English language. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were pooled using HRs for OS of LCC vs RCC according to fixed or random-effects models. Subgroup analysis and multivariate random-effects model meta-regression was also implemented adjusting for stage distribution, sample size, race, year of publication, type and quality of studies, and adjuvant chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES HRs for OS (the primary outcome measure) were pooled to provide an aggregate value. In this analysis, all HRs with 95% CIs were pooled to obtain prognostic information on the location of the primary tumor (left vs right location site of CC) independent of other common clinicopathological covariates.\nRESULTS An analysis was made from the 66 studies conducted. It included 1 437 846 patients with a median follow-up of 65 months. Left sided primary tumor location was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.84; P < .001) and this was independent of stage, race, adjuvant chemotherapy, year of study, number of participants, and quality of included studies.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on these results, CC side should be acknowledged as a criterion for establishing prognosis in all stages of disease. It should be considered when deciding treatment intensity in metastatic settings, and should represent a stratification factor for future adjuvant studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Petrelli","given":"Fausto"},{"family":"Tomasello","given":"Gianluca"},{"family":"Borgonovo","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Ghidini","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Turati","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Dallera","given":"Pierpaolo"},{"family":"Passalacqua","given":"Rodolfo"},{"family":"Sgroi","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Barni","given":"Sandro"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"petrelli_prognostic_2017","container-title":"JAMA Oncology","container-title-short":"JAMA Oncol","DOI":"10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.4227","ISSN":"2374-2437","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"211","source":"28.4","title":"Prognostic Survival Associated With Left-Sided vs Right-Sided Colon Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","title-short":"Prognostic Survival Associated With Left-Sided vs Right-Sided Colon Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://oncology.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.4227","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"pfeifer_genomic_2018","abstract":"We investigated the role of copy number alterations to refine risk stratification in adult Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph)+ ALL treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT). 97 Ph+ ALL patients (median age 41 years, range 18-64 years) within the prospective multicenter GMALL studies 06/99 (n=8) and 07/2003 (n=89) were analysed. All patients received TKI and aSCT in first complete remission (CR1). Copy number analysis was performed with SNP arrays and validated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The frequencies of recurrently deleted genes were: IKZF1, 76%, CDKN2A/2B, 45%, PAX5, 43%, BTG1, 18%, EBF1, 13%, ETV6, 5%, RB, 14%. In univariate analyses, the presence of CDKN2A/2B deletions had a negative impact on all endpoints: overall survival (p=0.023), disease free survival (p=0.012) and remission duration (p=0.036). The negative predictive value of CDKN2A/2B deletions was retained in multivariable analysis along with other factors such as timing of TKI therapy, intensity of conditioning, achieving remission after induction phase I and BTG1 deletions. We therefore conclude that acquired genomic CDKN2A/2B deletions identify a subgroup of Ph+ ALL patients, who have an inferior prognosis despite aSCT in CR1. Their poor outcome was attributable primarily to a high relapse rate after aSCT.","author":[{"family":"Pfeifer","given":"Heike"},{"family":"Raum","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Markovic","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Verena"},{"family":"Fey","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"OblÁì£nder","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Pressler","given":"Jovita"},{"family":"BÁππhm","given":"Verena"},{"family":"BrÁæπggemann","given":"Monika"},{"family":"Wunderle","given":"Lydia"},{"family":"HÁæπttmann","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"WÁì£sch","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Beck","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Stelljes","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Viardot","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Hoelzer","given":"Dieter"},{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Wolf-Karsten"},{"family":"Serve","given":"Hubert"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Christel"},{"family":"Goekbuget","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Ottmann","given":"Oliver G."},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"pfeifer_genomic_2018","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2017-07-796862","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"1464-1475","title":"Genomic CDKN2A/2B deletions in adult ph+ ALL are adverse despite allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","type":"article-journal","volume":"131"},
  {"id":"pfeifer_kinase_2007","abstract":"Acquired imatinib resistance in advanced Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) has been associated with mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of BCR-ABL. We examined the prevalence of KD mutations in newly diagnosed and imatinib-naive Ph+ ALL patients and assessed their clinical relevance in the setting of uniform frontline therapy with imatinib in combination with chemotherapy. Patients enrolled in the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) trial ADE10 for newly diagnosed elderly Ph+ ALL were retrospectively examined for the presence of BCR-ABL KD mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC), cDNA sequencing, and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A KD mutation was detected in a minor subpopulation of leukemic cells in 40% of newly diagnosed and imatinib-naive patients. At relapse, the dominant cell clone harbored an identical mutation in 90% of cases, the overall prevalence of mutations at relapse was 80%. P-loop mutations predominated and were not associated with an inferior hematologic or molecular remission rate or shorter remission duration compared with unmutated BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL mutations conferring high-level imatinib resistance are present in a substantial proportion of patients with de novo Ph+ ALL and eventually give rise to relapse. This provides a rationale for the frontline use of kinase inhibitors active against these BCR-ABL mutants.","author":[{"family":"Pfeifer","given":"Heike"},{"family":"Wassmann","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Pavlova","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Wunderle","given":"Lydia"},{"family":"Oldenburg","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Binckebanck","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Thoralf"},{"family":"Hochhaus","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Wystub","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"BrÁæπck","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Hoelzer","given":"Dieter"},{"family":"Ottmann","given":"Oliver G."}],"citation-key":"pfeifer_kinase_2007","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2006-11-052373","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","page":"727-734","title":"Kinase domain mutations of BCR-ABL frequently precede imatinib-based therapy and give rise to relapse in patients with de novo philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ph+ ALL).","type":"article-journal","volume":"110"},
  {"id":"pfeifer_randomized_2012","abstract":"Minimal residual disease (MRD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is predictive of relapse. Imatinib administration subsequent to SCT may prevent relapse, but the role of scheduling and its impact on outcome are not known. In a prospective, randomized multicenter trial, we compared the tolerability and efficacy of post-transplant imatinib administered either prophylactically (arm A; n=26) or following detection of MRD (arm B; n=29). Prophylactic imatinib significantly reduced the incidence of molecular recurrence after SCT compared with MRD-triggered imatinib (40% vs 69%; P=0.046). Median duration of PCR negativity was 26.5 and 6.8 months, respectively (P=0.065). Five-year survival in both interventional groups was high (80 and 74.5%), despite premature discontinuation of imatinib in the majority of patients because of poor tolerability. Relapse probability was significantly higher in patients who became MRD positive (P=0.017). In conclusion, post-transplant imatinib results in a low relapse rate, durable remissions and excellent long-term outcome in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL irrespective of whether it is given prophylactically or MRD-triggered. Reappearance of BCR-ABL1 transcripts early after SCT or at higher levels identifies a small subset of patients who do not benefit sufficiently from imatinib, and in whom alternative approaches should be explored.","author":[{"family":"Pfeifer","given":"Heike"},{"family":"Wassmann","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Bethge","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Dengler","given":"Jolanta"},{"family":"BornhÁì£user","given":"M."},{"family":"Stadler","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Beelen","given":"Dietrich W."},{"family":"Vucinic","given":"NA"},{"family":"Burmeister","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Stelljes","given":"M"},{"family":"Faul","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Dreger","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kiani","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"SchÁì£fer-Eckart","given":"Kerstin"},{"family":"Schwerdtfeger","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Ethan M."},{"family":"B","given":"Kubuschok"},{"family":"Horst","given":"Heinz-August"},{"family":"Gramatzki","given":"Martin"},{"family":"BrÁæπck","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Serve","given":"Hubert"},{"family":"Hoelzer","given":"Dieter"},{"family":"GÁππkbuget","given":"N."},{"family":"Ottmann","given":"Oliver G."}],"citation-key":"pfeifer_randomized_2012","container-title":"Leukemia","container-title-short":"Leukemia","DOI":"10.1038/leu.2012.352","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"1254-1262","title":"Randomized comparison of prophylactic and minimal residual disease-triggered imatinib after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"piccolo_many_2023","abstract":"Computer programming is a fundamental tool for life scientists, allowing them to carry out many essential research tasks. However, despite a variety of educational efforts, learning to write code can be a challenging endeavor for both researchers and students in life science disciplines. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it possible to translate human-language prompts to functional code, raising questions about whether these technologies can aid (or replace) life scientists' efforts to write code. Using 184 programming exercises from an introductory-bioinformatics course, we evaluated the extent to which one such model -- OpenAI's ChatGPT -- can successfully complete basic- to moderate-level programming tasks. On its first attempt, ChatGPT solved 139 (75.5%) of the exercises. For the remaining exercises, we provided natural-language feedback to the model, prompting it to try different approaches. Within 7 or fewer attempts, ChatGPT solved 179 (97.3%) of the exercises. These findings have important implications for life-sciences research and education. For many programming tasks, researchers no longer need to write code from scratch. Instead, machine-learning models may produce usable solutions. Instructors may need to adapt their pedagogical approaches and assessment techniques to account for these new capabilities that are available to the general public.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Piccolo","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Denny","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Luxton-Reilly","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Payne","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Ridge","given":"Perry G."}],"citation-key":"piccolo_many_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.13528","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,7]]},"number":"arXiv:2303.13528","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Many bioinformatics programming tasks can be automated with ChatGPT","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13528"},
  {"id":"piek_dysplastic_2001","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of (pre)neoplastic lesions in overtly normal Fallopian tubes from women predisposed to developing ovarian carcinoma. The presence of (pre)neoplastic lesions was scored in histological specimens from 12 women with a genetically determined predisposition for ovarian cancer, of whom seven tested positive for a germline BRCA1 mutation. A control group included 13 women. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of p21, p27, p53, cyclin A, cyclin D1, bcl-2, Ki67, HER-2/neu, and the oestrogen and progesterone receptors. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis on the BRCA1 locus was also assessed on dysplastic tissue by PCR studies. Of the 12 women with a predisposition for ovarian cancer, six showed dysplasia, including one case of severe dysplasia. Five harboured hyperplastic lesions and in one woman no histological aberrations were found in the Fallopian tube. No hyperplastic, dysplastic or neoplastic lesions were detected in the Fallopian tubes of control subjects. In the cases studied, morphologically normal tubal epithelium contained a higher proportion of Ki67-expressing cells (p=0.005) and lower fractions of cells expressing p21 (p<0.0001) and p27 (p=0.006) than in the control group. Even higher fractions of proliferating cells were found in dysplastic areas (p=0.07) and accumulation of p53 was observed in the severely dysplastic lesion. Expression patterns of other proteins studied, including the hormone receptors, were similar in cases and controls. One subject, a germline BRCA1 mutation carrier, showed loss of the wild-type BRCA1 allele in the severely dysplastic lesion. In conclusion, the Fallopian tubes of women predisposed to developing ovarian cancer frequently harbour dysplastic changes, accompanied by changes in cell-cycle and apoptosis-related proteins, indicating an increased risk of developing tubal cancer.","author":[{"family":"Piek","given":"J.

While the clinical activity of the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib against EGFR ins20 is unknown, preclinical studies suggest its favorable therapeutic window may allow for inhibition of EGFR isn20 at clinically-achievable doses (Hirano, Oncotarget 2015). We report the results of EA5162, a single-arm, phase II study of osimertinib 160 mg in NSCLC pts with EGFR ins20 (NCT03191149). Methods: Pts with advanced NSCLC with an EGFR ins20 mutation identified by any local, CLIA-certified tissue assay were treated with osimertinib 160 mg daily until progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal. At least one prior line of therapy was required; stable, asymptomatic brain metastases were allowed. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. The estimated sample size was 19 patients. Results: 21 pts were enrolled between 4/2018 and 7/2019 (median age 65; 15 female, 6 male; median 2 prior therapies); 1 patient did not meet eligibility criteria due to laboratory studies obtained 1 day out of window. As of 1/21/20, 6 pts remain on treatment. Among the 20 eligible pts, the best response was PR in 4 pts and CR in one pt, for a confirmed ORR of 25%; 12 (60%) pts had SD.

Finally, we treated two patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and RET-mediated resistance with osimertinib and BLU-667. The combination was well-tolerated and led to rapid radiographic response in both patients.

  {"id":"plana_randomized_2022","abstract":"Despite the potential of machine learning to improve multiple aspects of patient care, barriers to clinical adoption remain. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are often a prerequisite to large-scale clinical adoption of an intervention, and important questions remain regarding how machine learning interventions are being incorporated into clinical trials in health care.To systematically examine the design, reporting standards, risk of bias, and inclusivity of RCTs for medical machine learning interventions.In this systematic review, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection online databases were searched and citation chasing was done to find relevant articles published from the inception of each database to October 15, 2021. Search terms for machine learning, clinical decision-making, and RCTs were used. Exclusion criteria included implementation of a non-RCT design, absence of original data, and evaluation of nonclinical interventions. Data were extracted from published articles. Trial characteristics, including primary intervention, demographics, adherence to the CONSORT-AI reporting guideline, and Cochrane risk of bias were analyzed.Literature search yielded 19‚ÄØ737 articles, of which 41 RCTs involved a median of 294 participants (range, 17-2488 participants). A total of 16 RCTS (39%) were published in 2021, 21 (51%) were conducted at single sites, and 15 (37%) involved endoscopy. No trials adhered to all CONSORT-AI standards. Common reasons for nonadherence were not assessing poor-quality or unavailable input data (38 trials [93%]), not analyzing performance errors (38 [93%]), and not including a statement regarding code or algorithm availability (37 [90%]). Overall risk of bias was high in 7 trials (17%). Of 11 trials (27%) that reported race and ethnicity data, the median proportion of participants from underrepresented minority groups was 21% (range, 0%-51%).This systematic review found that despite the large number of medical machine learning‚Äìbased algorithms in development, few RCTs for these technologies have been conducted. Among published RCTs, there was high variability in adherence to reporting standards and risk of bias and a lack of participants from underrepresented minority groups. These findings merit attention and should be considered in future RCT design and reporting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Plana","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Shung","given":"Dennis L."},{"family":"Grimshaw","given":"Alyssa A."},{"family":"Saraf","given":"Anurag"},{"family":"Sung","given":"Joseph J.

  {"id":"planchard_egfrindependent_2015","abstract":"Abstract Background AZD9291 is an oral, irreversible, mutant-selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), which specifically targets both sensitizing and resistant T790M mutations. This compound has shown outstanding activity, in a phase I/II (AURA) trial. However, despite impressive tumor responses in T790M-positive patients, acquired resistance to this drug limits the benefit of this compound. Mutations at the EGFR C797 codon, located within the kinase-binding site, were very recently reported to be a potential mechanism of resistance to AZD9291 in T790M-positive patients. Patients and methods To identify potential mechanisms of resistance to AZD9291, we report here on two patients with resistant biopsy specimens that had been treated with AZD9291. Results We identified in two distinct cases, HER2 and MET amplification by FISH and CGH as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKI. Interestingly, this event occurred with complete loss of the T790M mutation. In one case, we observed a different molecular status at two biopsy sites (the T790M mutation at the primary site and wild-type T790M at the metastatic site with different pathways of acquired resistance to AZD9291). Conclusion Our observations suggest that T790M-positive and wild-type T790M clones may coexist at baseline. AZD9291 efficiently suppresses the growth of T790M-positive cells, but a population of wild-type T790M cells at baseline will mediate the development of resistance, here via a by-pass pathway activating either HER2 or MET.","author":[{"family":"Planchard","given":"David"},{"family":"Loriot","given":"Yohann"},{"family":"Andre","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Gobert","given":"A."},{"family":"Auger","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Lacroix","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Soria","given":"J-C."}],"citation-key":"planchard_egfrindependent_2015","container-title":"Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology","container-title-short":"Ann.

These IWG 2006 criteria have been used prospectively in many clinical trials in MDSs, but proved challenging in several of them, especially for the evaluation of erythroid response. In this report, we provide rationale for modifications (IWG 2018) of these recommendations, mainly for \"hematological improvement\" criteria used for lower-risk MDSs, based on recent practical and reported experience in clinical trials. Most suggestions relate to erythroid response assessment, which are refined in an overall more stringent manner.

  {"id":"platzbecker_s165_2023","abstract":"Background: Unmet need remains for novel therapies after failure of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent (TD) lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS). In IMerge Phase 2 (NCT02598661), treatment with imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor, resulted in prolonged, durable transfusion independence (TI) across a broad range of heavily RBC TD ESA relapsed/refractory non-del(5q) LR-MDS patients (pts) naive to lenalidomide and hypomethylating agents (len/HMA). Aims: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of imetelstat vs placebo in this pt population in IMerge Phase 3. Methods: Heavily RBC TD ESA relapsed/refractory/ineligible (R/R) non-del(5q) LR-MDS pts naive to len/HMA were randomized 2:1 to receive imetelstat 7.5 mg/kg (N=118) or placebo (N=60) every 4 wks. The primary endpoint was 8-wk TI rate; subgroup analyses included IPSS risk, prior transfusion burden, and ring sideroblasts (RS) status. Secondary endpoints included 24-wk TI rate, TI duration, and hematologic improvement-erythroid (HI-E) rate. Change in mutation burden (variant allele frequency [VAF]) was exploratory. The primary analysis cutoff was Oct 2022; cutoff for ‚â•1-yr TI was Jan 2023. The primary and key secondary endpoints were compared using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by prior transfusion burden and IPSS category. TI duration was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by stratified log-rank test. Results: The primary endpoint was met; 47 pts (39.8%) vs 9 pts (15.0%) receiving imetelstat vs placebo achieved 8-wk TI, P < 0.001. The rate of 8-wk TI was also significantly higher with imetelstat vs placebo across subgroups, including in RS negative pts. Median TI duration (95% CI) was 51.6 (26.9‚Äì83.9) wks with imetelstat vs 13.3 (8.0‚Äì24.9) wks with placebo, P < 0.001. Twenty-four-wk TI was achieved in 33 pts (28.0%) vs 2 pts (3.3%) receiving imetelstat vs placebo, P < 0.001. With 3 months‚Äô additional follow-up, 21 pts (17.8%) on imetelstat vs 1 pt (1.7%) on placebo achieved ‚â•1-yr TI, P = 0.002, representing 63.6% of ‚â•24-wk TI imetelstat responders (Figure). HI-E rates (2018 IWG, emphasizing >16-wk response) were 42.4% with imetelstat vs 13.3% with placebo, P < 0.001. Pts receiving imetelstat had significantly higher mean hemoglobin (P < 0.001) and fewer transfusions (P = 0.042) over time than those on placebo. VAF reduction in 3 genes frequently mutated in MDS was significantly greater in pts treated with imetelstat than placebo: SF3B1 (P < 0.001), TET2 (P = 0.032), DNMT3A (P = 0.019) and ASXL1 (P = NS). SF3B1 VAF reduction correlated with longer TI duration in imetelstat-treated pts, P < 0.001. No new safety signals were identified in IMerge P3. The most common Grade 3/4 AEs with imetelstat were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia; similar rates of Grade ‚â•3 bleeding and infections were observed on imetelstat and placebo. Cytopenias with imetelstat were of short duration, and >80% resolved to Grade ‚â§2 within 4 wks. Summary/Conclusion: Imetelstat demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy with robust 8-wk, 24-wk, and 1-yr TI rates and durable continuous TI. For this LR-MDS patient population, almost one fifth of imetelstat-treated pts achieved continuous TI for ‚â•1 yr, representing substantial relief from transfusion-associated complications. VAF reduction and its correlation to clinical endpoints, including durable TI, support imetelstat‚Äôs disease-modifying potential. Safety results were consistent with prior reports. Imetelstat treatment provides significant clinical benefit to a heavily TD LR MDS pt population in need of novel therapy.Keywords: Therapy, Clinical trial, Myelodysplastic syndrome, Telomerase activity","author":[{"family":"Platzbecker","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Santini","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Fenaux","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Sekeres","given":"Mikkael"},{"family":"Savona","given":"Michael Robert"},{"family":"Madanat","given":"Yazan"},{"family":"D√≠ez","given":"Campelo Mar√≠a"},{"family":"Valc√°rcel","given":"David"},{"family":"Illmer","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Jon√°≈°ov√°","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Belohlavkova","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Sherman","given":"Laurie"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Tymara"},{"family":"Dougherty","given":"Souria"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Sheetal"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Lixian"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Libo"},{"family":"Wan","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Ikin","given":"Annat"},{"family":"Navada","given":"Shyamala"},{"family":"Komrokji","given":"Rami S."},{"family":"Zeidan","given":"Amer M."}],"citation-key":"platzbecker_s165_2023","container-title":"HemaSphere","DOI":"10.1097/01.hs9.0000967572.05685.92","issue":"S3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"e0568592-e0568592","title":"S165: CONTINUOUS TRANFUSION INDEPENDENCE WITH IMETELSTAT IN HEAVILY TRANSFUSED NON-DEL(5Q) LOWER-RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES RELAPSED/REFRACTORY TO ERYTHROPOIESIS STIMULATING AGENTS IN IMERGE PHASE 3","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Six population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) questions were generated. Critical outcomes were prediction of fluid responsiveness, reductions in organ failures or complications and mortality. Forest plots were generated for summary data and GRADE methodology was used to assess for quality of the evidence. Reviews are registered in PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (42015032402 and 42015032530).\nRESULTS: Twelve focused ultrasound studies and 20 APWA investigations met inclusion criteria. The appropriateness of focused ultrasound or APWA-based protocols to predict fluid responsiveness varied widely by study groups. Results were mixed in the one focused ultrasound study and 9 APWA studies addressing reductions in organ failures or complications. There was no mortality advantage of either modality versus standard care. Quality of the evidence was considered very low to low across all PICO questions.\nCONCLUSION:","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Plurad","given":"David S."},{"family":"Chiu","given":"William"},{"family":"Raja","given":"Ali S."},{"family":"Galvagno","given":"Samuel M."},{"family":"Khan","given":"Uzer"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dennis Y."},{"family":"Tisherman","given":"Samuel A."},{"family":"Ward","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Hamill","given":"Mark E."},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Vicki"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Bryce"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"plurad_monitoring_2018","container-title":"Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery","container-title-short":"J Trauma Acute Care Surg","DOI":"10.1097/TA.0000000000001719","ISSN":"2163-0763, 2163-0755","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"language":"en","page":"37-49","source":"3.697","title":"Monitoring modalities and assessment of fluid status: A practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma","title-short":"Monitoring modalities and assessment of fluid status","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/01586154-201801000-00006","volume":"84"},
  {"id":"poletto_treatment_2022","abstract":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is nowadays a curable disease with the frontline treatment R-CHOP, but 30-40% of patients are still unresponsive or relapse thereafter. In the recent era several upcoming new options are improving the therapeutic landscape for relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL setting, first of all anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) that already represent a standard of care as third-line therapy and are rapidly moving as second-line treatment for those who are refractory or early relapse after R-CHOP. Among these new therapies, the combinations polatuzumab plus rituximab and bendamustine, tafasitamab plus lenalidomide for transplant ineligible patients, and CD3xCD20 bispecific antibodies are the most relevant, but several other agents and strategies are on the way. On the other hand, in the last 20¬†years, several efforts have been spent in the attempt to ameliorate the outcome over R-CHOP for the frontline treatment of DLBCL shortening the interval between the cycles or intensifying treatment or adding novel drugs to R-CHOP without success, so far. Recent studies combining the anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab vedotin plus R-CHP and the anti-BCL2 agent venetoclax plus R-CHOP showed promising results. Preliminary data of new upcoming strategies characterized by a tailored therapy based on different molecular subtypes of DLBCL are encouraging, showing a benefit over the standard R-CHOP. In this manuscript, the literature data on the landscape of new therapies available and upcoming for both frontline and R/R settings of DLBCL will be critically reviewed.","author":[{"family":"Poletto","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Novo","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Paruzzo","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Frascione","given":"Pio Manlio Mirko"},{"family":"Vitolo","given":"Umberto"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"poletto_treatment_2022","container-title":"Cancer Treatment Reviews","container-title-short":"Cancer Treat Rev","DOI":"10.1016/j.ctrv.2022.102443","ISSN":"1532-1967","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"eng","page":"102443","PMID":"35933930","source":"13.608","title":"Treatment strategies for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"110"},

  {"id":"porter_grading_2018","abstract":"Anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy has demonstrated high response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B cell malignancies but is associated with significant toxicity. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most significant complication associated with CAR T cell therapy, and it is critical to have a reproducible and easy method to grade CRS after CAR T cell infusions. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale is inadequate for grading CRS associated with cellular therapy. Clinical experience with the anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy tisagenlecleucel at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) was used to develop the Penn grading scale for CRS. The Penn grading scale depends on easily accessible clinical features; does not rely on location of care or quantitation of supportive care; assigns grades to guide CRS management; distinguishes between mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening CRS; and applies to both early-onset and delayed-onset CRS associated with T cell therapies. Clinical data from 55 pediatric patients with r/r B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 42 patients with r/r chronic lymphocytic lymphoma treated with tisagenlecleucel were used to demonstrate the current application of the Penn grading scale. We show that the Penn grading scale provides reproducible CRS grading that can be useful to guide therapy and that can be applied across clinical trials and treatment platforms.","author":[{"family":"Porter","given":"David L."},{"family":"Frey","given":"Noelle V."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Weng","given":"Yanqiu"},{"family":"Grupp","given":"Stephan A."}],"citation-key":"porter_grading_2018","container-title":"Journal of Hematology and Oncology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"poulikakos_molecular_2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            With the identification of activating mutations in BRAF across a wide variety of malignancies, substantial effort was placed in designing safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target BRAF. These efforts have led to the development and regulatory approval of three BRAF inhibitors as well as five combinations of a BRAF inhibitor plus an additional agent(s) to manage cancer such as melanoma, non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer. To date, each regimen is effective only in patients with tumors harboring BRAFV600 mutations and the duration of benefit is often short-lived. Further limitations preventing optimal management of BRAF-mutant malignancies are that treatments of non-V600 BRAF mutations have been less profound and combination therapy is likely necessary to overcome resistance mechanisms, but multi-drug regimens are often too toxic. With the emergence of a deeper understanding of how BRAF mutations signal through the RAS/MAPK pathway, newer RAF inhibitors are being developed that may be more effective and potentially safer and more rational combination therapies are being tested in the clinic. In this review, we identify the mechanics of RAF signaling through the RAS/MAPK pathway, present existing data on single-agent and combination RAF targeting efforts, describe emerging combinations, summarize the toxicity of the various agents in clinical testing, and speculate as to where the field may be headed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Poulikakos","given":"Poulikos I."},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Yaeger","given":"Rona"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"poulikakos_molecular_2022","container-title":"Clinical Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin.

The possibility that ALK proteins are immunogenic was investigated with the use of an immunocytochemical technique to screen plasma from ALK-positive ALCL on transfectants expressing ALK proteins and by an in vitro kinase assay. Circulating antibodies against NPM-ALK protein were present in all ALK-positive ALCL patients (11 out of 11 cases) studied while 10 patients also had antibodies recognizing normal ALK protein. Weak antibodies reactive with NPM-ALK (which may represent anti-NPM autoantibodies) were detected by the in vitro kinase assay in 3 of the 10 control samples (but not by immunocytochemistry). The presence of anti-ALK antibodies may be relevant to the relatively good prognosis of ALK-positive ALCL. The immunocytochemical technique for detecting anti-ALK activity is simple and semiquantative and may provide a means of detecting B-cell responses to other tumor-associated molecules.

  {"id":"punzon-jimenez_molecular_2022","abstract":"High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) represents the most common form of epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The absence of specific symptoms leads to late-stage diagnosis, making HGSOC one of the gynecological cancers with the worst prognosis. The cellular origin of HGSOC and the role of reproductive hormones, genetic traits (such as alterations in P53 and DNA-repair mechanisms), chromosomal instability, or dysregulation of crucial signaling pathways have been considered when evaluating prognosis and response to therapy in HGSOC patients. However, the detection of HGSOC is still based on traditional methods such as carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) detection and ultrasound, and the combined use of these methods has yet to support significant reductions in overall mortality rates. The current paradigm for HGSOC management has moved towards early diagnosis via the non-invasive detection of molecular markers through liquid biopsies. This review presents an integrated view of the relevant cellular and molecular aspects involved in the etiopathogenesis of HGSOC and brings together studies that consider new horizons for the possible early detection of this gynecological cancer.","author":[{"family":"Punz√≥n-Jim√©nez","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Lago","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Domingo","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Sim√≥n","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Mas","given":"Aymara"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"punzon-jimenez_molecular_2022","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"Int J Mol Sci","DOI":"10.3390/ijms232213777","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,9]]},"language":"en","page":"13777","PMCID":"PMC9692799","PMID":"36430255","source":"6.208","title":"Molecular Management of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

To our knowledge, the TAILOR trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01228734) is the first randomized, multicenter, phase III study of the addition of cetuximab to first-line FOLFOX prospectively choosing a RAS wt population and thus providing confirmative data for the efficacy and safety of cetuximab plus FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: TAILOR is an open-label, randomized (1:1), multicenter, phase III trial in patients from China comparing FOLFOX-4 with or without cetuximab in RAS wt (KRAS/NRAS, exons 2 to 4) mCRC. The primary end point of TAILOR was progression-free survival time; secondary end points included overall survival time, overall response rate, and safety and tolerability.\nRESULTS: In the modified intent-to-treat population of 393 patients with RAS wt mCRC, adding cetuximab to FOLFOX-4 significantly improved the primary end point of progression-free survival time compared with FOLFOX-4 alone (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.89; P = .004; median, 9.2 v 7.4 months, respectively), as well as the secondary end points of overall survival time (current assessment after 300 events: hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.96; P = .02; median, 20.7 v 17.8 months, respectively) and overall response rate (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.61 to 3.61; P < .001; 61.1% v 39.5%, respectively).

Here, we conducted a phase II clinical trial testing efficacy and toxicities of CAR-T therapy in R/R non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (NCT03196830). Among enrolled patients, 33 R/R DLBCL patients pretreated with DFC (decitabine, fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide) lymphodepletion chemotherapy and infused with tandem CD19-CD22 based CAR-T cells were drawn out for efficacy and toxicities of CAR-T therapy evaluation. With a median follow-up of 10.9(0.6-29.0) months, the best overall response and complete remission (CR) rates were 90.9% and 63.6%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.2 months and overall survival (OS) was undefined. The 2-year OS and PFS rates were 54.3% and 47.2%, respectively. No severe grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed and grade 3 CRS was observed in only 7 patients; 3 patients developed mild immune effect or cell-associated neurotoxic syndrome. All toxicities were transient and reversible and no CAR-T-related mortality. Further subgroup analysis showed that achieving CR was an independent prognostic factor associated with favorable PFS and OS. The 2-year OS and PFS for patients who achieved CR within 3 months (undefined versus undefined P=0.021 and undefined versus undefined P=0.036) or during the follow-up period were significantly longer than those who did not (undefined versus 4.6 months P < 0.0001 and undefined versus 2.0months P<0.001). While severe CRS was also an independent prognostic factor but associated with inferior PFS and OS. The 2-year OS and PFS for patients with grade 3 CRS were significantly shorter than those with grade 0-2 CRS (4.1 months versus undefined P<0.0001 and 1.7 months versus undefined P=0.0002).

More than 40‚Äâyears later, even in the era of precision medicine and immunotherapy, Pt drugs remain among the most widely used anticancer drugs. As Pt drugs mainly target DNA, it is not surprising that recent insights into alterations of DNA repair mechanisms provide a useful explanation for their success. Many cancers have defective DNA repair, a feature that also sheds new light on the mechanisms of secondary drug resistance, such as the restoration of DNA repair pathways. In addition, genome-wide functional screening approaches have revealed interesting insights into Pt drug uptake. About half of cisplatin and carboplatin but not oxaliplatin may enter cells through the widely expressed volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). The analysis of this heteromeric channel in tumour biopsies may therefore be a useful biomarker to stratify patients for initial Pt treatments. Moreover, Pt-based approaches may be improved in the future by the optimization of combinations with immunotherapy, management of side effects and use of nanodelivery devices. Hence, Pt drugs may still be part of the standard of care for several cancers in the coming years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"R","given":"ottenberg Sven"},{"family":"D","given":"isler Carmen"},{"family":"P","given":"erego Paola"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"r_rediscovery_2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Cancer","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Cancer","DOI":"10.1038/s41568-020-00308-y","ISSN":"1474-1768","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 Springer Nature Limited","number":"1","page":"37-50","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"78.5","title":"The rediscovery of platinum-based cancer therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-020-00308-y","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"r_scalable_2018","abstract":"Predictive modeling with electronic health record (EHR) data is anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient‚Äôs record. We propose a representation of patients‚Äô entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24‚Äâh. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting: in-hospital mortality (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC] across sites 0.93‚Äì0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75‚Äì0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85‚Äì0.86), and all of a patient‚Äôs final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in all cases.

  {"id":"radford_improving_","abstract":"Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classiÔ¨Åcation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciÔ¨Åc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative Ô¨Åne-tuning on each speciÔ¨Åc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during Ô¨Åne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture.

  {"id":"raje_monitoring_2023","abstract":"Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are emerging as an important novel class of immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), and are set to be more widely used in clinical practice. However, this new class of therapies is associated with a distinct adverse event (AE) profile that includes cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, as well as AEs leading to increased infection risk such as cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections themselves. As preliminary data with this class of agents shows an increased risk of infections as compared with conventional MM treatment regimens, such as immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), guidance on infection monitoring, prophylaxis and treatment is required. This review provides consensus recommendations from a panel of 13 global experts, following a meeting in August 2022. The meeting objective was to review existing literature and identify relevant information on infections with all BsAbs in patients with MM, as well as to discuss clinical experience of experts in managing these infections. The recommendations outlined here can be used to guide management of infection risk factors, such as hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia. In addition, they can be used to guide the monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of bacterial, viral and fungal infections, including emerging infections of interest, such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the use of vaccinations prior to and during BsAb treatment. The recommendations have been graded by the panel based on level of data available. Key recommendations include universal herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus prophylaxis, screening for hepatitis B virus reactivation risk in all patients, monthly intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for immunoparesis and in the absence of life-threatening infectious manifestations, use of colony-stimulating factors in patients with Grade 3 neutropenia, universal pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis and no routine anti-fungal prophylaxis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Raje","given":"Noopur"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Einsele","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Efebera","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Gay","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Hammond","given":"Sarah P."},{"family":"Lesokhin","given":"Alexander M."},{"family":"Lonial","given":"Sagar"},{"family":"Ludwig","given":"Heinz"},{"family":"Moreau","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Krina"},{"family":"Ramasamy","given":"Karthik"},{"family":"Mateos","given":"Maria-Victoria"}],"citation-key":"raje_monitoring_2023","container-title":"Blood Cancer Journal","container-title-short":"Blood Cancer J.","DOI":"10.1038/s41408-023-00879-7","ISSN":"2044-5385","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,1]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","page":"1-17","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy: consensus recommendations from an expert panel","title-short":"Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-023-00879-7","volume":"13"},

These changes are based on the identification of biomarkers associated with near inevitable development of CRAB features in patients who would otherwise be regarded as having smouldering multiple myeloma. A delay in application of the label of multiple myeloma and postponement of therapy could be detrimental to these patients. In addition to this change, we clarify and update the underlying laboratory and radiographic variables that fulfil the criteria for the presence of myeloma-defining CRAB features, and the histological and monoclonal protein requirements for the disease diagnosis. Finally, we provide specific metrics that new biomarkers should meet for inclusion in the disease definition. The International Myeloma Working Group recommends the implementation of these criteria in routine practice and in future clinical trials, and recommends that future studies analyse any differences in outcome that might occur as a result of the new disease definition.","author":[{"family":"Rajkumar","given":"S.

  {"id":"ramesh_irinotecan_2010","abstract":"The introduction of irinotecan has revolutionized the applicability of camptothecins as predominant topoisomerase I inhibitor for anti-cancer therapy. The potent anti-tumor activity of irinotecan is due to rapid formation of an in vivo active metabolite, SN-38. Therefore, irinotecan is considered as a pro-drug to generate SN-38. Over the past decade, side-by-side with the clinical advancement of the use of irinotecan in the oncology field, a plethora of bioanalytical methods have been published to quantify irinotecan, SN-38 and other metabolites. Because of the availability of HPLC, LC-MS and LC-MS/MS methods, the pharmacokinetic profiling of irinotecan and its metabolites has been accomplished in multiple species, including cancer patients. The developed assays continue to find use in the optimization of newly designed delivery systems with regard to pharmacokinetics to promote safe and effective use of either irinotecan or SN-38. This review intends to: firstly, provide an exhaustive compilation of the published assays for irinotecan, SN-38 and other metabolite(s) of irinotecan, as applicable; secondly, to enumerate the validation parameters and applicable conclusions; and thirdly, provide some recent perspectives in the clinical pharmacology arena pertaining to efflux transporters, pediatric profiling, role of kidney function in defining toxicity, drug‚Äìdrug interaction potential of irinotecan, etc. Copyright ¬© 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramesh","given":"Mullangi"},{"family":"Ahlawat","given":"Preeti"},{"family":"Srinivas","given":"Nuggehally R."}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"ramesh_irinotecan_2010","container-title":"Biomedical Chromatography","container-title-short":"Biomed.

  {"id":"rampal_pelabresib_2023","abstract":"BackgroundMyelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, anemia, splenomegaly and MF-associated symptoms. These hallmarks result from dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway and BET-mediated MF target gene modulation. Pelabresib (CPI-0610; pela) is an investigational oral small-molecule drug designed to inhibit BET-mediated gene transcription involved in MF pathogenesis. Preclinical data support the potential of combining pela with therapiesthat target overlapping pathways, such as JAK/STAT, to improve response by inhibiting the molecular drivers of MF. The Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 trial was initiated based on compelling data from Arm 3 of the ongoing Phase 2 MANIFEST study (NCT02158858), which is evaluating the combination of pela and ruxolitinib (rux) in JAK inhibitor (JAKi) treatment-na√Øve patients (pts) with MF. In Arm 3 of MANIFEST, primary endpoint analyses at 24 Weeks (Wks) for the 84 pts enrolled reported SVR35 (‚â•35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline) in 68% of pts and TSS50 (‚â•50% reduction in Total Symptom Score [TSS] from baseline) in 56% of pts (Mascarenhas, et al. 2023).AimsMANIFEST-2 (NCT04603495) is a global, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-control study of pela + rux versus placebo + rux in JAKi treatment-na√Øve pts with primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pela + rux. Here we present the study design and baseline patient stratification for MANIFEST-2. Results from the primary analysis of MANIFEST-2 will be presented at the ASH Annual Meeting 2023.MethodsThe MANIFEST-2 study schema is shown in Figure 1. Key eligibility criteria include a DIPSS score of Intermediate-1 (Int-1) or higher, platelet count ‚â•100 √ó 10 9/L, spleen volume ‚â•450 cm 3 by CT or MRI, ‚â•2 symptoms with an average score ‚â•3 or a TSS of ‚â•10 using the MFSAF v4.0, peripheral blast count &lt;5% and an ECOG performance status ‚â§2. Patient randomization was stratified by DIPSS risk category (Int-1 vs Int-2 vs High), platelet count (&gt;200 √ó 10 9/L vs 100-200 √ó 10 9/L) and spleen volume (‚â•1800 cm 3 vs &lt;1800 cm 3). Double-blind treatment of pela (125-175 mg) or placebo was administered once daily for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day break, which is considered one cycle of treatment. Rux (5-25 mg) was administered twice daily based on platelet counts and spleen response for all 21 days of the cycle. The primary endpoint is SVR35 response at Wk 24. Secondary endpoints include TSS50, percentage change in TSS, safety, pharmacokinetics, changes in bone marrow fibrosis, progression-free survival, overall survival, conversion from transfusion dependence to independence and rate of red blood cell transfusion for the first 24 wks.ResultsA total of 591 pts were screened at 138 sites. Following the screening process, 431 pts from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia were randomized. The number of pts assigned to each randomization stratum are presented in Table 1; the majority of pts presented with DIPSS Int-1 or -2, had a platelet count above 200 √ó 10 9/L and spleen volume below 1800 cm 3. The study opened for enrolment in November 2020; the first patient received their initial treatment on April 22, 2021, and the last patient received their first treatment on March 2, 2023. The last patient is expected to reach the 24-wk primary endpoint on August 31, 2023, following which a primary analysis will occur. As of June 27, 2023 there were 383 pts ongoing in the study.ConclusionThe Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 study was initiated based on compelling data from the ongoing Phase 2 MANIFEST study, in which the combination of pela and rux in Arm 3 demonstrated significant clinical activity and disease-modifying potential without clinically relevant treatment-limiting toxicity. MANIFEST-2 has completed recruitment and will provide definitive efficacy results of combination therapy in JAKi treatment-na√Øve pts with MF. As DIPSS Int-1 pts have been excluded or underrepresented in prior randomized trials in MF, MANIFEST-2 will also provide important insights in assessing the benefits of starting treatment at an earlier stage of the disease. Primary results from the pivotal Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 trial of pela and rux versus placebo and rux in JAKi treatment-na√Øve pts may have the potential to influence the MF treatment paradigm and will be presented at the ASH Annual Meeting 2023.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Rampal","given":"Raajit K."},{"family":"Grosicki","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Chraniuk","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Abruzzese","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Bose","given":"Prithviraj"},{"family":"Gerds","given":"Aaron T."},{"family":"Vannucchi","given":"Alessandro M."},{"family":"Palandri","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sung-Eun"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Vikas"},{"family":"Lucchesi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Oh","given":"Stephen T."},{"family":"Kuykendall","given":"Andrew T."},{"family":"Patriarca","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Alvarez-Larran","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Mesa","given":"Ruben"},{"family":"Kiladjian","given":"Jean-Jacques"},{"family":"Talpaz","given":"Moshe"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Morgan"},{"family":"Kays","given":"Sarah-Katharina"},{"family":"Jegg","given":"Anna-Maria"},{"family":"Li","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Claire N"},{"family":"Mascarenhas","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"rampal_pelabresib_2023","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-179141","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"Supplement 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"page":"628","source":"Silverchair","title":"Pelabresib in Combination with Ruxolitinib for Janus Kinase Inhibitor Treatment-Na√Øve Patients with Myelofibrosis: Results of the MANIFEST-2 Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase 3 Study","title-short":"Pelabresib in Combination with Ruxolitinib for Janus Kinase Inhibitor Treatment-Na√Øve Patients with Myelofibrosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2023-179141","volume":"142"},

The focus of this study was to design, introduce, and evaluate the integration of a wholebody point-of-care (POC) ultrasound curriculum (Focused periOperative Risk Evaluation Sonography Involving Gastroabdominal Hemodynamic and Transthoracic ultrasound) into residency training.\nMethods: For 2 yr, anesthesiology residents (n = 42) received lectures using a model/simulation design and half were also randomly assigned to receive pathology assessment training. Posttraining performance was assessed through Kirkpatrick levels 1 to 4 outcomes based on the resident satisfaction surveys, multiple-choice tests, pathologic image evaluation, human model testing, and assessment of clinical impact via review of clinical examination data.\nResults: Evaluation of the curriculum demonstrated high satisfaction scores (n = 30), improved content test scores (n = 37) for all tested categories (48‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ16 to 69‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ17%, P < 0.002), and improvement on human model examinations.

  {"id":"rashid_dabigatran_2019","abstract":"Background The American College of Chest Physicians and American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association recommend using low-molecular-weight heparin for 28 days postoperatively for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after cancer surgery. Dabigatran is a once daily oral anticoagulant that is FDA approved for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after orthopedic surgery, uses fixed dosing, and has an antidote.\nMethods Patients undergoing surgery for malignant pancreatic tumors (neuroendocrine excluded) from January 2017 to January 2018 were converted to dabigatran 220 mg daily on discharge until postoperative day 28; patients with medical or insurance contraindications were converted to enoxaparin or another direct oral anticoagulant. The primary endpoint was bleeding complications through 90 days.\nResults A total of 134 patients were considered for this study (median age 67 ¬± 10; 58.9% male). Eighty-seven (82.9%) patients received dabigatran and 18 (17.1%) received another form of anticoagulation. There were 19 (4.2%) patients not prescribed dabigatran due to medical or inpatient contraindications. Four patients experienced bleeding complications after discharge while on dabigatran. Two (2%) were major bleeds (Clavien-Dindo IV and V), and 2 (2%) were minor (Clavien-Dindo I). Patient compliance was excellent, with 93% of prescribed patients fully completing their prophylaxis. There were 2 patients that developed symptomatic deep vein thrombosis.\nConclusion The use of a direct oral anticoagulant as extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after major gastrointestinal surgery has not been studied to date. These results show dabigatran to be a safe alternative to low-molecular-weight heparin for extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with regard to bleeding complications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Rashid","given":"M.

Patients in complete remission (CR) continued maintenance dasatinib, vincristine, and prednisone for 2 years, which was followed by dasatinib indefinitely. Patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) received it during their first CR.\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-two patients with a median age of 55 years (range, 21-80 years) were treated; 69 (96%) achieved CR. Among them, 57 (83%) achieved cytogenetic CR after 1 cycle, and 64 (93%) achieved a major molecular response at a median of 4 weeks (range, 2-38 weeks). Sixty-five patients (94%) were negative for minimal residual disease assessed by flow cytometry at a median of 3 weeks (range, 2-37 weeks). Dasatinib-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events included bleeding, pleural/pericardial effusions, and elevated transaminases. With a median follow-up of 67 months (range, 33-97 months), 33 patients (46%) were alive, and 30 (43%) were in CR; 12 underwent allogeneic SCT. Thirty-nine patients died (3 at induction, 19 after relapse, 7 after SCT performed during first CR, and 10 during CR).

Differences in protein interactions and activated signaling pathways that may be associated with the different diseases driven by p210 and p190 are unknown. We have performed a quantitative comparative proteomics study of p210 and p190. Strong differences in the interactome and tyrosine phosphoproteome were found and validated. Whereas the AP2 adaptor complex that regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis interacts preferentially with p190, the phosphatase Sts1 is enriched with p210. Stronger activation of the Stat5 transcription factor and the Erk1/2 kinases is observed with p210, whereas Lyn kinase is activated by p190.

  {"id":"recondo_diverse_2019","abstract":"Purpose: Lorlatinib is a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor with proven efficacy in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer previously treated with first- and second-generation ALK inhibitors. Beside compound mutations in the ALK kinase domain, other resistance mechanisms driving lorlatinib resistance remain unknown. We aimed to characterize the mechanisms of resistance to lorlatinib occurring in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer and design new therapeutic strategies in this setting. Experimental Design: Resistance mechanisms were investigated in 5 patients resistant to lorlatinib. Longitudinal tumor biopsies were studied using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Patient-derived models were developed to characterize the acquired resistance mechanisms, and Ba/F3 cell mutants were generated to study the effect of novel ALK compound mutations. Drug combinatory strategies were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to overcome lorlatinib resistance. Results: Diverse biological mechanisms leading to lorlatinib resistance were identified. EpithelialÔøΩ¢ò´esenchymal transition (EMT) mediated resistance in two patient-derived cell lines and was susceptible to dual SRC and ALK inhibition. We characterized three ALK kinase domain compound mutations occurring in patients, L1196M/D1203N, F1174L/G1202R, and C1156Y/G1269A, with differential susceptibility to ALK inhibition by lorlatinib. We identified a novel bypass mechanism of resistance caused by NF2 loss-of-function mutations, conferring sensitivity to treatment with mTOR inhibitors. Conclusions: This study shows that mechanisms of resistance to lorlatinib are diverse and complex, requiring new therapeutic strategies to tailor treatment upon disease progression.","author":[{"family":"Recondo","given":"Gonzalo"},{"family":"Mezquita","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Facchinetti","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Planchard","given":"David"},{"family":"Gazzah","given":"Anas"},{"family":"Bigot","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Rizvi","given":"Ahsan Z."},{"family":"Frias","given":"Rosa L."},{"family":"Thiery","given":"Jean Paul"},{"family":"Scoazec","given":"Jean-Yves"},{"family":"Sourisseau","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Howarth","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Deas","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Samofalova","given":"D.

  {"id":"reuss_trust_2019","abstract":"Background Primary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy has been considered standard management for patients with advanced ovarian cancer over decades. An alternative approach of interval debulking surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy was subsequently reported by two randomized phase III trials (EORTC‚ÄêGCG, CHORUS), which were criticized owing to important limitations, especially regarding the rate of complete resection.\nPrimary Objective To clarify the optimal timing of surgical therapy in advanced ovarian cancer.\nStudy Hypothesis Primary cytoreductive surgery is superior to interval cytoreductive surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for overall survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.\nTrial Design TRUST is an international open, randomized, controlled multi-center trial investigating overall survival after primary cytoreductive surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent interval cytoreductive surgery in patients with FIGO stage IIIB‚ÄìIVB ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma. To guarantee adequate surgical quality, participating centers need to fulfill specific quality assurance criteria (eg, ‚â•50% complete resection rate in upfront surgery for FIGO IIIB‚ÄìIVB patients, ‚â•36 debulking-surgeries/year) and agree to independent audits by TRUST quality committee delegates. Patients in the primary cytoreductive surgery arm undergo surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, whereas patients in the interval cytoreductive surgery arm undergo 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy after histologic confirmation of the disease, followed by interval cytoreductive surgery and subsequently, 3 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. The intention of surgery for both groups is complete tumor resection according to guideline recommendations.\nMajor Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Major inclusion criteria are suspected or histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma, or primary peritoneal carcinoma FIGO stage IIIB‚ÄìIVB (IV only if resectable metastasis). Major exclusion criteria are non-epithelial ovarian malignancies and borderline tumors; prior chemotherapy for ovarian cancer; or abdominal/pelvic radiotherapy.\nPrimary Endpoint Overall survival.\nSample Size 772 patients.\nEstimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results Accrual completion approximately mid-2019, results are expected after 5 years' follow-up in 2024.\nTrial Registration NCT02828618.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Reuss","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Bois","given":"Andreas","dropping-particle":"du"},{"family":"Harter","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Fotopoulou","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Sehouli","given":"Jalid"},{"family":"Aletti","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Guyon","given":"Frederic"},{"family":"Greggi","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Mosgaard","given":"Berit Jul"},{"family":"Reinthaller","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Hilpert","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Schade-Brittinger","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Chi","given":"Dennis S."},{"family":"Mahner","given":"Sven"}],"citation-key":"reuss_trust_2019","container-title":"International Journal of Gynecologic Cancer","container-title-short":"Int.

However, accurate data on the incidence of cancer in this population is lacking. In a prospective cohort study, we followed-up with all patients who experienced two unprovoked symptomatic VTE events that occurred in less than 2 years apart. We estimated the 1-year incidence rate of cancer following the second unprovoked VTE event using the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method. Potential predictors for cancer diagnosis were assessed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Between May 2000 and December 2013, we included 197 patients with two episodes of symptomatic unprovoked VTE that occurred in less than 2 years apart. Their mean age was 66.2‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ16.3 years, and 122 (51.8%) were male. Seventeen patients were diagnosed with cancer during the year following the second episode of unprovoked VTE, corresponding to a cumulative incidence rate of 9.19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.81‚Äì14.37). The 1-year cumulative incidence rate of cancer was 35.88% (95% CI: 19.75‚Äì59.25) in patients with VTE recurrence on anticoagulation, 5.51% (95% CI: 2.9‚Äì10.32) among patients with a second episode of unprovoked VTE occurring after stopping anticoagulation and 1.15% (95% CI: 0.16‚Äì7.88) when time elapsed between the first and recurrent VTE was‚Äâ>‚Äâ1 year. Our study suggests that the incidence of cancer in patients with a second episode of unprovoked VTE that occurs off anticoagulation, or‚Äâ>‚Äâ1‚Äâyear after the first event, is similar to that of patients with a first unprovoked VTE event.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"R√©zig","given":"Sh√©h√©razade"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Couturaud","given":"Francis"},{"family":"Lacut","given":"Karine"},{"family":"Delluc","given":"Aur√©lien"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"rezig_incidence_2019","container-title":"Thrombosis and Haemostasis","container-title-short":"Thromb Haemost","DOI":"10.1055/s-0039-1677745","ISSN":"0340-6245, 2567-689X","issue":"03","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"language":"en","page":"490-495","source":"6.681","title":"Incidence of Cancer after a Second Unprovoked Venous Thromboembolic Event","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0039-1677745","volume":"119"},
  {"id":"rheinheimer_oligoprogressive_2020","abstract":"Oligoprogression (OPD) of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) occurs in approximately half of patients under targeted compounds (TKI) and facilitates use of regional therapies that can prolong survival. In order to characterize OPD in immunotherapy (IO)-treated NSCLC, we analyzed the failure pattern under PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (n = 297) or chemoimmunotherapy (n = 75). Under IO monotherapy, OPD was more frequent (20% vs. 10%, p < 0.05), occurred later (median 11 vs. 5 months, p < 0.01), affected fewer sites (mean 1.1 vs. 1.5, p < 0.05), and involved fewer lesions (1.4 vs. 2.3, p < 0.05) in the first compared to later lines. Lymph nodes (42%, mainly mediastinal) and the brain (39%) were mostly affected, followed by the lung (24%) and other organs. Compared to multifocal progression, OPD occurred later (11 vs. 4 months, p < 0.001) and was associated with longer survival (26 vs. 13 months, p < 0.001) and higher tumor PD-L1 expression (p < 0.001). Chemoimmunotherapy showed a similar incidence of OPD as IO monotherapy (13% vs. 11% at 2 years). Local treatments were applied regularly for brain but only in 50% for extracranial lesions. Thus, NSCLC oligoprogression is less common under IO than under TKI, but also favorable. Since its frequency drops later in the disease, regular restaging and multidisciplinary evaluation are essential in order to exploit the full therapeutic potential.","author":[{"family":"Rheinheimer","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Heussel","given":"Claus Peter"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Gaissmaier","given":"Lena"},{"family":"Bozorgmehr","given":"Farastuk"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Hauke"},{"family":"Herth","given":"Felix J.F."},{"family":"Muley","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Liersch","given":"S."},{"family":"Bischoff","given":"Helge"},{"family":"Kriegsmann","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Shafie","given":"Rami A El"},{"family":"Stenzinger","given":"Albrecht"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kauczor","given":"Hans-Ulrich"},{"family":"Christopoulos","given":"Petros"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"rheinheimer_oligoprogressive_2020","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers12041046","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1046-NA","source":"5.2","title":"Oligoprogressive non-small-cell lung cancer under treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitors","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

The PONALFIL (Ponatinib With Chemotherapy for Young Adults Ph Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) trial combined ponatinib (30 mg/d) with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients aged 18 to 60 years. Ponatinib was only given pre-emptively after alloHSCT. Primary end points were hematologic and molecular response before alloHSCT and event-free survival (EFS), including molecular relapse as event. Thirty patients (median age, 49 years; range, 19-59 years) entered the trial. All exhibited hematologic response, and alloHSCT was performed in 26 patients (20 in complete molecular response and 6 in major molecular response). Only 1 patient died (of graft-versus-host disease), and 5 patients exhibited molecular relapse after alloHSCT. No tyrosine kinase inhibitor was given after HSCT in 18 of 26 patients. Twenty-nine patients are alive (median follow-up, 2.1 years; range, 0.2-4.0 years), with 3-year EFS and overall survival (OS) of 70% (95% confidence interval, 51-89) and 96% (95% confidence interval, 89-100), respectively. Comparison of the PONALFIL and the ALLPh08 (Chemotherapy and Imatinib in Young Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Ph [BCR-ABL] Positive; same schedule, using imatinib as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor) trials by propensity score showed significant improvement in OS for patients in PONALFIL (3-year OS, 96% vs 53%; P = .002). The most frequent grade 3 to 4 adverse events were hematologic (42%), infectious (17%), and hepatic (22%), with only one vascular occlusive event.

  {"id":"riely_frequency_2008","abstract":"PURPOSE: KRAS mutations are found in approximately 25% of lung adenocarcinomas in Western countries and, as a group, have been strongly associated with cigarette smoking. These mutations are predictive of poor prognosis in resected disease as well as resistance to treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined the frequency and type of KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations and characterized their association with cigarette smoking history in patients with lung adenocarcinomas.\nRESULTS: KRAS mutational analysis was done on 482 lung adenocarcinomas, 81 (17%) of which were obtained from patients who had never smoked cigarettes. KRAS mutations were found in 15% (12 of 81; 95% confidence intervals, 8-24%) of tumors from never smokers. Similarly, 22% (69 of 316; 95% confidence intervals, 17-27%) of tumors from former smokers, and 25% (21 of 85; 95% confidence intervals, 16-35%) of tumors from current smokers had KRAS mutations. The frequency of KRAS mutation was not associated with age, gender, or smoking history. The number of pack years of cigarette smoking did not predict an increased likelihood of KRAS mutations. Never smokers were significantly more likely than former or current smokers to have a transition mutation (G-->A) rather than the transversion mutations known to be smoking-related (G-->T or G-->C; P < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on our data, KRAS mutations are not rare among never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma and such patients have a distinct KRAS mutation profile. The etiologic and biological heterogeneity of KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas is worthy of further study.","author":[{"family":"Riely","given":"Gregory J."},{"family":"Kris","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Rosenbaum","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Marks","given":"Jenifer"},{"family":"Li","given":"Allan"},{"family":"Chitale","given":"Dhananjay A."},{"family":"Nafa","given":"Khedoudja"},{"family":"Riedel","given":"Elyn R."},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Meier"},{"family":"Pao","given":"William"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Vincent A."},{"family":"Ladanyi","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"riely_frequency_2008","container-title":"Clinical Cancer Research: An Official Journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin Cancer Res","DOI":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0646","ISSN":"1078-0432","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,15]]},"language":"en","page":"5731-5734","PMCID":"PMC2754127","PMID":"18794081","source":"PubMed","title":"Frequency and distinctive spectrum of KRAS mutations in never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"riessjonathanw._diverse_2018","abstract":"Abstract Introduction EGFR exon 20 insertions (EGFRex20ins) comprise an uncommon subset of EGFR-activating alterations relatively insensitive to first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, recent early clinical data suggests these patients may benefit from newer-generation EGFR-TKIs. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) identifies a broad spectrum of EGFRex20ins and associated co-occurring genomic alterations (GAs) present in NSCLC. Methods Hybrid capture-based CGP was performed prospectively on 14,483 clinically annotated consecutive NSCLC specimens to a mean coverage depth of greater than 650X for 236 or 315 cancer-related genes. Results Of 14,483 NSCLC cases, CGP identified 263 (1.8%) cases with EGFRex20ins, representing 12% (263 of 2251) of cases with EGFR mutations. Sixty-four unique EGFRex20ins were identified, most commonly D770_N771>ASVDN (21%) and N771_P772>SVDNP (20%). EGFR amplification occurred in 22% (57 of 263). The most common co-occurring GAs effected tumor protein p53 (TP53) (56%), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (22%), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B) (16%), NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1) (14%) and RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) (11%); co-occurring GAs in other known lung cancer drivers were rare (5%). Average tumor mutational burden was low (mean 4.3, range 0 to 40.3 mutations/Mb). Clinical outcomes to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs were obtained for five patients and none responded. Conclusions In the largest series of EGFRex20ins NSCLC, diverse EGFRex20ins were detected in 12% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC, a higher frequency than previously reported in smaller single-institution studies. Clinical outcomes showed lack of response to EGFR TKIs. Tumor mutational burden was low, consistent with non‚Äìsmoking associated NSCLC. Comprehensive sequencing revealed increased proportion and wide variety of EGFRex20ins, representing a population of patients significant enough for focused efforts on effective interventions.","author":[{"family":"Riess Jonathan W.","given":""},{"family":"Gandara","given":"David R."},{"family":"Frampton","given":"Garrett M."},{"family":"Madison","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Peled","given":"Nir"},{"family":"Bufill","given":"Jose A."},{"family":"Dy","given":"Grace K."},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Philip J."},{"family":"Mcpherson","given":"John Douglas"},{"family":"Lara","given":"Primo N."},{"family":"Burich","given":"Rebekah A."},{"family":"Ross","given":"Jeffrey S."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Vincent A."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Siraj M."},{"family":"Mack","given":"Philip C."},{"family":"Schrock","given":"Alexa B."}],"citation-key":"riessjonathanw._diverse_2018","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

Of these, 141 were treated prior to the reporting of AOD with chemotherapy (C), immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), or both. This report details the clinical outcomes of these 141 compared to the 384 treated after AOD reported. Methods: Real world data (RWD) were obtained from a curated ICD for pts with NSCLC 4 diagnosed 1/1/2018-12/31/2020 with cutoff of data 3/31/2021. Pts with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, HER2, and NTRK were included if their treatment record were captured. Also included were demographics, ECOG score, date of first report of AOD and dates of initiations of first and any second line of therapy and date of apparent death (AD). Outcome measures were time to next treatment or apparent death (TTNT) and apparent survival (AS) (ICD model does not allow date of death per HIPAA de-identified Expert Determination). Descriptive statistics were used with Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates and Hazard Ratios (HR) by Cox regression. 3 cohorts were defined: Group (Gr) A with 384 pts treated after AOD reported and used as the comparator; the 141 pts treated before AOD with C, ICI or both were divided into Gr B (n = 51) who subsequently switched to TKI within 35 days and Gr C (n = 90) who did not switch. Results: As shown in data table, AS was significantly worse in Gr B and Gr C, TTNT was significantly worse in Gr C and with worsening trend in Gr B. Two potential confounders were identified: higher ECOG scores might indicate more urgency to assign treatment, but pts with ECOG ‚â• 2 were similar in all 3 groups; also, difference in proportion of EGFRm by Group (Gr A 62%, Gr B 57%, and Gr C 29%), but separating cohorts by EGFR mutation status did not alter results. Conclusions: While subject to the limitations of a retrospective observational RWD study, this study strongly suggests outcomes are significantly compromised in pts harboring AOD but who are treated initially with C, ICI or both, even in pts quickly switched to TKI. Since a prospective clinical trial is not ethically feasible, these findings may stimulate review of current guidelines, fuel optimization of universal testing in NSCLC 4, and encourage utilization of liquid or ultra-fast NGS with their rapid turnaround times in order to improve survival in this setting.

A proportion of people with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the Ô¨Årst clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether people with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and non-cancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that people received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier, potentially curative stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and thus lead to improvements in cancer-related mortality and morbidity.

  {"id":"robichauxjacqulynep._mechanisms_2018","abstract":"Although most activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non‚Äìsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are sensitive to available EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a subset with alterations in exon 20 of EGFR and HER2 are intrinsically resistant and lack an effective therapy. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo testing to model structural alterations induced by exon 20 mutations and to identify effective inhibitors. 3D modeling indicated alterations restricted the size of the drug-binding pocket, limiting the binding of large, rigid inhibitors. We found that poziotinib, owing to its small size and flexibility, can circumvent these steric changes and is a potent inhibitor of the most common EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutants. Poziotinib demonstrated greater activity than approved EGFR TKIs in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models of EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutant NSCLC and in genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC. In a phase 2 trial, the first 11 patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations receiving poziotinib had a confirmed objective response rate of 64%. These data identify poziotinib as a potent, clinically active inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutations and illuminate the molecular features of TKIs that may circumvent steric changes induced by these mutations.","author":[{"family":"Robichaux Jacqulyne P.","given":""},{"family":"Elamin","given":"Yasir"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Brett W."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shuxing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shengwu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Poteete","given":"Alissa"},{"family":"Estrada-Bernal","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Le","given":"Anh T."},{"family":"Truini","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Monique B."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Huiying"},{"family":"Roarty","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Sarah B."},{"family":"Brahmer","given":"Julie R."},{"family":"Altan","given":"Mehmet"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Papadimitrakopoulou","given":"Vassiliki A."},{"family":"Politi","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Doebele","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Kwok-Kin"},{"family":"Heymach","given":"John V."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"robichauxjacqulynep._mechanisms_2018","container-title":"Nature medicine","container-title-short":"Nat.

The majority of these patients (76%) were reclassified as intermediate or higher risk according to R-IPSS. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and PFS were 58% and 54%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, adverse risk factors for PFS were marrow blast percentage (hazard ratio (HR): 1.77, P=0.037), donor/recipient CMV serostatus (donor-/recipient+: HR: 2.02, P=0.011) and source of stem cells (marrow and non-CR: HR: 5.72, P<0.0001, marrow and CR: HR: 3.17, P=0.027). Independent risk factors for OS were disease status at time of transplant and the use of in vivo T-cell depletion (TCD). Patients who did not receive TCD and were transplanted from an unrelated donor had worse OS (HR: 4.08, P<0.0001). In conclusion, 'lower' risk MDS patients have better outcome than those with 'higher risk' after haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

The advantage of HSCT over other treatment comes from retrospective studies and the aim of the current study was to prospectively test this hypothesis, analyzing in particular patients from the pre-transplant period to avoid the selection bias of performing transplantation. This study was conducted to compare overall survival in MDS patients candidates to transplantation according to donor availability. The majority of patients (76%) received a treatment with DMA after registration, 69% had a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor, 70% of whom were transplanted. Baseline patient and disease characteristics were similar according to donor availability. Four-year overall survival was significantly better in patients with an HLA matched donor (37%) compared to patients without donor (15%). There was also evidence that this overall survival advantage was because of transplantation. Mortality risk was decreased after transplantation but it became significant only after the second year post transplant, because of early transplant-related mortality.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of 18F-Fluorodesoxyglucose Positron Emission/Computed Tomography (FDG PET/CT) plus limited screening and limited screening strategies in patients with unprovoked VTE from the perspectives of the Ontario (Canada) and French health care systems.\nMethods: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a published randomized controlled trial of 394 patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with unprovoked VTE. We obtained data with respect to efficacy and health care utilization from the published trial. The primary measure of effectiveness was the number of avoided cases of delayed cancer diagnosis and the secondary measure of effectiveness was the quality adjusted life year (QALY) at the end of the study in each group. We used generalized linear models to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) while controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Results were presented as the incremental cost to avoid one case of delayed cancer diagnosis and the incremental cost per QALY gained. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using bootstrap resampling procedures with 5000 iterations.\nResults: Compared to a limited screening strategy, the ICER of limited strategy plus FDG PET/CT scan was C$ 26,840.19 (95% CI: C$ 24,046.51; C$ 34,581.53) per one avoided case of delayed cancer diagnosis from the Ontario health system perspective and ‚Ç¨16,370.45 (95% CI: ‚Ç¨ 9904.48; ‚Ç¨ 39,578.91) per one avoided case of delayed cancer diagnosis from the French health system perspective.

  {"id":"rodeghiero_standardization_2013","abstract":"In a previous publication on new terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), the International Working Group (IWG) on ITP acknowledged that response to treatment should consist of clinically meaningful end points such as bleeding manifestations and that platelet count may not be the ideal parameter for capturing the benefits of therapy. The IWG now proposes a consensus-based ITP-specific bleeding assessment tool (ITP-BAT) with definitions and terminology consistent with those adopted for other bleeding disorders. Bleeding manifestations were grouped into three major domains: skin (S), visible mucosae (M), and organs (O), with gradation of severity (SMOG).

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib is more effective than standard chemotherapeutic agents in treating ALK positive NSCLC, making molecular diagnostic testing for dysregulated ALK expression a necessary step in identifying optimal treatment modalities. Here we review ALKmediated signal transduction pathways and compare the molecular protocols used to identify dysregulated ALK expression in NSCLC.

Treatment armamentarium has been rapidly growing in this subgroup and includes targeted combinations and immunotherapy for concomitant MSI-H patients, thereby making BRAFMT mCRC an innovative model for precision oncology. Nevertheless, duration of responses to targeted strategies remains unsatisfactory due to the development of secondary resistance, which is currently the field of major clinical research on BRAFMT mCRC. This review explores the molecular, clinical and therapeutic landscape of BRAFMT mCRC as well as an update on current treatment strategies and future perspectives in light of the heterogeneity of BRAF-mutated disease.

Molecular diversity has been shown to occur within specific histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, between different tumors of an individual patient, as well as within individual tumors. Recent advances in the molecular characterization of epithelial ovarian cancer tumors have provided the basis for a simplified classification scheme in which these cancers are classified as either type I or type II tumors, and these two categories have implications regarding disease pathogenesis and prognosis. Molecular analyses, primarily based on next-generation sequencing, otherwise known as high-throughput sequencing, are allowing for further refinement of ovarian cancer classification, facilitating the elucidation of the site(s) of precursor lesions of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and providing insight into the processes of clonal selection and evolution that may be associated with development of chemoresistance.

  {"id":"rosano_endothelin_2013","abstract":"Aberrant expression of endothelin 1 (ET1), or overexpression of endothelin receptors or their linked signalling circuits can contribute to tumour initiation and progression through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. These alteration mechanisms may arise from genetic and epigenetic changes.An intricate network of crosstalk between ET1 signalling and other growth factor pathways drives tumour progression. This includes crosstalk between the endothelin receptors and epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.ET1 signalling promotes cell proliferation, survival, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, neovascularization, response of immune cells and drug resistance in a context-dependent manner. Hence, endothelin receptors have emerged as key targets for cancer therapy.In addition to tumour cells, endothelin receptors are found on tumour-associated host cells, such as blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, thus regulating the contribution of these cell types to cancer progression. Therefore, endothelin receptor antagonists may inhibit tumour progression by blocking crucial signalling events in both the tumour microenvironment and the tumour cells.The activation of ET1 signalling pathways is often negatively correlated with patient outcomes in different types of cancer.Small-molecule antagonists for targeting endothelin receptors have been evaluated in several recent clinical trials. However, the clinical results to date have been disappointing and it is crucial to decipher why the promising preclinical data have not yet been translated to the clinic.Future improved clinical trials might incorporate predictive biomarkers to focus on subsets of patients who are most likely to respond, use other clinical settings or use rational combination therapy with chemotherapeutics or targeted agents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosan√≤","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Spinella","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Bagnato","given":"Anna"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"rosano_endothelin_2013","container-title":"Nature Reviews Cancer","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Cancer","DOI":"10.1038/nrc3546","ISSN":"1474-1768","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9]]},"language":"en","license":"2013 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, the benefit of cancer screening in all VTE patients remains controversial. The Registro Informatizado Enfermedad TromboEmb√≥lica (RIETE) score is a recently proposed risk score to identify VTE patients at high risk of occult cancer. We evaluated the performance of the RIETE score in a routine clinical setting comprising patients presenting with VTE between January 1 and December 31, 2014, at Danderyd University hospital. Out of 488 VTE patients, 47 (9.6%) patients received a new cancer diagnosis during a 24-month follow-up. After exclusion of patients with cancer diagnosed at baseline (‚â§‚Äâ10 days after VTE, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ16), 472 patients were considered eligible for cancer screening. Among these 472 patients, 31 (6.6%) received a cancer diagnosis during follow-up. The cumulative incidence was high after both unprovoked (8.5%) and provoked (4.8%) VTE. The RIETE score was evaluated in 467 of these patients. Interestingly, a high RIETE score was not significantly associated with cancer diagnosis during follow-up (OR 1.78; 95% CI 0.85‚Äì3.63), which was mainly due to a poor performance in women (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.30‚Äì2.83). In summary, we observed a relatively high incidence of occult cancer in both unprovoked and provoked VTE. The RIETE score performed poorly in identifying patients at high risk of occult cancer in our VTE population. Additional risk assessment models are warranted to identify VTE patients who would benefit from extensive cancer screening.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosell","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Lundstr√∂m","given":"Staffan"},{"family":"Mackman","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Wall√©n","given":"H√•kan"},{"family":"Th√•lin","given":"Charlotte"}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"rosell_clinical_2019","container-title":"Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis","container-title-short":"J Thromb Thrombolysis","DOI":"10.1007/s11239-019-01822-z","ISSN":"0929-5305, 1573-742X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"language":"en","page":"111-118","source":"5.221","title":"A clinical practice-based evaluation of the RIETE score in predicting occult cancer in patients with venous thromboembolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11239-019-01822-z","volume":"48"},

Median overall survival in the ITT population was 11.9 months with XELOX versus 12.5 months with FOLFOX-4 (HR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.86-1.21). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 50% of XELOX- and 65% of FOLFOX-4-treated patients. Whereas grade 3/4 neutropenia (35% versus 5% with XELOX) and febrile neutropenia (4% versus < 1%) were more common with FOLFOX-4, grade 3/4 diarrhea (19% versus 5% with FOLFOX-4) and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (4% versus < 1%) were more common with XELOX.\nCONCLUSION: XELOX is noninferior to FOLFOX-4 when administered as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","author":[{"family":"Rothenberg","given":"M.

We investigated dasatinib, another potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy. Patients older than age 55 years were included in the European Working Group on Adult ALL (EWALL) study number 01 for Ph+ ALL (EWALL-PH-01 international study) and were treated with dasatinib 140 mg/day (100 mg/day over 70 years) with intrathecal chemotherapy, vincristine, and dexamethasone during induction. Patients in complete remission continued consolidation with dasatinib, sequentially with cytarabine, asparaginase, and methotrexate for 6 months. Maintenance therapy was dasatinib and vincristine/dexamethasone reinductions for 18 months followed by dasatinib until relapse or death. Seventy-one patients with a median age of 69 years were enrolled; 77% had a high comorbidity score. Complete remission rate was 96% and 65% of patients achieved a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels during consolidation. Only 7 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At 5 years, overall survival was 36% and up to 45% taking into account deaths unrelated to disease or treatment as competitors. Thirty-six patients relapsed, 24 were tested for mutation by Sanger sequencing, and 75% were T315I-positive. BCR-ABL1T315I was tested by allele-specific oligonucleotide reverse transcriptionÔøΩ¢ñæuantitative polymerase chain reaction in 43 patients and detection was associated with short-term relapses. Ten patients (23%) were positive before any therapy and 8 relapsed, all with this mutation. In conclusion, dasatinib combined with low-intensity chemotherapy was well-tolerated and gave long-term survival in 36% of elderly patients with Ph+ ALL. Monitoring of BCR-ABL1T315I from diagnosis identified patients with at high risk of early relapse and may help to personalize therapy.","author":[{"family":"Rousselot","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Coude","given":"marie Magdelaine"},{"family":"GÁππkbuget","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Passerini","given":"Carlo Gambacorti"},{"family":"Hayette","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Cayuela","given":"Jean-Michel"},{"family":"Huguet","given":"FranÁôüoise"},{"family":"Leguay","given":"Thibaut"},{"family":"Chevallier","given":"Patrice"},{"family":"Salanoubat","given":"Celia"},{"family":"Bonmati","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Alexis","given":"Magda"},{"family":"Hunault","given":"Mathilde"},{"family":"Glaisner","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Agape","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Berthou","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Jourdan","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"JosÁüá"},{"family":"Sutton","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Banos","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Reman","given":"Oumedaly"},{"family":"Lioure","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Ifrah","given":"Norbert"},{"family":"Lafage-Pochitaloff","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Bornand","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Morisset","given":"Laure"},{"family":"Robin","given":"ValÁüárie"},{"family":"Pfeifer","given":"Heike"},{"family":"Delannoy","given":"AndrÁüá"},{"family":"Ribera","given":"Josep M."},{"family":"Bassan","given":"Renato"},{"family":"Delord","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Hoelzer","given":"Dieter"},{"family":"Dombret","given":"HervÁüá"},{"family":"Ottmann","given":"Oliver G."}],"citation-key":"rousselot_dasatinib_2016","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2016-02-700153","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"774-782","title":"Dasatinib and low-intensity chemotherapy in elderly patients with philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL","type":"article-journal","volume":"128"},
  {"id":"ruan_assessment_2018","abstract":"Purpose:‚ÄÇ Ultrasound can be used to non-invasively and rapidly examine airway conditions, but vocal cord visualization with the traditional approaches is poor. Our aim was to compare the accuracies of front-side transverse-axis ultrasound (FTU), lateral-side longitudinal-axis ultrasound (LLU), and the combination of both approaches for vocal cord movement disorder diagnoses (e.g., vocal cord paralysis or arytenoid cartilage dislocation).\nMethods:‚ÄÇ We compared FTU, LLU, and the combination of both methods for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We used nasal fiber-optic endoscopy to confirm vocal cord injury.\nResults:‚ÄÇ Among the 120 patients examined, 24 (20%) had vocal cord paralysis. The visualization rate of vocal cords for FTU was 71.7% (assessable, 86; non-assessable, 34), that for LLU was 88.3% (assessable, 106; non-assessable, 14), and that for the combined approach was 96.7% (assessable, 116; non-assessable, 4). The sensitivities and specificities were 58.3% (14/24) and 75% (72/96) for FTU, 91.7% (22/24) and 87.5% (84/96) for LLU, and 100% (24/24) and 95.8% (92/96) for the combined approach.

During the past 10 years, there has been significant progress in the elucidation of the molecular properties of CNS lymphomas and their microenvironment, as well as evolution in the development of novel treatment strategies. Although a CNS lymphoma diagnosis was once assumed to be uniformly associated with a dismal prognosis, it is now reasonable to anticipate long-term survival, and possibly a cure, for a significant fraction of CNS lymphoma patients. The pathogenesis of CNS lymphomas affects multiple compartments within the neuroaxis, and proper treatment of the CNS lymphoma patient requires a multidisciplinary team with expertise not only in hematology/oncology but also in neurology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery, clinical neuropsychology, ophthalmology, pathology, and radiation oncology. Given the evolving principles of management and the evidence for improvements in survival, our goal is to provide an overview of current knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of CNS lymphomas and to highlight promising strategies that we believe to be most effective in establishing diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Rubenstein","given":"James L."},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Neel K."},{"family":"Mannis","given":"Gabriel N."},{"family":"LaMarre","given":"Amanda K."},{"family":"Treseler","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"rubenstein_how_2013","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2013-06-453084","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,3]]},"language":"en","page":"2318-2330","source":"Silverchair","title":"How I treat CNS lymphomas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2013-06-453084","volume":"122"},

  {"id":"rufer_realworld_2022","abstract":"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) constitute a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, persistent peripheral blood cytopenias, and an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1 Treatment with lenalidomide has been recommended for patients with MDS and 5q deletion with symptomatic anemia and a high-transfusion burden with red blood cells (RBC) by several guidelines.2‚Äì4 Little is known about usage, chances, and challenges in daily clinical practice to comply with these guidelines. To close this informative gap an observational, multicenter, national registry, involving the whole spectrum of hematologists and oncologists from primary to tertiary health care centers in Switzerland‚Äîthe Swiss Lenalidomide in MDS del(5q)-Registry (SLIM-Registry)‚Äîwas established. The SLIM-Registry is a web-based clinical data management application. Data entry was performed retrospectively, after at least one cycle of lenalidomide has been applied, and locally by each participating center via a password-protected log-in at the website (www.slim-registry.ch). Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older and had a MDS and a del(5q) with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients were either treated with lenalidomide in the past or treatment with lenalidomide was ongoing at entry into the registry. All living patients provided written informed consent. Patients with MDS without a confirmation of del(5q) were not eligible. The SLIM-Registry was carried out according to all applicable national and local regulatory requirements. There was a regular review and verification of recorded data. From March 1, 2014, until December 31, 2019, patients were included. Data cleaning was performed thereafter, and final database lock was on October 31, 2021. Totally 83 patients (57 females, 26 males) with MDS and del(5q) have been registered in 25 health care centers across Switzerland, which included minimum 1 and maximum 10 patients per center. The majority, 63 patients (75.9%), had a hemoglobin-level below 100 g/L. At diagnosis of MDS, in all patients, a bone marrow (BM) aspirate (with dry tap in 8 patients), and in 78 patients (94%) additionally a BM biopsy was done. Conventional karyotyping was performed in 45 patients, both conventional karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed in 26 patients, and in 12 patients only FISH was done. In 72 patients, there was exquisitely del(5q) detected. With regard to RBC-transfusion dependence (TD) at diagnosis, 41 patients (49.4 %) had RBC-TD with a median hemoglobin of 81 g/L (range, 50‚Äì110 g/L). In 55 patients (66.3%), the diagnosis was myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q) according to WHO Classification 2008. Prognostic stratification was done according to IPSS, IPSS-R, and WPSS (Figure 1A‚ÄìC).Figure 1.: Prognostic scoring systems at diagnosis of MDS. (A) IPSS at diagnosis of MDS, (B) IPSS-R at diagnosis of MDS, and (C) WPSS at diagnosis of MDS. IPSS = International Prognostic Scoring System; IPSS-R = Revised International Prognostic Scoring System; MDS = myelodysplastic syndromes; WPSS = WHO Classification-based Prognostic Scoring System.In total, 1714 cycles of treatment with lenalidomide were recorded. In all patients, at least one cycle of treatment with lenalidomide was given. At start of the first cycle, median hemoglobin was 87 g/L (range, 51‚Äì119 g/L), with 45 patients (54.2%) in need of RBC transfusions. Treatment with lenalidomide was initiated within 6 months after the diagnosis of MDS with a 5q deletion in 55 patients (66.3%). With regard to onset and duration of treatment response, in cycle 2 of treatment with lenalidomide, 22 patients (26.5% of the total cohort and 48.8% of the patients with RBC-TD at treatment start) had RBC-transfusion independence (TI), another 5 (6% and 11.1%, respectively) each in cycle 3 and in cycle 4, 2 patients (3.6% and 4.4%, respectively) in cycle 5, and 1 patient (1.2% and 2.2%, respectively) in cycle 6. Of 61 patients with at least 6 documented treatment cycles 48 patients (78.7%) had RBC-TI for ‚â•8 weeks. Of those, 36 patients (75%) had a diagnosis of MDS with isolated del(5q). Analyzing those 61 patients with regard to erythroid response, there were 28 patients (45.9%) with RBC-TD and a hemoglobin <90 g/L before start of treatment with lenalidomide, 16 patients (57.1%) had an erythroid response, that is, a reduction of at least 4 RBC transfusions with treatment with lenalidomide over a period of 2 months. In those 43 patients with at least 12 documented treatment cycles, 34 patients (79.1%) had RBC-TI for ‚â•26 weeks. The recommended dosage of lenalidomide 10 mg daily on days 1‚Äì21 of a 28-day cycle was administered in 21 patients (25.3%) without adjustments. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was given in 33 patients (39.8%). Of note, there were 5 patients with a treatment-free interval (TFI) for various reasons and durations (Suppl. Table S1). There was a patient who had a complete cytogenetic remission after 6 and after 12 cycles of treatment with lenalidomide. Therefore, treatment was stopped with regular monitoring of blood count and del(5q) by FISH. This patient remains in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission 3 years after stopping treatment. Median overall survival (OS) in a multivariate analysis was significantly longer in patients who received no RBC transfusions during the first treatment cycle of 6.7 years (95% CI, 3.9-9.6) compared with patients who did receive RBC transfusions during that time of 3.34 years (95% CI, 2.56-4.12; P = 0.014), and was significantly longer in patients with MDS with isolated del(5q) of 6.7 years (95% CI, 3.0-10.4) compared with 2.4 years (95% CI, 1.99-2.9) in other entities of MDS (P = 0.004) (Figure 2A,B). With regard to Lenalidomide-emergent adverse events, there were no new safety signals identified.Figure 2.: Median OS. (A) Kaplan-Meier curve for median OS as of start of treatment with lenalidomide according to RBC transfusions during cycle 1 of treatment with lenalidomide in 61 patients with at least 6 documented treatment cycles. There was a significant longer median OS in those 30 patients who received no RBC transfusions during the first cycle of treatment with lenalidomide of 6.7 y (95% CI, 3.9-9.6) compared with 31 patients who did receive RBC transfusions during that time of 3.34 y (95% CI, 2.56-4.12; P = 0.014). (B) Kaplan-Meier curve for median OS as of start of treatment with lenalidomide according to initial diagnosis of MDS. There was a significant longer median OS of 6.7 y (95% CI, 3.0-10.4) in those 55 patients with MDS with isolated del(5q) compared with 2.4 y (95% CI, 1.99-2.9) in 28 patients with other entities of MDS (P = 0.004). CI = confidence intervals; MDS = myelodysplastic syndromes; OS = overall survival; RBC = red blood cells.In conclusion, treatment with lenalidomide was initiated within 6 months after the diagnosis of MDS with 5q deletion in about two-thirds of patients, reflecting the uncertainty with regard to the optimal time point to start disease directed treatment, especially in patients who are not‚Äîyet‚ÄîRBC-transfusion dependent, as lenalidomide is formally approved only for patients with a transfusion-dependent anemia‚Äîand not for preventing it. In all patients, cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis was done. However, in 12 patients (14.5%), only FISH was performed at diagnosis, which is insufficient at initial work up. A minority of patients‚Äî14.5%‚Äîhad higher-risk disease, and treatment with lenalidomide in this patient group would not entirely be in line with current guidelines. With the start of treatment with lenalidomide, 45 patients (54.2%) had RBC-TD, 22 of those patients (48.8%) were free of RBC transfusions in cycle 2, with 5 patients (11.1 %) each in cycle 3 and 4. This rapid onset of response and high efficacy with regard to RBC-TI is in line with the results of the MDS-003- and MDS-004-studies.5,6 Analyzing 61 patients with at least 6 documented cycles of lenalidomide treatment, RBC-TI for ‚â•8 weeks was more common in patients with a diagnosis of MDS with isolated del(5q) compared with other entities of MDS. Analyzing 43 patients with at least 12 documented cycles of lenalidomide treatment, 34 patients (79.1%) had RBC-TI for ‚â•26 weeks. This confirms the high efficacy of lenalidomide with regard to RBC-TI in patients with MDS and 5q deletion also in daily clinical practice.5,6 Two months before start of treatment with lenalidomide, 25 patients (30.1%) of the whole cohort had no RBC-TD. Although off-label, commencing disease directed treatment at that time reflects daily clinical practice of not waiting for a patient with MDS to become RBC-transfusion dependent. Whether this practice will alter the natural course of the disease and has an impact on long-term outcome is not known, as is the optimal time of starting therapy. However, interim analyses of the SINTRA-REV trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01243476) in non-TD LR MDS del(5q) patients suggest that early treatment with lenalidomide at low doses (5 mg) prolongs the time to and decreases the risk of TD with cytogenetic responses.7 This is supported by our data‚Äîalthough not corrected for disease duration and risk stratification‚Äîas patients with no RBC transfusions during the first cycle of treatment with lenalidomide had a significant improvement of median OS (P = 0.014). Renal failure in this elderly population was the most prevalent condition and is possibly the explanation for the fact, that in only 21 patients (25.3%) the recommended lenalidomide dose was given without alterations. Diagnostic evaluation with BM analysis was done in about half of the patients who received 12 treatment cycles, in all other patients treatment with lenalidomide was continued when peripheral blood values were (near) normal without morphological BM or cytogenetic response assessment. Response assessment beyond peripheral blood values seems to be of particular importance, as deep genetic responses are possible and could potentially lead to a treatment-free remission. Clarification on when and how response assessment has to be done is necessary. And there is a clear need for defining patient and disease characteristics with the possibility of a TFI.8 Median OS is significantly longer in lenalidomide-treated patients with MDS and isolated del(5q) compared with patients with other entities of MDS. This is longer compared with the MDS-004 study, which allowed recruitment of all subgroups of patients with MDS and del(5q), including patients with additional chromosomal abnormalities and blasts in BM of up to 10%, but all these patients had RBC-TD, which is in contrast to the SLIM-Registry.6 Observation time in our registry was too short to comment on the long-term safety of lenalidomide and on the possible occurrence of secondary malignancies. There is also a clear need for defining a diagnostic and therapeutic approach after stopping lenalidomide treatment due to intolerance or resistance to the drug with disease progression.

  {"id":"ruff_review_2023","abstract":"Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with 20% of patients presenting with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Metastatic colon cancer is often treated with a combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy), and/or regional therapy (hepatic artery infusion pumps). Utilizing the molecular and pathologic features of the primary tumor to tailor treatment for patients may improve overall survival. Rather than a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach, a more nuanced treatment plan guided by the unique features of a patient‚Äôs tumor and the tumor‚Äôs microenvironment can more effectively treat the disease. Basic science work to elucidate new drug targets, understand mechanisms of evasion, and develop drugs and drug combinations is critical to inform clinical trials and identify novel, effective therapies for metastatic colorectal cancer. Through the lens of key targets for metastatic colorectal cancer, this review discusses how work in the basic science lab translates into clinical trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruff","given":"Samantha M."},{"family":"Pawlik","given":"Timothy M."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"ruff_review_2023","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers15051395","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"5","page":"1395","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"5.2","title":"A Review of Translational Research for Targeted Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/5/1395","volume":"15"},

Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate with an SN-38 payload targeting trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2, an epithelial antigen expressed in breast cancer.\nMETHODS: In this global, randomized, phase III study, SG was compared with physician's choice chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine) in endocrine-resistant, chemotherapy-treated HR+/HER2- locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review.\nRESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive SG (n = 272) or chemotherapy (n = 271). The median age was 56 years, 95% had visceral metastases, and 99% had a prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, with three median lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Primary end point was met with a 34% reduction in risk of progression or death (hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.83; P = .0003]). The median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 7.0) with SG and 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.1 to 4.4) with chemotherapy; the PFS at 6 and 12 months was 46% (95% CI, 39 to 53) v 30% (95% CI, 24 to 37) and 21% (95% CI, 15 to 28) v 7% (95% CI, 3 to 14), respectively.

  {"id":"ryanjacobs_efficacy_2021","abstract":"Abstract Background: Umbralisib, a selective PI3KŒ¥ and casein kinase-1epsilon (CK1Œµ) inhibitor, is pharmacologically distinct from other PI3K inhibitors and is administered orally once daily. Ublituximab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody glycoengineered for enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity that targets a unique epitope on CD20. The primary analysis of the randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 UNITY-CLL trial (NCT02612311) demonstrated that the umbralisib+ublituximab (U2) combination prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chemoimmunotherapy in both treatment-na√Øve (TN) and previously treated (PT) populations (Gribben et al. 2020). Herein, results are presented for patients treated with U2 by treatment status. Methods: Patients ‚â•18 years of age with TN or PT CLL requiring treatment, per iwCLL criteria with adequate organ function and ECOG PS ‚â§2, were eligible. Patients were initially randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive U2, obinutuzumab+chlorambucil (O+Chl), umbralisib monotherapy, or ublituximab monotherapy. Stratification factors included treatment status (treatment-na√Øve vs. previously treated) and deletion 17p status. Umbralisib was administered orally at 800 mg once daily until progression or removal from treatment for other reasons. Ublituximab was administered intravenously at 900 mg on Days 1/2 [split 150/750 mg], 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, Day 1 of Cycles 2 - 6, and on Day 1 every 3 cycles after Cycle 6. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC)-assessed PFS of U2 compared to O+Chl. Key secondary endpoints included IRC-assessed overall response rate (ORR), complete response, undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD), duration of response, and safety, assessed from the first dose until 30 days after the last dose of study medication. While the primary analysis reported results for the pooled intent-to-treat population, the current analysis focuses on outcomes in patients treated with U2 by treatment status. Results: At data cut-off date of May 1, 2020, U2-treated patients had a median follow-up of 35.27 months. Of the 210 patients treated with U2, 119 were TN and 91 were PT. TN patients had a median age of 68 years (39 - 88 years) and 63% were male. Median PFS for U2 in TN patients was 38.5 mos (95% CI, 33.2, NE) with an estimated 24-mo PFS rate of 76.6%. IRC-assessed ORR was 84.0% (95% CI, 77.5%-90.6%). The median duration of exposure to umbralisib and ublituximab was 26.5 and 29.5 mos, respectively. In TN patients, AEs of special interest (AESI) of grade ‚â•3 included: neutropenia (24.1%), diarrhea (13.8%), ALT increased (12.1%), AST increased (7.8%), non-infectious colitis (2.6%), infusion-related reaction (IRR, 0.9%), and pneumonitis (0.9%). Discontinuation of either study drug due to these grade ‚â•3 AESI occurred in 5.2% (neutropenia), 2.6% (diarrhea), 3.4% (ALT increase), 1.7% (AST increase), 1.7% (colitis), 0.9% (IRR), and 0.9% (pneumonitis) of patients. PT patients had a median of 2 prior (1 - 9) lines of therapy, the median age was 65 years (43 - 87 years) and 65.9% were male. Median PFS was 19.5 mos (95% CI, 14.6-27.7) with an estimated 24-mo PFS rate of 41.3%. The IRC-assessed ORR was 82.4% (95% CI, 74.6%-90.2%). Among 14 patients previously treated with ibrutinib, the ORR was 57%. The median duration of exposure to umbralisib and ublituximab were 15.6 mos and 14.6 mos, respectively. In PT patients, AESI of grade ‚â•3 included: neutropenia (40.0%), diarrhea (10.0%), IRR (3.3%), ALT increase (3.3%), AST increase (2.2%), and non-infectious colitis (2.2%). Discontinuation of either study drug due to these grade ‚â•3 AESI occurred in 1.1% (ALT increase), 1.1% (AST increase), and 1.1% (colitis) of patients. Conclusions: U2 demonstrated a tolerable safety profile in both the TN and PT populations. These results mark the first randomized Phase 3 trial of a PI3K in TN CLL, establishing a new mechanism of action in this setting.

  {"id":"s_complications_2019","abstract":"Purpose:‚ÄÇ The use of real-time ultrasound (US) has been shown to reduce complications of central venous (CV) cath‚Äëeterization. However, complication rates have not been compared according to insertion points for CV catheterization using US. Accordingly, this study aimed to compare the complication rates of internal jugular vein (IJV) with those of subclavian vein (SCV) catheterization.\nMethods:‚ÄÇ Three tertiary academic hospitals in South Korea participated in this multicenter, randomized study. A total of 1484 patients were preoperatively randomized into two groups. The IJV group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ742) was cannulated via the right IJV, and the SCV group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ742) was cannulated via the right SCV under US guidance. The primary outcome measure was total complication rate. Secondary outcomes included access time for the first attempt, number of attempts, and catheter position.\nResults:‚ÄÇ The total complication rate did not demonstrate a significant difference between the IJV (0.1%) and SCV (0.7%) groups (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.248). In the IJV group, arterial puncture occurred in 0.1% of patients; in the SCV group, arterial puncture occurred in 0.6% and pneumothorax in 0.1%. The success rate on the first attempt was significantly higher in the IJV group (98.4%) than in the SCV group (95.9%) (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.004). The access time for the first attempt (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and the median number of attempts (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006) were significantly lower in the IJV group than in the SCV group. More catheter misplacements were observed in the SCV group (5.9%) than in the IJV group (0.4%) (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001).\nConclusion:‚ÄÇ Results demonstrated that the complication rates of IJV and SCV catheterizations using US are very low, showing no superiority of the SCV approach compared to the IJV.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"S","given":"hin Hyun-Jung"},{"family":"Na","given":"Hyo-Seok"},{"family":"K","given":"oh Won-Uk"},{"family":"Ro","given":"Young-Jin"},{"family":"L","given":"ee Jung-Man"},{"family":"C","given":"hoi Yoon-Ji"},{"family":"P","given":"ark Seongjoo"},{"family":"K","given":"im Jin-Hee"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"s_complications_2019","container-title":"Intensive Care Medicine","container-title-short":"Intensive Care Med","DOI":"10.1007/s00134-019-05651-9","ISSN":"0342-4642, 1432-1238","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"968-976","source":"41.787","title":"Complications in internal jugular vs subclavian ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization: a comparative randomized trial","title-short":"Complications in internal jugular vs subclavian ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00134-019-05651-9","volume":"45"},

We aimed to do a long-term follow-up analysis of the clinical outcomes and correlative analyses of activity and safety in the full adult cohort.\nMethods\nIn this multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial (JULIET) done at 27 treatment sites in ten countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and the USA), adult patients (‚â•18 years) with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas who were ineligible for, did not consent to, or had disease progression after autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0‚Äì1 at screening, were enrolled. Patients received a single intravenous infusion of tisagenlecleucel (target dose 5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ108 viable transduced CAR T cells). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ie, the proportion of patients with a best overall disease response of a complete response or partial response using the Lugano classification, as assessed by an independent review committee) at any time post-infusion and was analysed in all patients who received tisagenlecleucel (the full analysis set). Safety was analysed in all patients who received tisagenlecleucel. JULIET is registered with ClinialTrials.gov, NCT02445248, and is ongoing.\nFindings\nBetween July 29, 2015, and Nov 2, 2017, 167 patients were enrolled. As of Feb 20, 2020, 115 patients had received tisagenlecleucel infusion and were included in the full analysis set. At a median follow-up of 40¬∑3 months (IQR 37¬∑8‚Äì43¬∑8), the overall response rate was 53¬∑0% (95% CI 43¬∑5‚Äì62¬∑4; 61 of 115 patients), with 45 (39%) patients having a complete response as their best overall response. The most common grade 3‚Äì4 adverse events were anaemia (45 [39%]), decreased neutrophil count (39 [34%]), decreased white blood cell count (37 [32%]), decreased platelet count (32 [28%]), cytokine release syndrome (26 [23%]), neutropenia (23 [20%]), febrile neutropenia (19 [17%]), hypophosphataemia (15 [13%]), and thrombocytopenia (14 [12%]). The most common treatment-related serious adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (31 [27%]), febrile neutropenia (seven [6%]), pyrexia (six [5%]), pancytopenia (three [3%]), and pneumonia (three [3%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.\nInterpretation\nTisagenlecleucel shows durable activity and manageable safety profiles in adult patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. For patients with large B-cell lymphomas that are refractory to chemoimmunotherapy or relapsing after second-line therapies, tisagenlecleucel compares favourably with respect to risk‚Äìbenefit relative to conventional therapeutic approaches (eg, salvage chemotherapy).\nFunding\nNovartis Pharmaceuticals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"S","given":"chuster Stephen J"},{"family":"T","given":"am Constantine S"},{"family":"B","given":"orchmann Peter"},{"family":"W","given":"orel Nina"},{"family":"M","given":"cGuirk Joseph P"},{"family":"H","given":"olte Harald"},{"family":"W","given":"aller Edmund K"},{"family":"J","given":"aglowski Samantha"},{"family":"B","given":"ishop Michael R"},{"family":"D","given":"amon Lloyd E"},{"family":"F","given":"oley Stephen Ronan"},{"family":"W","given":"estin Jason R"},{"family":"F","given":"leury Isabelle"},{"family":"Ho","given":"P Joy"},{"family":"M","given":"ielke Stephan"},{"family":"T","given":"eshima Takanori"},{"family":"J","given":"anakiram Murali"},{"family":"H","given":"su Jing-Mei"},{"family":"I","given":"zutsu Koji"},{"family":"K","given":"ersten Marie Jos√©"},{"family":"G","given":"hosh Monalisa"},{"family":"W","given":"agner-Johnston Nina"},{"family":"K","given":"ato Koji"},{"family":"C","given":"orradini Paolo"},{"family":"M","given":"artinez-Prieto Marcela"},{"family":"H","given":"an Xia"},{"family":"T","given":"iwari Ranjan"},{"family":"S","given":"alles Gilles"},{"family":"M","given":"aziarz Richard T"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"s_longterm_2021","container-title":"The Lancet Oncology","container-title-short":"The Lancet Oncology","DOI":"10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00375-2","ISSN":"1470-2045","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1403-1415","source":"54.433","title":"Long-term clinical outcomes of tisagenlecleucel in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas (JULIET): a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study","title-short":"Long-term clinical outcomes of tisagenlecleucel in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas (JULIET)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204521003752","volume":"22"},

Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to perform such reasoning consistently. Here we propose an approach to pinpoint and rectify multi-hop reasoning failures through targeted memory injections on LLM attention heads. First, we analyze the per-layer activations of GPT-2 models in response to single and multi-hop prompts. We then propose a mechanism that allows users to inject pertinent prompt-specific information, which we refer to as \"memories,\" at critical LLM locations during inference. By thus enabling the LLM to incorporate additional relevant information during inference, we enhance the quality of multi-hop prompt completions. We show empirically that a simple, efficient, and targeted memory injection into a key attention layer can often increase the probability of the desired next token in multi-hop tasks, by up to 424%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"S","given":"akarvadia Mansi"},{"family":"A","given":"jith Aswathy"},{"family":"K","given":"han Arham"},{"family":"G","given":"rzenda Daniel"},{"family":"H","given":"udson Nathaniel"},{"family":"B","given":"auer Andr√©"},{"family":"C","given":"hard Kyle"},{"family":"F","given":"oster Ian"}],"citation-key":"s_memory_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2309.05605","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,11]]},"number":"arXiv:2309.05605","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Memory Injections: Correcting Multi-Hop Reasoning Failures during Inference in Transformer-Based Language Models","title-short":"Memory Injections","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05605"},

  {"id":"s_unmet_2022","abstract":"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an ultra-rare, blood-clotting disorder. Management historically relies on plasma exchange and immunosuppression; however, a 10%-20% mortality rate is still observed. Caplacizumab binds to von Willebrand factor and directly inhibits platelet aggregation; addition of caplacizumab to historical treatment induced faster resolution of platelet count in clinical trials. In 2019, a modified-Delphi study was conducted with UK experts, to develop consensus statements on management of acute TTP and the potential role of caplacizumab. An unmet need was acknowledged, and areas requiring improvement included: time to diagnosis and treatment initiation; time to platelet normalisation (TTPN) during which patients remain at risk of persistent microvascular thrombosis and organ damage; and incidence of subsequent exacerbations and relapses. Caplacizumab addition to historical treatment within 24¬†h (after confirmatory ADAMTS13 [a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13] assay) would significantly reduce TTPN, which directly influences acute outcomes, with manageable bleeding risk and reduced burden on healthcare systems. Expert panellists agree that poor outcomes in iTTP largely result from failure to rapidly control microvascular thrombosis. Use of caplacizumab during a confirmed iTTP episode could offer better control and may plausibly improve long-term outcomes. However, this consensus must be validated with further clinical trials and robust real-world evidence.","author":[{"family":"S","given":"cully Marie"},{"family":"D","given":"utt Tina"},{"family":"L","given":"ester Will"},{"family":"F","given":"arrington Emily"},{"family":"L","given":"ockwood Stevie"},{"family":"P","given":"erry Richard"},{"family":"H","given":"olmes Steve"}],"citation-key":"s_unmet_2022","container-title":"EJHaem","container-title-short":"EJHaem","DOI":"10.1002/jha2.435","ISSN":"2688-6146","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"619-627","PMCID":"PMC9422011","PMID":"36051029","source":"PubMed","title":"Unmet needs in the management of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the potential role of caplacizumab in the UK-A modified-Delphi study","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

Despite benefits of bevacizumab in cancer therapy, it is clear that the VEGF pathway is complex, involving multiple isoforms, receptors, and alternative ligands such as VEGF-B, and placental growth factor, which could enable escape from VEGF-A-targeted angiogenesis inhibition. Recently developed therapies have targeted other ligands in the VEGF pathway (eg, aflibercept, known as ziv-aflibercept in the United States), VEGF receptors (eg, ramucirumab), and their tyrosine kinase signaling (ie, tyrosine kinase inhibitors).

The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).\nRESULTS: A total of 1,401 patients were randomly assigned in this 2 x 2 analysis. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.4 months in the bevacizumab group and 8.0 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 97.5% CI, 0.72 to 0.95; P = .0023). Median overall survival was 21.3 months in the bevacizumab group and 19.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.89; 97.5% CI, 0.76 to 1.03; P = .077). Response rates were similar in both arms. Analysis of treatment withdrawals showed that, despite protocol allowance of treatment continuation until disease progression, only 29% and 47% of bevacizumab and placebo recipients, respectively, were treated until progression. The toxicity profile of bevacizumab was consistent with that documented in previous trials.\nCONCLUSION: The addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved PFS in this first-line trial in patients with MCRC. Overall survival differences did not reach statistical significance, and response rate was not improved by the addition of bevacizumab. Treatment continuation until disease progression may be necessary in order to optimize the contribution of bevacizumab to therapy.","author":[{"family":"Saltz","given":"Leonard B."},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"D√≠az-Rubio","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Scheithauer","given":"Werner"},{"family":"Figer","given":"Arie"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Koski","given":"Sheryl"},{"family":"Lichinitser","given":"Mikhail"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Tsai-Shen"},{"family":"Rivera","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Couture","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Sirz√©n","given":"Florin"},{"family":"Cassidy","given":"Jim"}],"citation-key":"saltz_bevacizumab_2008","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2007.14.9930","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"2013-2019","PMID":"18421054","source":"PubMed","title":"Bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase III study","title-short":"Bevacizumab in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

There is no publication in the field of critical care medicine prepared using this approach; however, this will be a possibility in the next future. ChatGPT work should not be used as a replacement for human judgment and the output should always be reviewed by experts before being used in any critical decision-making or application. Moreover, several ethical issues arise about using these tools, such as the risk of plagiarism and inaccuracies, as well as a potential imbalance in its accessibility between high- and low-income countries, if the software becomes paying.

  {"id":"sammut_multiomic_2022","abstract":"Breast cancers are complex ecosystems of malignant cells and the tumour microenvironment1. The composition of these tumour ecosystems and interactions within them contribute to responses to¬†cytotoxic therapy2. Efforts to build response predictors have not incorporated this knowledge. We collected clinical, digital pathology, genomic and transcriptomic profiles of pre-treatment biopsies of breast tumours from 168 patients treated with chemotherapy with or without HER2 (encoded by ERBB2)-targeted therapy before surgery. Pathology end points (complete response or residual disease) at surgery3 were then correlated with multi-omic features in these diagnostic biopsies. Here we show that response to treatment is modulated by the pre-treated tumour ecosystem, and its multi-omics landscape can be integrated in predictive models using machine learning. The degree of residual disease following therapy is monotonically associated with pre-therapy features, including tumour mutational and copy number landscapes, tumour proliferation, immune infiltration and T cell dysfunction and exclusion. Combining these features into a multi-omic machine learning model predicted a¬†pathological complete response in an external validation cohort (75 patients) with an area under the curve of 0.87. In conclusion, response to therapy is determined by the baseline characteristics of the totality of the tumour ecosystem captured through data integration and machine learning.

  {"id":"samra_discontinuation_2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to chemotherapy has dramatically improved outcomes of patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). When allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is performed, maintenance TKI is generally given for a fixed duration. However, the optimal duration of TKI outside of HSCT remains unknown, and the common practice is to continue indefinitely. Here, we report characteristics and outcomes of 9 patients treated with chemotherapy + TKI without HSCT and later discontinued TKI. METHODS Among 188 patients with Ph-positive ALL who did not undergo HSCT, 9 of them discontinued maintenance TKI mainly due to side effects. Patients were closely monitored with serial PCR testing for the BCR-ABL1 transcript. Major molecular response (MMR) was defined as BCR-ABL1 transcript ÔøΩÔøΩ0.1% on the international scale for p210 transcripts and a 3-log reduction from baseline for p190 transcripts. Deep molecular remission (DMR) was defined as the absence of quantifiable BCR-ABL1 transcripts with a sensitivity of 0.01%. Molecular relapse was defined as loss of MMR. Treatment-free remission (TFR) was defined from time of TKI discontinuation to molecular relapse, last follow-up, or death from any cause. RESULTS At the time of TKI discontinuation, transcript level was undetected in 6 patients, <0.01% in 2 patients, and 0.01% in another patient. Prior to discontinuation, the median duration of TKI therapy and of DMR was 70 and 47 months, respectively. No morphological relapse occurred. Three patients (33%) had molecular relapse at a median of 6 months. All 3 resumed TKI therapy, and 2 of them regained DMR after a median of 13 months. After a median follow-up of 49 months, the median TFR was not reached, and the 4-year TFR rate was 65%. The median duration of DMR in patients with and without molecular relapse was 22 and 58 months, respectively (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION TKI discontinuation outside of HSCT in Ph-positive ALL in the setting of compelling toxicity may be safe only among a highly selected group of patients with deep and prolonged DMR undergoing close and frequent monitoring. Validation of these findings in prospective clinical trials is highly needed.","author":[{"family":"Samra","given":"Bachar"},{"family":"Kantarjian","given":"Hagop M."},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Alotaibi","given":"Ahmad S."},{"family":"Konopleva","given":"Marina"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Ferrajoli","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Garris","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Nunez","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Kadia","given":"Tapan M."},{"family":"Short","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Jabbour","given":"Elias"}],"citation-key":"samra_discontinuation_2020","container-title":"Acta Haematologica","container-title-short":"Acta Haematol.","DOI":"10.1159/000510112","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"285-292","title":"Discontinuation of maintenance tyrosine kinase inhibitors in philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia outside of transplant","type":"article-journal","volume":"144"},

There were significant differences in several relevant characteristics at presentation between patients receiving (n¬†=¬†86) or not receiving lenalidomide (n¬†=¬†129). The 5-year time-dependent probabilities of OS and progression to AML were 62% and 31% for patients receiving lenalidomide and 42% and 25% for patients not receiving lenalidomide; differences were not statistically significant in multivariate analysis that included all variables independently associated with those outcomes (OS, P¬†=¬†0¬∑45; risk of AML, P¬†=¬†0¬∑31, respectively). Achievement of RBC transfusion independency (P¬†=¬†0¬∑069) or cytogenetic response (P¬†=¬†0¬∑021) after lenalidomide was associated with longer OS in multivariate analysis.

The FISH assay can be technically challenging and difficult to interpret. ALK immunohistochemistry and next generation sequencing have been proposed as alternative approaches. In this study, we compared various ALK ÔøΩÁÑÖISH patterns to next ÔøΩÂ≠Ñeneration sequencing (NGS) for gene fusion detection, ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tumor responses to crizotinib. 72 (4%) of 2116 lung adenocarcinoma were positive by ALK- FISH. Of 28 ALK -FISH positive cases selected for the study, FISH patterns included 15 (54%) cases with split signal, 10 (36%) with single orange signal and 3 (10%) with ÔøΩÈ®¶ixed patternÔøΩÔøΩ. 12 (80%) cases with split signal and 4 (40%) cases with single orange signal were positive by NGS and IHC, while mixed cases were all negative. Mutation analysis of discordant cases revealed multiple mutations including oncogenic mutations in EGFR , KRAS , BRAF and ATM genes. All discordant cases in groups with split and mixed signal showed a lower number of cells with rearrangement (mean 28.5%; range 20.5-36.9%). No statistically significant association between response to crizotinib and FISH patterns was observed (p=0.73). In contrast, NGS fusion positive cases were associated with more responses to crizotinib than NGS negative cases (p= 0.016). Our study suggests that ALK FISH alone may not be the most reliable assay for detection of ALK gene rearrangements, and probably should be used in parallel with ALK IHC and NGS for detection of gene fusions and mutations.","author":[{"family":"Sanja","given":""},{"family":"Villaruz","given":"Liza C."},{"family":"Abberbock","given":"Shira"},{"family":"Mahaffey","given":"Alyssa L."},{"family":"Incharoen","given":"Pimpin"},{"family":"Nikiforova","given":"Marina N.

We analysed real-world datasets to determine the frequency of ex20ins variants, and the ability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify them. Three real-world United States NGS databases were used: GENIE, FoundationInsights, and GuardantINFORM. Mutation profiles consistent with in-frame EGFR ex20ins were summarized. GENIE, FoundationInsights, and GuardantINFORM datasets identified 180, 627, and 627 patients with EGFR ex20ins respectively. The most frequent insertion region of exon 20 was the near loop (~ 70%), followed by the far loop (~ 30%) and the helical (~ 3-6%) regions. GENIE, FoundationInsights, and GuardantINFORM datasets identified 41, 102, and 96 unique variants respectively. An analysis of variants projected that ~ 50% of EGFR ex20ins identified by NGS would have been missed by PCR-based assays. Given the breadth of EGFR ex20ins identified in the real-world US datasets, the ability of PCR to identify these mutations is limited. NGS platforms are more appropriate to identify patients likely to benefit from EGFR ex20ins-targeted therapies.","author":[{"family":"Santiago","given":""},{"family":"Minchom","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Bazhenova","given":"Lyudmila"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"},{"family":"Bauml","given":"Joshua M"},{"family":"Shell","given":"Scott A"},{"family":"Schaffer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Junchen"},{"family":"Rose","given":"Jennifer B"},{"family":"Curtin","given":"Joshua C"},{"family":"Mahadevia","given":"Parthiv"},{"family":"Girard","given":"Nicolas Viteri"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"santiago_frequency_2022","container-title":"Molecular oncology","container-title-short":"Mol.

There is an urgent and unmet need of approaches to optimally manage emerging adverse events that extend beyond the standard paradigm of cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Although management guidelines exist for ICANS, there is little guidance on how to approach patients with neurologic comorbidities, and how to manage rare neurotoxicity presentations, such as CAR T-cell therapy-related cerebral edema, severe motor complications or late-onset neurotoxicity. In this study, we present 3 scenarios of patients treated with CAR T cells who develop unique types of neurotoxicity, and we describe an approach for the evaluation and management based on experience because objective data are limited.

Guideline development involved a systematic literature review and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on evidence published from 2017 to 2021.\nRESULTS: The systematic review identified 35 eligible publications. Because of the paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are based on expert consensus.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: The multidisciplinary team issued recommendations to aid in the recognition, workup, evaluation, and management of the most common CAR T-cell-related toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, B-cell aplasia, cytopenias, and infections. Management of short-term toxicities associated with CAR T cells begins with supportive care for most patients, but may require pharmacologic interventions for those without adequate response. Management of patients with prolonged or severe CAR T-cell-associated cytokine release syndrome includes treatment with tocilizumab with or without a corticosteroid. On the basis of the potential for rapid decline, patients with moderate to severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome should be managed with corticosteroids and supportive care.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines.","author":[{"family":"Santomasso","given":"Bianca D."},{"family":"Nastoupil","given":"Loretta J."},{"family":"Adkins","given":"Sherry"},{"family":"Lacchetti","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Bryan J."},{"family":"Anadkat","given":"Milan"},{"family":"Atkins","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Brassil","given":"Kelly J."},{"family":"Caterino","given":"Jeffrey M."},{"family":"Chau","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Marianne J."},{"family":"Ernstoff","given":"Marc S."},{"family":"Fecher","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Funchain","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Jaiyesimi","given":"Ishmael"},{"family":"Mammen","given":"Jennifer S."},{"family":"Naidoo","given":"Jarushka"},{"family":"Naing","given":"Aung"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Tanyanika"},{"family":"Porter","given":"Laura D."},{"family":"Reichner","given":"Cristina A."},{"family":"Seigel","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Song","given":"Jung-Min"},{"family":"Spira","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Suarez-Almazor","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Swami","given":"Umang"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"John A."},{"family":"Vikas","given":"Praveen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yinghong"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Jeffrey S."},{"family":"Bollin","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Monalisa"}],"citation-key":"santomasso_management_2021","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"sasaki_prognostic_2021","abstract":"Background The achievement of a 3-month complete molecular response (CMR) is a major prognostic factor for survival in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, 25% of patients relapse during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Methods The authors reviewed 204 patients with Ph-positive ALL who were treated between January 2001 and December 2018 using the combination of hyper-CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) plus a TKI (imatinib, 44 patients [22%]; dasatinib, 88 patients [43%]; or ponatinib, 72 patients [35%]). Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start date of therapy to the date of relapse, death, or last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start date of therapy to the date of death or last follow-up. Results Overall, a 3-month CMR was observed in 57% of patients, including 32% of those who received imatinib, 52% of those who received dasatinib, and 74% of those who received ponatinib. The median follow-up was 74 months (imatinib, 180 months; dasatinib, 106 months; ponatinib, 43 months). Among 84 patients in 3-month CMR, 17 (20%) proceeded to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 68% and 72%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, ponatinib therapy was the only significant favorable independent factor predicting for progression (P = .028; hazard ratio, 0.388; 95% CI, 0.166-0.904) and death (P = .042; hazard ratio, 0.379; 95% CI, 0.149-0.966). ASCT was not a prognostic factor for PFS and OS by univariate analysis. Conclusions In patients with Ph-positive ALL, ponatinib is superior to other types of TKIs in inducing and maintaining a CMR, thus preventing disease progression. ASCT does not improve outcome once a 3-month CMR is achieved.","author":[{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Kantarjian","given":"Hagop M."},{"family":"Short","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Samra","given":"Bachar"},{"family":"Khoury","given":"Joseph D."},{"family":"Shamanna","given":"Rashmi Kanagal"},{"family":"Konopleva","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Nitin"},{"family":"DiNardo","given":"Courtney D."},{"family":"Khouri","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Garcia-Manero","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Kadia","given":"Tapan M."},{"family":"Wierda","given":"William G."},{"family":"Khouri","given":"Issa F."},{"family":"Kebriaei","given":"Partow"},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Rohtesh S."},{"family":"Champlin","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Garris","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Cora M."},{"family":"Daver","given":"Naval"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Yilmaz","given":"Musa"},{"family":"Ravandi","given":"Farhad"},{"family":"Jabbour","given":"Elias"}],"citation-key":"sasaki_prognostic_2021","container-title":"Cancer","container-title-short":"Cancer-am.

  {"id":"sato_nelarabine_2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has distinct biological characteristics and a poorer prognosis than B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This trial aimed to reduce the rate of radiation and haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) while improving outcomes by adding nelarabine, intensified L-asparaginase, and protracted intrathecal therapy in the Berlin-Frankfurt-M√ºnster (BFM)-type treatment.\nMETHODS: In this nationwide, multicenter, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (age <25 years at diagnosis) conducted by Japan Children's Cancer Group and Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group. Patients were stratified into standard-risk, high-risk, and very-high-risk groups according to prednisolone response, CNS status, and end-of-consolidation minimal residual disease. We used the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)-BFM-ALL 2000-backbone chemotherapy. Nelarabine (650 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) was given to high-risk and very high-risk patients. All patients received, until the measurement of end-of-consolidation minimal residual disease, an identical therapy schedule, which included the prednisolone pre-phase remission induction therapy with dexamethasone (10 mg/m2 per day, for 3 weeks [for patients <10 years] or for 2 weeks including a 7-day off interval [for patients ‚â•10 years]) instead of prednisolone, and consolidation therapy added with Escherichia coli-derived L-asparaginase. On the basis of the stratification, patients received different intensities of treatment; L-asparaginase-intensified standard BFM-type therapy for standard risk and nelarabine-added high risk BFM-type therapy for high risk. In the very high-risk group, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to group A (BFM-based block therapy) and group B (another block therapy, including high-dose dexamethasone) stratified by hospital, age (‚â•18 years or <18 years), and end-of-induction bone marrow blast percentage of M1 (<5%) or M2 (‚â•5%, <25%)+M3 (‚â•25%). Cranial radiotherapy was limited to patients with overt CNS disease at diagnosis (CNS3; >5 white blood cells per ŒºL with blasts) and patients with no evidence of CNS disease received protracted triple intrathecal therapy. Only very high-risk patients were scheduled to receive HSCT. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival for the entire cohort and the proportion of patients with disappearance of minimal residual disease between randomly assigned groups A and B in the very high-risk group. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, remission induction rate, and occurrence of adverse events. 3 years after the completion of patient accrual, a primary efficacy analysis was performed in the full analysis set and the per-protocol set. This study is registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCTs041180145.\nFINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2011, and Nov 30, 2017, of 349 eligible patients (median age 9 years [IQR 6-13]), 238 (68%) were male, and 28 (8%) patients had CNS3 status. 168 (48%) patients were stratified as standard risk, 103 (30%) as high risk, 39 (11%) as very high risk, and 39 (11%) as no risk (patients who had off protocol treatment before risk assessment. The composite complete remission (complete remission plus complete remission in suppression) rate after remission induction therapy was 89% (298 of 335 patients). HSCT was performed in 35 (10%) of 333 patients. With a median follow-up of 5¬∑2 years (IQR 3¬∑6-6¬∑7), 3-year event-free survival was 86¬∑4% (95% CI 82¬∑3-89¬∑7%) and 3-year overall survival was 91¬∑3% (87¬∑7-93¬∑8%). The proportion of minimal residual disease disappearance was 0¬∑86 (12 of 14 patients; 95% CI 0¬∑57-0¬∑98) in group A and 0¬∑50 (6 of 12 patients, 0¬∑21-0¬∑79) in group B. Grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy was seen in 11 (3%) of 349 patients and sensory neuropathy was seen in 6 (2%) patients. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse event was febrile neutropenia (294 [84%] of 349 patients).

  {"id":"sauta_realworld_2023","abstract":"<AbstractText Label=\"PURPOSE\">Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous myeloid neoplasms in which a risk-adapted treatment strategy is needed. Recently, a new clinical-molecular prognostic model, the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M) was proposed to improve the prediction of clinical outcome of the currently available tool (Revised International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS-R]). We aimed to provide an extensive validation of IPSS-M.</AbstractText>\n<AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\">A total of 2,876 patients with primary MDS from the GenoMed4All consortium were retrospectively analyzed.</AbstractText>\n<AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\">IPSS-M improved prognostic discrimination across all clinical end points with respect to IPSS-R (concordance was 0.81 <i>v</i> 0.74 for overall survival and 0.89 <i>v</i> 0.76 for leukemia-free survival, respectively). This was true even in those patients without detectable gene mutations. Compared with the IPSS-R based stratification, the IPSS-M risk group changed in 46% of patients (23.6% and 22.4% of subjects were upstaged and downstaged, respectively).In patients treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), IPSS-M significantly improved the prediction of the risk of disease relapse and the probability of post-transplantation survival versus IPSS-R (concordance was 0.76 <i>v</i> 0.60 for overall survival and 0.89 <i>v</i> 0.70 for probability of relapse, respectively).

  {"id":"scaltriti_molecular_2016","abstract":"AXL is a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor that signals via PI3K, MAPK, and protein kinase C (PKC), among other pathways. AXL has oncogenic potential and interacts with other membrane receptors, depending on their relative abundance and availability. The increased expression of AXL in cancer is often the result of pharmacologic selective pressure to a number of chemotherapies and targeted therapies and acts as a mechanism of acquired drug resistance. This resistance phenotype, frequently accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, can be reversed by AXL inhibition. In tumors with high levels of EGFR, including lung, head and neck, and triple-negative breast cancer, AXL dimerizes with this receptor and initiates signaling that circumvents the antitumor effects of anti-EGFR therapies. Likewise, AXL overexpression and dimerization with EGFR can overcome PI3K inhibition by activating the phospholipase C-Â∏†-PKC cascade that, in turn, sustains mTORC1 activity. The causative role of AXL in inducing drug resistance is underscored by the fact that the suppression of AXL restores sensitivity to these agents. Hence, these observations indicate that AXL is selectively expressed in tumor cells refractory to therapy and that cotargeting AXL in this setting would potentially overcome drug resistance. The use of AXL inhibitors should be considered in the clinic. Clin Cancer Res; 22(6); 1313ÔøΩÔøΩ7.

  {"id":"schoenfeld_severe_2019","abstract":"ABSTRACT Background Concurrent programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-(L)1) plus osimertinib is associated with severe immune related adverse events (irAE) in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Now that PD-(L)1 inhibitors are routinely used as adjuvant and first-line treatments, sequential PD-(L)1 inhibition followed by osimertinib use may become more frequent and have unforeseen serious toxicity. Methods We identified patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were treated with PD-(L)1 blockade and EGFR- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), irrespective of drug or sequence of administration (total n=126). Patient records were reviewed to identify severe (NCI-CTCAE v5.0 grades 3ÔøΩÔøΩ4) toxicity. Results Fifteen percent [6 of 41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7% to 29%] of all patients treated with sequential PD-(L)1 blockade followed later by osimertinib developed a severe irAE. Severe irAEs were most common among those who began osimertinib within 3months of prior PD-(L)1 blockade (5 of 21, 24%, 95% CI 10% to 45%), as compared with >3ÔøΩÔøΩ12months (1 of 8, 13%, 95% CI 0% to 50%), >12months (0 of 12, 0%, 95% CI 0% to 28%). By contrast, no severe irAEs were identified among patients treated with osimertinib followed by PD-(L)1 (0 of 29, 95% CI 0% to 14%) or PD-(L)1 followed by other EGFR-TKIs (afatinib or erlotinib, 0 of 27, 95% CI 0% to 15%). IrAEs occurred at a median onset of 20days after osimertinib (range 14ÔøΩÔøΩ167days). All patients with irAEs required steroids and most required hospitalization. Conclusion PD-(L)1 blockade followed by osimertinib is associated with severe irAE and is most frequent among patients who recently received PD-(L)1 blockade. No irAEs were observed when osimertinib preceded PD-(L)1 blockade or when PD-(L)1 was followed by other EGFR-TKIs. This association appears to be specific to osimertinib, as no severe irAEs occurred with administration of other EGFR-TKIs.","author":[{"family":"Schoenfeld","given":"Adam J."},{"family":"Arbour","given":"Kathryn C."},{"family":"Rizvi","given":"Hira"},{"family":"Iqbal","given":"A."},{"family":"Gadgeel","given":"Shirish M."},{"family":"Girshman","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Kris","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Riely","given":"G.

  {"id":"schoenfeld_tumor_2020","abstract":"Purpose: Patterns of resistance to first-line osimertinib are not well-established and have primarily been evaluated using plasma assays, which cannot detect histologic transformation and have differential sensitivity for copy number changes and chromosomal rearrangements. Experimental Design: To characterize mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib, patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers who received osimertinib at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and had next-generation sequencing performed on tumor tissue before osimertinib initiation and after progression were identified. Results: Among 62 patients who met eligibility criteria, histologic transformation, primarily squamous transformation, was identified in 15% of first-line osimertinib cases and 14% of later-line cases. Nineteen percent (5/27) of patients treated with first-line osimertinib had off-target genetic resistance (2 MET amplification, 1 KRAS mutation, 1 RET fusion, and 1 BRAF fusion) whereas 4% (1/27) had an acquired EGFR mutation (EGFR G724S). Patients with squamous transformation exhibited considerable genomic complexity; acquired PIK3CA mutation, chromosome 3q amplification, and FGF amplification were all seen. Patients with transformation had shorter time on osimertinib and shorter survival compared with patients with on-target resistance. Initial EGFR sensitizing mutation, time on osimertinib treatment, and line of therapy also influenced resistance mechanism that emerged. The compound mutation EGFR S768 + V769L and the mutation MET H1094Y were identified and validated as resistance mechanisms with potential treatment options. Conclusions: Histologic transformation and other off-target molecular alterations are frequent early emerging resistance mechanisms to osimertinib and are associated with poor clinical outcomes.

  {"id":"schorb_highdose_2024","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Available treatments for older patients with primary diffuse large B-cell CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) offer progression-free survival of up to 16 months. We aimed to investigate an intensified treatment of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in older patients with PCNSL.\nMETHODS: MARTA was a prospective, single-arm, phase 2 study done at 15 research hospitals in Germany. Patients aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed, untreated PCNSL were enrolled if they had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and were fit for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT. Induction treatment consisted of two 21-day cycles of high-dose intravenous methotrexate 3¬∑5 g/m2 (day 1), intravenous cytarabine 2 g/m2 twice daily (days 2 and 3), and intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 (days 0 and 4) followed by high-dose chemotherapy with intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 (day -8), intravenous busulfan 3¬∑2 mg/kg (days -7 and -6), and intravenous thiotepa 5 mg/kg (days -5 and -4) plus autologous HSCT. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 12 months in all patients who met eligibility criteria and started treatment. The study was registered with the German clinical trial registry, DRKS00011932, and recruitment is complete.\nFINDINGS: Between Nov 28, 2017, and Sept 16, 2020, 54 patients started induction treatment and 51 were included in the full analysis set. Median age was 71 years (IQR 68-75); 27 (53%) patients were female and 24 (47%) were male. At a median follow-up of 23¬∑0 months (IQR 16¬∑8-37¬∑4), 23 (45%) of 51 patients progressed, relapsed, or died. 12-month progression-free survival was 58¬∑8% (80% CI 48¬∑9-68¬∑2; 95% CI 44¬∑1-70¬∑9). During induction treatment, the most common grade 3-5 toxicities were thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (each in 52 [96%] of 54 patients). During high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT, the most common grade 3-5 toxicity was leukopenia (37 [100%] of 37 patients). Treatment-related deaths were reported in three (6%) of 54 patients, all due to infectious complications.\nINTERPRETATION: Although the primary efficacy threshold was not met, short induction followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT is active in selected older patients with PCNSL and could serve as a benchmark for comparative trials.\nFUNDING: Else Kr√∂ner-Fresenius Foundation, Riemser Pharma, and Medical Center-University of Freiburg.","author":[{"family":"Schorb","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Isbell","given":"Lisa Kristina"},{"family":"Kerkhoff","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Mathas","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Braulke","given":"Friederike"},{"family":"Egerer","given":"Gerlinde"},{"family":"R√∂th","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Schliffke","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Borchmann","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Brunnberg","given":"Uta"},{"family":"Kroschinsky","given":"Frank"},{"family":"M√∂hle","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Rank","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Wellnitz","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Kasenda","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Pospiech","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Wendler","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Deckert","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Henkes","given":"Elina"},{"family":"Gottberg","given":"Philipp","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Gmehlin","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Backenstra√ü","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Jensch","given":"Antje"},{"family":"Burger-Martin","given":"Elvira"},{"family":"Grishina","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Fricker","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Malenica","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Orb√°n","given":"Andr√°s"},{"family":"Duyster","given":"Justus"},{"family":"Ihorst","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Finke","given":"Juergen"},{"family":"Illerhaus","given":"Gerald"}],"citation-key":"schorb_highdose_2024","container-title":"The Lancet.

  {"id":"schrock_receptor_2018","abstract":"Abstract Introduction We analyzed a large set of EGFR-mutated (EGFR+) NSCLC to identify and characterize cases with co-occurring kinase fusions as potential resistance mechanisms to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Methods EGFR+ (del 19, L858R, G719X, S768I, L851Q) NSCLC clinical samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor and blood) were analyzed for the presence of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and BRAF fusions. Treatment history and response were obtained from provided pathology reports and treating clinicians. Results Clinical samples from 3505 unique EGFR+ NSCLCs were identified from June 2012 to October 2017. A total of 31 EGFR+ cases had concurrent kinase fusions detected: 10 (32%) BRAF, 7 (23%) ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), 6 (19%) ret proto-oncogene (RET), 6 (19%) fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), 1 (3.2%) EGFR, and 1 (3.2%) neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1), including two novel fusions (SALL2-BRAF and PLEKHA7-ALK). Twenty-seven of 31 patients had either a known history of EGFR+ NSCLC diagnosis or prior treatment with an EGFR TKI before the fusion+ sample was collected. Twelve of the 27 patients had paired pre-treatment samples where the fusion was not present before treatment with an EGFR TKI. Multiple patients treated with combination therapy targeting EGFR and the acquired fusion had clinical benefit, including one patient with osimertinib resistance due to an acquired PLEKHA7-ALK fusion achieving a durable partial response with combination of full-dose osimertinib and alectinib. Conclusions RTK and BRAF fusions are rare but potentially druggable resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs. Detection of RTK and BRAF fusions should be part of comprehensive profiling panels to determine resistance to EGFR TKIs and direct appropriate combination therapeutic strategies.","author":[{"family":"Schrock","given":"Alexa B."},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Viola W."},{"family":"Hsieh","given":"Wen-Son"},{"family":"Madison","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Creelan","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Silberberg","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Costin","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Bharne","given":"Anjali"},{"family":"Bonta","given":"Ioana"},{"family":"Bosemani","given":"Thangavijayan"},{"family":"Nikolinakos","given":"Petros"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Jeffrey S."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Vincent A."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Siraj M."},{"family":"Klempner","given":"Samuel J."},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"}],"citation-key":"schrock_receptor_2018","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"schroeder_azacitidine_2023","abstract":"Azacitidine (Aza) combined with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) is an established treatment for relapse of myeloid malignancies after allogeneic transplantation. Based on its immunomodulatory and anti-leukemic properties we considered Lenalidomide (Lena) to act synergistically with Aza/DLI to improve outcome. We, therefore, prospectively investigated tolerability and efficacy of this combination as first salvage therapy for adults with post-transplant relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Patients were scheduled for eight cycles Aza (75 mg/m2 day 1-7), Lena (2.5 or 5 mg, days 1-21) and up to three DLI with increasing T-cell dosages (0.5√ó106-1.5√ó107 cells/kg). Primary endpoint was safety, while secondary endpoints included response, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and overall survival (OS). Fifty patients with molecular (52%) or hematological (48%) relapse of myelodysplastic syndromes (n=24), acute myeloid leukemia (n=23) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=3) received a median of seven (range, 1-8) cycles including 14 patients with 2.5 mg and 36 with 5 mg Lena daily dosage. Concomitantly, 34 patients (68%) received at least one DLI. Overall response rate was 56% and 25 patients (50%) achieved complete remission being durable in 80%. Median OS was 21 months and 1-year OS rate 65% with no impact of type of or time to relapse and Lena dosages. Treatment was well tolerated indicated by febrile neutropenia being the only grade ‚â•3 non-hematologic adverse event in >10% of patients and modest acute (grade 2-4 24%) and chronic (moderate/severe 28%) GvHD incidences. In summary, Lena can be safely added to Aza/DLI without excess of GvHD and toxicity. Its significant anti-leukemic activity suggests that this combination is a novel salvage option for post-transplant relapse (clinicaltrials gov.

  {"id":"schulman_treatment_2015","abstract":"Summary\n            The efficacy and safety of dabigatran for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) were demonstrated in two trials. It is unclear if the results pertain to patients with cancer and VTE. Data from two randomised trials comparing dabigatran and warfarin for acute VTE were pooled. Primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE and related death from randomisation to the end of the treatment period. Safety outcomes were major, major and clinically relevant non-major, and any bleeding during the oral-only treatment period. Patients with active cancer (=within 5 years) at baseline or diagnosed during the study were analysed. Compared with 4,772 patients without cancer, recurrent VTE occurred more frequently in 335 patients with cancer at any time (hazard ratio [HR] 3.3; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2.1‚Äì5.3) and more often in 114 with cancer diagnosed during the study compared to 221 with cancer at baseline (HR 2.6; 95 % CI, 1.1‚Äì6.2). There was no significant difference in efficacy between dabigatran and warfarin for cancer at baseline (HR 0.75; 95 % CI, 0.20‚Äì2.8) or diagnosed during the study (HR 0.63; 95 % CI, 0.20‚Äì2.0). Major bleeding (HR 4.1; 95 % CI, 2.2‚Äì7.5) and any bleeding (HR 1.5; 95 % CI, 1.2‚Äì2.0) were more frequent in patients with cancer than without, but with similar incidence in cancer with dabigatran or warfarin. In conclusion, in cancer patients, dabigatran provided similar clinical benefit as warfarin. VTE recurrence or bleeding were similar in patients on dabigatran or warfarin. The efficacy of dabigatran has not been assessed in comparison with low-molecular-weight heparin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Schulman","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Goldhaber","given":"Samuel Z."},{"family":"Kearon","given":"Clive"},{"family":"Kakkar","given":"Ajay K."},{"family":"Schellong","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Hantel","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Feuring","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Kreuzer","given":"J√∂rg"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"schulman_treatment_2015","container-title":"Thrombosis and Haemostasis","container-title-short":"Thromb Haemost","DOI":"10.1160/TH14-11-0977","ISSN":"0340-6245, 2567-689X","issue":"07","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"150-157","source":"6.681","title":"Treatment with dabigatran or warfarin in patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1160/TH14-11-0977","volume":"114"},

  {"id":"scott_myeloablative_2017","abstract":"Purpose The optimal regimen intensity before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. We hypothesized that lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) would result in improved overall survival (OS) compared with myeloablative conditioning (MAC). To test this hypothesis, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing MAC with RIC in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients and Methods Patients age 18 to 65 years with HCT comorbidity index # 4 and , 5% marrow myeloblasts pre-HCT were randomly assigned to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137) followed by HCT from HLAmatched related or unrelated donors. The primary end point was OS 18 months post‚Äìrandom assignment based on an intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary end points included relapse-free survival (RFS) and TRM.\nResults Planned enrollment was 356 patients; accrual ceased at 272 because of high relapse incidence with RIC versus MAC (48.3%; 95% CI, 39.6% to 56.4% and 13.5%; 95% CI, 8.3% to 19.8%, respectively; P , .001). At 18 months, OS for patients in the RIC arm was 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1% to 74.9%) versus 77.5% (95% CI, 69.4% to 83.7%) for those in the MAC arm (difference, 9.8%; 95% CI, 20.8% to 20.3%; P = .07). TRM with RIC was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.8% to 8.9%) versus 15.8% (95% CI, 10.2% to 22.5%) with MAC (P = .002). RFS with RIC was 47.3% (95% CI, 38.7% to 55.4%) versus 67.8% (95% CI, 59.1% to 75%) with MAC (P , .01).\nConclusion OS was higher with MAC, but this was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. RIC resulted in lower TRM but higher relapse rates compared with MAC, with a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant advantage in RFS with MAC. These data support the use of MAC as the standard of care for Ô¨Åt patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"Bart L."},{"family":"Pasquini","given":"Marcelo C."},{"family":"Logan","given":"Brent R."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Devine","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Porter","given":"David L."},{"family":"Maziarz","given":"Richard T."},{"family":"Warlick","given":"Erica D."},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Hugo F."},{"family":"Alyea","given":"Edwin P."},{"family":"Hamadani","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Bashey","given":"Asad"},{"family":"Giralt","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Geller","given":"Nancy L."},{"family":"Leifer","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Le-Rademacher","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Mendizabal","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Horowitz","given":"Mary M."},{"family":"Deeg","given":"H.

Patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy (intravenous fludarabine 30 mg/m2 and intravenous cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) followed 2-7 days later by two sequential lisocabtagene maraleucel infusions (equal target doses of CD8+ and CD4+ CAR+ T cells for a total target dose of 100‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ106 CAR+ T cells). The primary endpoint was the overall response rate and was assessed in all patients who received lisocabtagene maraleucel and had confirmed PET-positive disease before lisocabtagene maraleucel administration based on an independent review committee according to the Lugano 2014 criteria.

  {"id":"sehn_diffuse_2014","abstract":"Although the majority of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be cured with standard rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), patients who fail R-CHOP have a dismal outcome. Thus, optimization of front-line therapy, as well as the development of more effective salvage strategies, remains an important objective. Advances in molecular genetics have vastly improved our understanding of the biological diversity of DLBCL and have led to the discovery of key oncogenic pathways. In addition to the major molecular designations of germinal center B-cell and activated B-cell subtypes, next-generation sequencing technologies have unveiled the remarkable complexity of DLBCL and identified unique molecular targets that may be differentially exploited for therapeutic benefit. These findings have translated into a growing list of promising novel agents. Moving forward, it is of paramount importance to recognize the heterogeneity of DLBCL and to investigate these targeted agents within patient populations who are most likely to benefit. It will be necessary to prioritize drugs that affect key driver pathways and to combine them rationally to optimize their benefit. Improved prognostication and the availability of predictive biomarkers will be crucial to allow for the possibility of individualized risk-adapted therapy.","author":[{"family":"Sehn","given":"Laurie H."},{"family":"Gascoyne","given":"Randy D."}],"citation-key":"sehn_diffuse_2014","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2014-05-577189","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"22-32","title":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: optimizing outcome in the context of clinical and biologic heterogeneity.","type":"article-journal","volume":"125"},

  {"id":"semple_transfusionassociated_2019","abstract":"Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) are syndromes of acute respiratory distress that occur within 6 hours of blood transfusion. TACO and TRALI are the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities, and specific therapies are unavailable. Diagnostically, it remains very challenging to distinguish TACO and TRALI from underlying causes of lung injury and/or fluid overload as well as from each other. TACO is characterized by pulmonary hydrostatic (cardiogenic) edema, whereas TRALI presents as pulmonary permeability edema (noncardiogenic). The pathophysiology of both syndromes is complex and incompletely understood. A 2-hit model is generally assumed to underlie TACO and TRALI disease pathology, where the first hit represents the clinical condition of the patient and the second hit is conveyed by the transfusion product. In TACO, cardiac or renal impairment and positive fluid balance appear first hits, whereas suboptimal fluid management or other components in the transfused product may enable the second hit. Remarkably, other factors beyond volume play a role in TACO. In TRALI, the first hit can, for example, be represented by inflammation, whereas the second hit is assumed to be caused by antileukocyte antibodies or biological response modifiers (eg, lipids). In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of TACO and TRALI regarding clinical definitions, diagnostic strategies, pathophysiological mechanisms, and potential therapies. More research is required to better understand TACO and TRALI pathophysiology, and more biomarker studies are warranted. Collectively, this may result in improved diagnostics and development of therapeutic approaches for these life-threatening transfusion reactions.","author":[{"family":"Semple","given":"John W."},{"family":"Rebetz","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Kapur","given":"Rick"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"semple_transfusionassociated_2019","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2018-10-860809","ISSN":"1528-0020","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1840-1853","PMID":"30808638","source":"25.476","title":"Transfusion-associated circulatory overload and transfusion-related acute lung injury","type":"article-journal","volume":"133"},
  {"id":"senapati_management_2023","abstract":"With the improving knowledge of CML and its management, the goals of therapy need to be revisited to ensure an optimal use of the BCR::ABL1 TKIs in the frontline and later-line therapy of CML. In the frontline therapy of CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP), imatinib and the three second-generation TKIs (bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib) are associated with comparable survival results. The second-generation TKIs may produce earlier deep molecular responses, hence reducing the time to reaching a treatment-free remission (TFR). The choice of the second-generation TKI versus imatinib in frontline therapy is based on the treatment aims (survival, TFR), the CML risk, the drug cost, and the toxicity profile with respect to the patient‚Äôs comorbidities. The TKI dosing is more flexible than has been described in the registration trials, and dose adjustments can be considered both in the frontline and later-line settings (e.g., dasatinib 50‚Äâmg frontline therapy; dose adjusted schedules of bosutinib and ponatinib), as well as during an ongoing TKI therapy to manage toxicities, before considering changing the TKI. In patients who are not candidates for TFR, BCR::ABL1 (International Scale) transcripts levels <1% are acceptable, result in virtually similar survival as with deeper molecular remissions, and need not warrant a change of TKI. For patients with true resistance to second-generation TKIs or with the T315I gatekeeper mutation, the third-generation TKIs are preferred. Ponatinib should be considered first because of the cumulative experience and results in the CML subsets, including in T315I-mutated CML. A response-based dosing of ponatinib is safe and leads to high TKI compliance. Asciminib is a third-generation TKI with possibly a better toxicity profile, but lesser activity in T315I-mutated CML. Olverembatinib is another potent third-generation TKI with early promising results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Senapati","given":"Jayastu"},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Issa","given":"Ghayas C."},{"family":"Lipton","given":"Jeffrey H."},{"family":"Radich","given":"Jerald P."},{"family":"Jabbour","given":"Elias"},{"family":"Kantarjian","given":"Hagop M."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"senapati_management_2023","container-title":"Blood Cancer Journal","container-title-short":"Blood Cancer J.","DOI":"10.1038/s41408-023-00823-9","ISSN":"2044-5385","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-12","PMCID":"PMC10123066","PMID":"37088793","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"9.812","title":"Management of chronic myeloid leukemia in 2023 ‚Äì common ground and common sense","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-023-00823-9","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"sequist_genotypic_2011","abstract":"Lung cancers harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but drug resistance invariably emerges. To elucidate mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we performed systematic genetic and histological analyses of tumor biopsies from 37 patients with drug-resistant nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) carrying EGFR mutations. All drug-resistant tumors retained their original activating EGFR mutations, and some acquired known mechanisms of resistance including the EGFR T790M mutation or MET gene amplification. Some resistant cancers showed unexpected genetic changes including EGFR amplification and mutations in the PIK3CA gene, whereas others underwent a pronounced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Surprisingly, five resistant tumors (14%) transformed from NSCLC into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and were sensitive to standard SCLC treatments. In three patients, serial biopsies revealed that genetic mechanisms of resistance were lost in the absence of the continued selective pressure of EGFR inhibitor treatment, and such cancers were sensitive to a second round of treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of resistance to EGFR inhibitors and underscore the importance of repeatedly assessing cancers throughout the course of the disease.","author":[{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Waltman","given":"Belinda A."},{"family":"Dias-Santagata","given":"Dora"},{"family":"Digumarthy","given":"Subba R."},{"family":"Turke","given":"Alexa B."},{"family":"Fidias","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Bergethon","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Alice T."},{"family":"Gettinger","given":"Scott N."},{"family":"Cosper","given":"Arjola K."},{"family":"Akhavanfard","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Heist","given":"Rebecca S."},{"family":"Temel","given":"Jennifer S."},{"family":"Christensen","given":"James G."},{"family":"Wain","given":"John C."},{"family":"Lynch","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Vernovsky","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Mark","given":"Eugene J."},{"family":"Lanuti","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Iafrate","given":"A.

  {"id":"seymour_different_2007","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In the non-curative setting, the sequence in which anticancer agents are used, singly or in combination, may be important if patients are to receive the maximum period of disease control with the minimum of adverse effects. We compared sequential and combination chemotherapy strategies in patients with unpretreated advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, who were regarded as not potentially curable irrespective of response.\nMETHODS: We studied patients with advanced colorectal cancer, starting treatment with non-curative intent. 2135 unpretreated patients were randomly assigned to three treatment strategies in the ratio 1:1:1. Strategy A (control group) was single-agent fluorouracil (given with levofolinate over 48 h every 2 weeks) until failure, then single-agent irinotecan. Strategy B was fluorouracil until failure, then combination chemotherapy. Strategy C was combination chemotherapy from the outset. Within strategies B and C, patients were randomly assigned to receive, as the combination regimen, fluorouracil plus irinotecan (groups B-ir and C-ir) or fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (groups B-ox and C-ox). The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 79877428.\nRESULTS: Median survival of patients allocated to control strategy A was 13.9 months. Median survival of each of the other groups was longer (B-ir 15.0, B-ox 15.2, C-ir 16.7, and C-ox 15.4 months). However, log-rank comparison of each group against control showed that only C-ir--the first-line combination strategy including irinotecan--satisfied the statistical test for superiority (p=0.01). Overall comparison of strategy B with strategy C was within the predetermined non-inferiority boundary of HR=1.18 or less (HR=1.06, 90% CI 0.97-1.17).\nINTERPRETATION: Our data challenge the assumption that, in this non-curative setting, maximum tolerable treatment must necessarily be used first-line. The staged approach of initial single-agent treatment upgraded to combination when required is not worse than first-line combination, and is an alternative option for discussion with patients.","author":[{"family":"Seymour","given":"Matthew T."},{"family":"Maughan","given":"Timothy S."},{"family":"Ledermann","given":"Jonathan A."},{"family":"Topham","given":"Clare"},{"family":"James","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Gwyther","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Smith","given":"David B."},{"family":"Shepherd","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Maraveyas","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Ferry","given":"David R."},{"family":"Meade","given":"Angela M."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Lindsay"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Gareth O."},{"family":"Parmar","given":"Mahesh Kb"},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"FOCUS Trial Investigators","given":""},{"family":"National Cancer Research Institute Colorectal Clinical Studies Group","given":""}],"citation-key":"seymour_different_2007","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61087-3","ISSN":"1474-547X","issue":"9582","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",7,14]]},"language":"eng","page":"143-152","PMID":"17630037","source":"PubMed","title":"Different strategies of sequential and combination chemotherapy for patients with poor prognosis advanced colorectal cancer (MRC FOCUS): a randomised controlled trial","title-short":"Different strategies of sequential and combination chemotherapy for patients with poor prognosis advanced colorectal cancer (MRC FOCUS)","type":"article-journal","volume":"370"},

The epidemiology of squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus has diverged over the past several decades, with a marked increase in incidence only for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Only in the past decade, however, have molecular features that distinguish these two forms of the disease been identified. This advance has the potential to improve screening for oesophageal cancers through the development of novel minimally invasive diagnostic technologies predicated on cancer-specific genomic or epigenetic alterations. Surgical techniques have also evolved towards less invasive approaches associated with less morbidity, without compromising oncological outcomes. With improvements in multidisciplinary care, advances in radiotherapy and new tools to detect minimal residual disease, certain patients may no longer even require surgical tumour resection. However, perhaps the most anticipated advance in the treatment of patients with oesophageal cancer is the advent of immune-checkpoint inhibitors, which harness and enhance the host immune response against cancer.

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of alectinib in patients with ALK -positive NSCLC who progressed on previous crizotinib. Methods We did a phase 2 study at 27 centres in the USA and Canada. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with stage IIIBÔøΩ®ßªV, ALK -positive NSCLC who had progressed after crizotinib. Patients were treated with oral alectinib 600 mg twice daily until progression, death, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response by an independent review committee using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Response endpoints were assessed in the response-evaluable population (ie, patients with measurable disease at baseline who received at least one dose of study drug), and efficacy and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population (all enrolled patients). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01871805. The study is ongoing and patients are still receiving treatment. Findings Between Sept 4, 2013, and Aug 4, 2014, 87 patients were enrolled into the study (intention-to-treat population). At the time of the primary analysis (median follow-up 4Áπö8 months [IQR 3Áπö3ÔøΩÔøΩ7Áπö1]), 33 of 69 patients with measurable disease at baseline had a confirmed partial response; thus, the proportion of patients achieving an objective response by the independent review committee was 48% (95% CI 36ÔøΩÔøΩ60). Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2, most commonly constipation (31 [36%]), fatigue (29 [33%]), myalgia 21 [24%]), and peripheral oedema 20 [23%]). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were changes in laboratory values, including increased blood creatine phosphokinase (seven [8%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (five [6%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (four [5%]). Two patients died: one had a haemorrhage (judged related to study treatment), and one had disease progression and a history of stroke (judged unrelated to treatment). Interpretation Alectinib showed clinical activity and was well tolerated in patients with ALK -positive NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib. Therefore, alectinib could be a suitable treatment for patients with ALK -positive disease who have progressed on crizotinib.

  {"id":"shaw_crizotinib_2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In single-group studies, chromosomal rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK ) have been associated with marked clinical responses to crizotinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting ALK. Whether crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy with respect to efficacy is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, open-label trial comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy in 347 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive lung cancer who had received one prior platinum-based regimen. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment with crizotinib (250 mg) twice daily or intravenous chemotherapy with either pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or docetaxel (75 mg per square meter) every 3 weeks. Patients in the chemotherapy group who had disease progression were permitted to cross over to crizotinib as part of a separate study. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 7.7 months in the crizotinib group and 3.0 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). The response rates were 65% (95% CI, 58 to 72) with crizotinib, as compared with 20% (95% CI, 14 to 26) with chemotherapy (P<0.001). An interim analysis of overall survival showed no significant improvement with crizotinib as compared with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for death in the crizotinib group, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.54; P=0.54). Common adverse events associated with crizotinib were visual disorder, gastrointestinal side effects, and elevated liver aminotransferase levels, whereas common adverse events with chemotherapy were fatigue, alopecia, and dyspnea. Patients reported greater reductions in symptoms of lung cancer and greater improvement in global quality of life with crizotinib than with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in patients with previously treated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement.

  {"id":"shaw_lorlatinib_2017","abstract":"Summary Background Most patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK )-rearranged or ROS proto-oncogene 1 ( ROS1 )-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, but resistance invariably develops, commonly within the CNS. This study aimed to analyse the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of lorlatinib, a novel, highly potent, selective, and brain-penetrant ALK and ROS1 TKI with preclinical activity against most known resistance mutations, in patients with advanced ALK -positive or ROS1 -positive NSCLC. Methods In this international multicentre, open-label, single-arm, first-in-man phase 1 dose-escalation study, eligible patients had advanced ALK -positive or ROS1 -positive NSCLC and were older than 18 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate end-organ function. Lorlatinib was administered orally to patients at doses ranging from 10 mg to 200 mg once daily or 35 mg to 100 mg twice daily, with a minimum of three patients receiving each dose. For some patients, tumour biopsy was done before lorlatinib treatment to identify ALK resistance mutations. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of lorlatinib; efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population (patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had either ALK or ROS1 rearrangement). The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities during cycle 1 according to investigator assessment; secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, and overall response. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01970865. Findings Between Jan 22, 2014, and July 10, 2015, 54 patients received at least one dose of lorlatinib, including 41 (77%) with ALK -positive and 12 (23%) with ROS1 -positive NSCLC; one patient had unconfirmed ALK and ROS1 status. 28 (52%) patients had received two or more TKIs, and 39 (72%) patients had CNS metastases. The most common treatment-related adverse events among the 54 patients were hypercholesterolaemia (39 [72%] of 54 patients), hypertriglyceridaemia (21 [39%] of 54 patients), peripheral neuropathy (21 [39%] of 54 patients), and peripheral oedema (21 [39%] of 54 patients). One dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 200 mg (the patient did not take at least 16 of 21 prescribed total daily doses in cycle 1 because of toxicities attributable to study drug, which were grade 2 neurocognitive adverse events comprising slowed speech and mentation and word-finding difficulty). No maximum tolerated dose was identified. The recommended phase 2 dose was selected as 100 mg once daily. For ALK -positive patients, the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 19 (46%) of 41 patients (95% CI 31ÔøΩÔøΩ63); for those who had received two or more TKIs, the proportion of patients with an objective response was 11 (42%) of 26 patients (23ÔøΩÔøΩ63). In ROS1 -positive patients, including seven crizotinib-pretreated patients, an objective response was achieved by six (50%) of 12 patients (95% CI 21ÔøΩÔøΩ79). Interpretation In this phase 1, dose-escalation study, lorlatinib showed both systemic and intracranial activity in patients with advanced ALK -positive or ROS1 -positive NSCLC, most of whom had CNS metastases and had previously had two or more TKI treatments fail. Therefore, lorlatinib might be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with ALK -positive NSCLC who have become resistant to currently available TKIs, including second-generation ALK TKIs, and is being investigated in a phase 3 randomised controlled trial comparing lorlatinib to crizotinib (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03052608).

  {"id":"shaw_resensitization_2015","abstract":"In a patient who had metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung cancer, resistance to crizotinib developed because of a mutation in the ALK kinase domain. This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond to lorlatinib (PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance to lorlatinib through steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib.

  {"id":"shen_effect_2020","abstract":"Importance A randomized clinical trial is needed to determine whether the second-generation AblÔøΩÊáÄyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is more effective than the first-generation inhibitor imatinib mesylate for childhood Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Objective To determine whether dasatinib given at a daily dosage of 80 mg/m2is more effective than imatinib mesylate at a daily dosage of 300 mg/m2to improve event-free survival of children with Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive ALL in the context of intensive chemotherapy without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Design, Setting, and Participants This open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted at 20 hospitals in China. Enrollment occurred from January 1, 2015, through September 18, 2018, and randomization was stopped on October 4, 2018, when the early stopping criterion of the trial was met. Patients aged 0 to 18 years were recruited. Of the 225 patients with the diagnosis, 35 declined participation and 1 died before treatment, leaving 189 patients available for analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1 through August 4, 2019. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive daily dasatinib (nÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ92) or imatinib (nÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ97) continuously for the entire duration of ALL therapy from the time of diagnosis made during remission induction to the end of continuation therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was event-free survival, analyzed based on intention to treat. The secondary outcomes were relapse, death due to toxic effects, and overall survival. Results Among the 189 participants (136 male [72.0%]; median age, 7.8 [interquartile range (IQR), 5.2-11.3] years) and a median follow-up of 26.4 (IQR, 16.3-34.1) months, the 4-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 71.0% (95% CI, 56.2%-89.6%) and 88.4% (95% CI, 81.3%-96.1%), respectively, in the dasatinib group and 48.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-74.5%;PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.005, log-rank test) and 69.2% (95% CI, 55.6%-86.2%;PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.04, log-rank test), respectively, in the imatinib group. The 4-year cumulative risk of any relapse was 19.8% (95% CI, 4.2%-35.4%) in the dasatinib group and 34.4% (95% CI, 15.6%-53.2%) in the imatinib group (PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.01, Gray test), whereas the 4-year cumulative risk of an isolated central nervous system relapse was 2.7% (95% CI, 0.0%-8.1%) in the dasatinib group and 8.4% (95% CI, 1.2%-15.6%) in the imatinib group (PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.06, Gray test). There were no significant differences in the frequency of severe toxic effects between the 2 treatment groups. Conclusions and Relevance Intensive chemotherapy including dasatinib at a dosage of 80 mg/m2per day yielded superior results in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive ALL compared with imatinib mesylate at a dosage of 300 mg/m2per day and provided excellent control of central nervous system leukemia without the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation.

  {"id":"shi_dept_2023","abstract":"Prompt tuning (PT), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous) prompt vectors is affixed to the input of language models (LM), has shown promising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences, which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to the Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue, we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then optimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better performance while saving over 20% memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT and its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through extensive experiments on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language (VL) tasks, we demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches, including the full fine-tuning baseline in some scenarios. Additionally, we empirically show that DEPT grows more efficient as the model size increases. Our further study reveals that DePT integrates seamlessly with parameter-efficient transfer learning in the few-shot learning setting and highlights its adaptability to various model architectures and sizes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Zhengxiang"},{"family":"Lipani","given":"Aldo"}],"citation-key":"shi_dept_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2309.05173","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"number":"arXiv:2309.05173","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"DePT: Decomposed Prompt Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning","title-short":"DePT","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05173"},

  {"id":"shih_origin_2021","abstract":"Unlike other human cancers, in which all primary tumors arise de novo, ovarian epithelial cancers are primarily imported from either endometrial or fallopian tube epithelium. The prevailing paradigm in the genesis of high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most common ovarian cancer, posits to its development in fallopian tubes through stepwise tumor progression. Recent progress has been made not only in gathering terabytes of omics data but also in detailing the histologic‚Äìmolecular correlations required for looking into, and making sense of, the tissue origin of HGSC. This emerging paradigm is changing many facets of ovarian cancer research and routine gynecology practice. The precancerous landscape in fallopian tubes contains multiple concurrent precursor lesions, including serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), with genetic heterogeneity providing a platform for HGSC evolution. Mathematical models imply that a prolonged time (decades) elapses from the development of a TP53 mutation, the earliest known molecular alteration, to an STIC, followed by a shorter span (6 years) for progression to an HGSC. Genetic predisposition accelerates the trajectory. This timeline may allow for the early diagnosis of HGSC and STIC, followed by intent-to-cure surgery. This review discusses the recent advances in this tubal paradigm and its biological and clinical implications, alongside the promise and challenge of studying STIC and other precancerous lesions of HGSC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Shih","given":"Ie-Ming"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yeh"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tian-Li"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"shih_origin_2021","container-title":"The American Journal of Pathology","container-title-short":"The American Journal of Pathology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.09.006","ISSN":"0002-9440","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"26-39","PMCID":"PMC7786078","PMID":"33011111","source":"5.77","title":"The Origin of Ovarian Cancer Species and Precancerous Landscape","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944020304491","volume":"191"},

When individual ACAs were evaluated, +der(22)t(9;22) and/or -9/9p in the absence of high hyperdiploidy (HeH) was present in 16% of patients and constituted a poor-risk ACA group. Patients with 1 or more poor-risk ACA in the absence of HeH had significantly shorter RFS (5-year RFS rate 33% versus 59%, P=0.01) and OS (5-year OS rate 24% versus 63%, P=0.003). Poor-risk ACAs were prognostic in patients who received imatinib and dasatinib but not in those who received ponatinib. By multivariate analysis, this poor-risk ACA group was independently associated with worse RFS (HR 2.03 [95% CI 1.08-3.30], P=0.03) and OS (HR 2.02 [95% CI 1.10-3.71], P=0.02). Patients with Ph+ ALL who have +der(22)t(9;22) and/or -9/9p in the absence of HeH have relatively poor outcomes when treated with chemotherapy plus a TKI. This article is protected by copyright.

  {"id":"short_s114_2022","abstract":"Background: Ponatinib and blinatumomab are both highly effective therapies for Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The combination of these two agents may offer an effective chemotherapy-free strategy in these patients (pts). Aims: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ponatinib and blinatumomab in pts with newly diagnosed (ND), relapsed/refractory (R/R) Ph+ ALL or CML in lymphoid blast phase (CML-LBP). For pts with ND Ph+ ALL, the primary endpoint was the complete molecular response (CMR) rate. For pts with R/R Ph+ ALL, the primary endpoint was the CR/CRi rate. Secondary endpoints included safety, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods: In this phase II study, adults with ND Ph+ ALL, R/R Ph+ ALL, or CML-LBP were eligible. Pts were required to have a performance status of ÔøΩÔøΩ2, total bilirubin ÔøΩÔøΩ2x the upper limit of normal (ULN), and ALT and AST ÔøΩÔøΩ3x the ULN. Pts with uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or clinically significant central nervous system (CNS) comorbidities (except for CNS leukemia) were excluded. Pts received up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab as a continuous infusion at standard doses. Ponatinib 30mg daily was given during cycle 1 and was decreased to 15mg daily once CMR was achieved. After 5 cycles of blinatumomab, ponatinib was continued for at least 5 years. Twelve doses of prophylactic IT chemotherapy with alternating cytarabine and methotrexate were administered. Results: Between 2/2018 to 1/2022, 55 pts were treated (35 with ND Ph+ ALL, 14 with R/R Ph+ ALL and 6 with CML-LBP). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Among the 35 pts with ND Ph+ ALL, 12 were in CR at enrollment (including 2 pts in CMR). 22 of the 23 evaluable pts (96%) achieved CR/CRi. One pt died on day 18 from intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of chemotherapy administered prior to enrollment. After one cycle, 21/33 pts (64%) achieved CMR, and 28/33 pts (85%) achieved CMR at any time. 11 of 15 tested pts (73%) also became MRD-negative by an NGS assay with sensitivity of 1x10-6. CR/CRi was achieved in 12/13 (92%) evaluable pts with R/R Ph+ ALL. CMR was achieved in 10 pts (71%) after cycle 1 and in 11 pts (79%) overall. 5 of 6 pts with CML-LBP achieved CR/CRi, and 1 pt achieved PR as best response. 2 pts (40%) achieved CMR. In the ND Ph+ ALL cohort, 1 of 34 pts who received at least 1 full cycle died in CR; the other 33 are in ongoing hematologic remission. Only one pt underwent stem cell transplant (SCT) in first remission for persistently detectable BCR/ABL1 transcripts. Among 13 responding pts in the R/R Ph+ ALL cohort, 6 proceeded to SCT, 4 did not undergo SCT and subsequently relapsed, 1 died in CR, and 2 are in ongoing remission without SCT. In the CML-LBP cohort, 3 of the 5 responding pts subsequently relapsed. The median follow-up is 11 months (range, 1-46+). For ND Ph+ ALL, the 2-year EFS and OS are both 93% (Figure 2). There were no relapses or leukemia-related deaths in this cohort. In the R/R Ph+ ALL cohort, the 2-year EFS rate was 42% and the 2-year OS rate was 61%. In the CML-LBP cohort, the 2-year EFS was 33% and the 2-year OS was 60%. The treatment was well-tolerated, and most toxicities were grade 1-2 and consistent with the known toxicities of the two agents. Two pts discontinued ponatinib due to toxicity (1 due to stroke and 1 due to DVT). One pt discontinued blinatumomab due to persistent grade 2 tremor. Image:Summary/Conclusion: The chemotherapy-free regimen of simultaneous ponatinib and blinatumomab is safe and effective in pts with Ph+ ALL. For pts with ND Ph+ ALL, SCT does not appear to be needed in first remission.","author":[{"family":"Short","given":"N."},{"family":"Kantarjian","given":"H."},{"family":"Konopleva","given":"M."},{"family":"Jain","given":"N."},{"family":"Ravandi","given":"F."},{"family":"Huang","given":"X."},{"family":"Macaron","given":"W."},{"family":"Wierda","given":"W."},{"family":"Borthakur","given":"G."},{"family":"Kadia","given":"T."},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"K."},{"family":"Issa","given":"G."},{"family":"Montalban-Bravo","given":"G."},{"family":"Alvarado","given":"Y."},{"family":"Garcia-Manero","given":"G."},{"family":"Dinardo","given":"C."},{"family":"Thankachan","given":"J."},{"family":"Delumpa","given":"R."},{"family":"Mayor","given":"E."},{"family":"Deen","given":"W."},{"family":"Milton","given":"A."},{"family":"Rivera","given":"J."},{"family":"Waller","given":"L."},{"family":"Loiselle","given":"C."},{"family":"Garris","given":"R."},{"family":"Jabbour","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"short_s114_2022","container-title":"HemaSphere","container-title-short":"HemaSphere","DOI":"10.1097/01.hs9.0000843352.55138.40","issue":"NA","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"15-16","title":"S114: ponatinib and blinatumomab for patients with philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: updated results from a phase ii study","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"siegel_cancer_2022","abstract":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes. Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.","author":[{"family":"Siegel","given":"Rebecca L"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Kimberly D"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Hannah E"},{"family":"Jemal","given":"Ahmedin"}],"citation-key":"siegel_cancer_2022","container-title":"CA: a cancer journal for clinicians","container-title-short":"CA.

  {"id":"simoni_bystander_2018","abstract":"Various forms of immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, are proving to be effective at restoring T cell-mediated immune responses that can lead to marked and sustained clinical responses, but only in some patients and cancer types1‚Äì4. Patients and tumours may respond unpredictably to immunotherapy partly owing to heterogeneity of the immune composition and phenotypic profiles of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within individual tumours and between patients5,6. Although there is evidence that tumour-mutation-derived neoantigen-specific T cells play a role in tumour control2,4,7‚Äì10, in most cases the antigen specificities of phenotypically diverse tumour-infiltrating T cells are largely unknown. Here we show that human lung and colorectal cancer CD8+ TILs can¬†not only be specific for tumour antigens (for example, neoantigens), but also recognize a wide range of epitopes unrelated to cancer (such as those from Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus, human cytomegalovirus or influenza virus). We found that these bystander CD8+ TILs have diverse phenotypes that overlap with tumour-specific cells, but lack CD39 expression. In colorectal and lung tumours, the absence of CD39 in CD8+ TILs defines populations that lack hallmarks of chronic antigen stimulation at the tumour site, supporting their classification as bystanders. Expression of CD39 varied markedly between patients, with some patients having predominantly CD39‚àí CD8+ TILs. Furthermore, frequencies of CD39 expression among CD8+ TILs correlated with several important clinical parameters, such as the mutation status of¬†lung tumour epidermal growth factor receptors. Our results demonstrate that not all tumour-infiltrating T cells are specific for tumour antigens, and suggest that measuring CD39 expression could be a straightforward way to quantify or isolate bystander T cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Simoni","given":"Yannick"},{"family":"Becht","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Fehlings","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Loh","given":"Chiew Yee"},{"family":"Koo","given":"Si-Lin"},{"family":"Teng","given":"Karen Wei Weng"},{"family":"Yeong","given":"Joe Poh Sheng"},{"family":"Nahar","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tong"},{"family":"Kared","given":"Hassen"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Kaibo"},{"family":"Ang","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Poidinger","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yin Yeng"},{"family":"Larbi","given":"Anis"},{"family":"Khng","given":"Alexis J."},{"family":"Tan","given":"Emile"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Cherylin"},{"family":"Mathew","given":"Ronnie"},{"family":"Teo","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Wan Teck"},{"family":"Toh","given":"Chee Keong"},{"family":"Ong","given":"Boon-Hean"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Hillmer","given":"Axel M."},{"family":"Takano","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Tony Kiat Hon"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Eng Huat"},{"family":"Zhai","given":"Weiwei"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Daniel S.

  {"id":"singh_emt_2010","abstract":"Tumors are cellularly and molecularly heterogeneous, with subsets of undifferentiated cancer cells exhibiting stem cell-like features (CSCs). Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) are transdifferentiation programs that are required for tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. The EMT process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-Â∏£, whose activities are dysregulated during malignant tumor progression. Thus, EMT induction in cancer cells results in the acquisition of invasive and metastatic properties. Recent reports indicate that the emergence of CSCs occurs in part as a result of EMT, for example, through cues from tumor stromal components. Recent evidence now indicates that EMT of tumor cells not only causes increased metastasis, but also contributes to drug resistance. In this review, we will provide potential mechanistic explanations for the association between EMT induction and the emergence of CSCs. We will also highlight recent studies implicating the function of TGF-Â∏£-regulated noncoding RNAs in driving EMT and promoting CSC self-renewal. Finally we will discuss how EMT and CSCs may contribute to drug resistance, as well as therapeutic strategies to overcome this clinically.","author":[{"family":"Singh","given":"Anurag K."},{"family":"Settleman","given":"Jeffrey"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"singh_emt_2010","container-title":"Oncogene","DOI":"10.1038/onc.2010.215","issue":"34","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"4741-4751","source":"8","title":"EMT, cancer stem cells and drug resistance: an emerging axis of evil in the war on cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"singh_systematic_2014","abstract":"Methods: A comprehensive search of four major databases (EMBASE, OVID Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar) was performed from their inception to Ô¨Årst week of Jan 2014. We included original research studies, recruiting ‚â•5 participants, with ‚â•3 months follow-up, published in English language that reported data on recurrence in patients with TTC.\nResults: Out of 298 studies searched, 31 cohorts (1664 TTC patients) were included in the analyses. Out of 74 cases of recurrence, with a mean follow-up of 24.5 months (95% CI, 19.3 to 33 months), extensive recurrence data were available for 23 cases. Cumulative incidence of recurrence was approximately 5% at 6 years. Annual rate of recurrence was approximately 1.5%. Furthermore, 14% of cases had recurrent chest pain and 11% reported dyspnea without deÔ¨Ånite evidence of recurrent TTC. Discharge medications at index admission included Œ≤-adrenoceptor antagonists (BB) in 66.8% and ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and ARB in 67.4%. Recurrence rate was independent of clinic utilization of BB prescription, but inversely correlated (r = ‚àí0.45, p = 0.016) with ACEi/ARB prescription. Patients with severe TTC at index admission were noted to have more recurrences.\nConclusions: (1) TTC is associated with only 1‚Äì2% annual recurrence rate but substantially greater frequency of ongoing symptoms. (2) ACEi/ARB rather than BB may reduce risk of recurrence. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  {"id":"singhal_expertlevel_2023","abstract":"Recent artificial intelligence (AI) systems have reached milestones in \"grand challenges\" ranging from Go to protein-folding. The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; Med-PaLM was the first model to exceed a \"passing\" score in US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) style questions with a score of 67.2% on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base LLM improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement approach. Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU clinical topics datasets. We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p < 0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-PaLM on every evaluation axis (p < 0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form \"adversarial\" questions to probe LLM limitations. While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Singhal","given":"Karan"},{"family":"Tu","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Gottweis","given":"Juraj"},{"family":"Sayres","given":"Rory"},{"family":"Wulczyn","given":"Ellery"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Le"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Pfohl","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Cole-Lewis","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Neal","given":"Darlene"},{"family":"Schaekermann","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Lachgar","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Mansfield","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Prakash","given":"Sushant"},{"family":"Green","given":"Bradley"},{"family":"Dominowska","given":"Ewa"},{"family":"Arcas","given":"Blaise Aguera","dropping-particle":"y"},{"family":"Tomasev","given":"Nenad"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Renee"},{"family":"Semturs","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Mahdavi","given":"S.

  {"id":"singhal_large_2022","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Singhal","given":"Karan"},{"family":"Azizi","given":"Shekoofeh"},{"family":"Tu","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Mahdavi","given":"S.

Since we have configured our AWS instances to serve all of the files produced by the exercises we can load our BAM files by URL. Since the BAM files are indexed, only the information we request to view will be transferred from the AWS instance to our browser for viewing. To load the exome BAMs your URLs should look like these (don‚Äôt forget to substitute your number for #): http://s#.pmbio.org/align/Exome_Norm_sorted_mrkdup_bqsr.bam http://s#.pmbio.org/align/Exome_Tumor_sorted_mrkdup_bqsr.bam Let‚Äôs go through some simple exercises for exploring the Exome BAMs in IGV. Load the exome BAMs If IGV is already running, start a new session with File -> New Session Load the bam files (using the URLs above) with File -> Load from URL Rename the tracks (e.g., Exome Norm Coverage, Exome Norm BAM, Exome Tumor Coverage, Exome Tumor BAM) by right-clicking on each track and selecting Rename Track Save session with File -> Save Session View exome alignments for an example gene For example, let‚Äôs take a look at TP53 on chr17. Simply type TP53 into the search box and hit Go or enter. Notice the coverage peaks roughly centered around each protein-coding exon. Notice that there are several variants. EXERCISE Explore the TP53 sequence and answer the following questions. How many potential variants can you find? Are they SNVs or indels? Are they coding or non-coding? Are the homozygous or heterozygous? Are they germline or somatic? How can you tell? Hint Expand the Gene track to see where TP53 starts. In the collapsed view it appears to be contiguous with WRAP53 due to overlapping transcripts. Hint Zoom into the ~7-8kb region with coding exons (thicker than UTR). Look for colored bars in the coverage track for SNVs and stacks of black gaps (deletions) or purple bars (insertions). Answer There appear to be at least 5 SNVs, 1 insertion and 3 deletions. Two of the SNVs are in coding exons while the rest of the variants are intronic. Note: The 4 indels all look like potential artifacts due to their proximity to homopolymer stretches or repetitive sequences. All of the SNVs appear real and homozygous (or hemizygous). One SNV appears to be somatic. In all cases the VAFs of the SNVs are at or near 100% and one of them is only observed in the tumor. This is one the variants you should have found in TP53. Which one? Now, try viewing the reads as read pairs. How big do your fragments look? Answer The fragment sizes vary. But, estimating by eye, and clicking on a few read pairs to get the insert size, it appears that fragments are in the 200-500bp range Here is a representative region showing reads in paired mode. Considering TP53, what does the average coverage look like? Hint The exons of TP53 have coverage peaks ranging from ~100 to 200X. On average there appears to be ~150X coverage for coding exons. Try loading the .bed file for the exome reagent. Browse your instance for the NimbleGen SeqCap_EZ_Exome_v3 bed file that we downloaded in the Annotation Module. As before, use the File -> Load from URL... option. The URL should look something like (don‚Äôt forget to substitute your number for #): http://s#.pmbio.org/inputs/references/exome/SeqCap_EZ_Exome_v3_hg38_primary_targets.v2.bed How does the coverage pattern compare to the coordinates of targeted regions? Answer As expected, the targeted regions closely overlap the coding exons. Load the WGS BAMs Lets start a new session and load the WGS BAMs, your URLs should look like these: http://s#.pmbio.org/align/WGS_Norm_merged_sorted_mrkdup_bqsr.bam http://s#.pmbio.org/align/WGS_Tumor_merged_sorted_mrkdup_bqsr.bam Using the URLs above: If IGV is already running, start a new session with File -> New Session Load the bam files (using the URLs above) with File -> Load from URL Rename the tracks (e.g., WGS Norm Coverage, WGS Norm BAM, WGS Tumor Coverage, WGS Tumor BAM) by right-clicking on each track and selecting Rename Track Save session with File -> Save Session View WGS alignments for an example gene Once again, let‚Äôs take a look at TP53 on chr17. Simply type TP53 into the search box and hit Go or enter. What does the average WGS coverage look like for Normal and Tumor? How does it differ from the exome coverage pattern? What about the fragment sizes? Answer The WGS Normal sample appears to have average coverage of ~50X whereas the normal has average coverage of ~75X. In general the fragment sizes seem a little larger, with a wider range, from ~250bp to ~600 Color alignments by library or read group by right-clicking on each alignment data track and selecting Color alignments by -> library or Color alignments by -> read group. How many read groups and libraries are there? Answer There were three libraries sequenced across 5 lanes. Lane has been used as read group in this case Explore on your own Spend some time scrolling around and zooming in and out to get a feel for the WGS data. Can you find any regions of low coverage? What are they correlated with? What is different between the variant allele fractions of the normal and tumor? What could explain this?

Guided by the 1996 ASCO clinical outcomes criteria, the Update Committee formulated recommendations based on improvements in survival, quality of life, toxicity reduction and cost-effectiveness.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: The 2005 Update Committee agreed unanimously that reduction in febrile neutropenia (FN) is an important clinical outcome that justifies the use of CSFs, regardless of impact on other factors, when the risk of FN is approximately 20% and no other equally effective regimen that does not require CSFs is available. Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of FN in patients who are at high risk based on age, medical history, disease characteristics, and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen. CSF use allows a modest to moderate increase in dose-density and/or dose-intensity of chemotherapy regimens. Dose-dense regimens should only be used within an appropriately designed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data. Prophylactic CSF for patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma aged 65 years and older treated with curative chemotherapy (CHOP or more aggressive regimens) should be given to reduce the incidence of FN and infections. Current recommendations for the management of patients exposed to lethal doses of total body radiotherapy, but not doses high enough to lead to certain death due to injury to other organs, includes the prompt administration of CSF or pegylated G-CSF.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Khatcheressian","given":"James"},{"family":"Lyman","given":"Gary H."},{"family":"Ozer","given":"Howard"},{"family":"Armitage","given":"James O."},{"family":"Balducci","given":"Lodovico"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Charles L."},{"family":"Cantor","given":"Scott B."},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Cross","given":"Scott J."},{"family":"Demetri","given":"George"},{"family":"Desch","given":"Christopher E."},{"family":"Pizzo","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Schiffer","given":"Charles A."},{"family":"Schwartzberg","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Somerfield","given":"Mark R."},{"family":"Somlo","given":"George"},{"family":"Wade","given":"James C."},{"family":"Wade","given":"James L."},{"family":"Winn","given":"Rodger J."},{"family":"Wozniak","given":"Antoinette J."},{"family":"Wolff","given":"Antonio C."}],"citation-key":"smith_2006_2006","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"smith_focused_2010","abstract":"Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is a limited ultrasound scan performed in the emergency department to assess patients admitted with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT). It is normally undertaken by emergency physicians in order to identify the presence of free Ô¨Çuid, which may represent haemoperitoneum. This potentially allows prompt referral to further imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, and/or surgery. FAST has been adopted worldwide, and most major trauma centres now have access to an ultrasound machine. Despite the popularity of FAST, there remains a lack of clarity and evidence around any actual contribution to patient survival. An ability to evaluate the true impact of FAST is complicated by factors such as the operator dependence of ultrasound, the improved access, speed and subsequent use of CT (which has reduced the value of FAST in some centres), a lack of standardisation around education and the most effective methods to ensure competence, and variations in the practice, quality and audit of FAST. Enthusiasm for FAST is undiminished among emergency physicians, and in general, point of care ultrasound is escalating in a range of areas, including the emergency department. Small portable and hand held ultrasound machines improve the accessibility of FAST and its beneÔ¨Åts are frequently perceived to be an established and essential part of the emergency department service despite its limitations. Since the introduction of FAST, trauma patients are increasingly managed by non-surgical means if haemodynamically stable, and the presence of intraperitoneal Ô¨Çuid does not necessarily inÔ¨Çuence this decision. Recent developments in multi-detector CT, and in the use of contrast enhanced ultrasound, have broadened the management options for trauma patients, and can support a faster diagnostic pathway than was previously possible. FAST is a limited triage tool, whose actual value in the diagnostic and treatment pathway of patients with BAT remains questionable, and more data are needed to justify its use in the light of these recent developments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"J."}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"smith_focused_2010","container-title":"Postgraduate Medical Journal","container-title-short":"Postgraduate Medical Journal","DOI":"10.1136/pgmj.2008.076711","ISSN":"0032-5473","issue":"1015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"285-291","source":"4.973","title":"Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST): should its role be reconsidered?","title-short":"Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pmj.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/pgmj.2008.076711","volume":"86"},

  {"id":"smruthi_amivantamab_2020","abstract":"Small molecule inhibitors targeting mutant EGFR are standard of care in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but acquired resistance invariably develops through mutations in EGFR or through activation of compensatory pathways such as cMet. Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372) is an anti-EGFR and anti-cMet bispecific low fucose antibody with enhanced Fc function designed to treat tumors driven by activated EGFR and/or cMet signaling. Potent in vivo antitumor efficacy is observed upon amivantamab treatment of human tumor xenograft models driven by mutant activated EGFR, and this activity is associated with receptor downregulation. Despite these robust antitumor responses in vivo, limited antiproliferative effects and EGFR/cMet receptor downregulation by amivantamab were observed in vitro Interestingly, in vitro addition of isolated human immune cells notably enhanced amivantamab-mediated EGFR and cMet downregulation, leading to antibody dose-dependent cancer cell killing. Through a comprehensive assessment of the Fc-mediated effector functions, we demonstrate that monocytes and/or macrophages, through trogocytosis, are necessary and sufficient for Fc interaction-mediated EGFR/cMet downmodulation and are required for in vivo antitumor efficacy. Collectively, our findings represent a novel Fc-dependent macrophage-mediated antitumor mechanism of amivantamab and highlight trogocytosis as an important mechanism of action to exploit in designing new antibody-based cancer therapies.","author":[{"family":"Smruthi","given":""},{"family":"Lipfert","given":"Lorraine"},{"family":"Chevalier","given":"Kristen M."},{"family":"Bushey","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Henley","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Lenhart","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Sendecki","given":"Jocelyn"},{"family":"Beqiri","given":"Marilda"},{"family":"Millar","given":"Hillary"},{"family":"Packman","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Lorenzi","given":"Matthew V."},{"family":"Laquerre","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Moores","given":"Sheri Vijayaraghavan"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"smruthi_amivantamab_2020","container-title":"Molecular cancer therapeutics","container-title-short":"Mol.

  {"id":"sobrero_epic_2008","abstract":"PURPOSE: To determine whether adding cetuximab to irinotecan prolongs survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously treated with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter, open-label, phase III study randomly assigned 1,298 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing mCRC who had experienced first-line fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin treatment failure to cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) day 1 followed by 250 mg/m(2) weekly) plus irinotecan (350 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks) or irinotecan alone. Primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and quality of life (QOL).\nRESULTS: Median OS was comparable between treatments: 10.7 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 11.3) with cetuximab/irinotecan and 10.0 months (95% CI, 9.1 to 11.3) with irinotecan alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.975; 95% CI, 0.854 to 1.114; P = .71). This lack of difference may have been due to post-trial therapy: 46.9% of patients assigned to irinotecan eventually received cetuximab (87.2% of those who did, received it with irinotecan). Cetuximab added to irinotecan significantly improved PFS (median, 4.0 v 2.6 months; HR, 0.692; 95% CI, 0.617 to 0.776; P <or= .0001) and RR (16.4% v 4.2%; P < .0001), and resulted in significantly better scores in the QOL analysis of global health status (P = .047). Cetuximab did not exacerbate toxicity, except for acneform rash, diarrhea, hypomagnesemia, and associated electrolyte imbalances. Neutropenia was the most common severe toxicity across treatment arms.\nCONCLUSION: Cetuximab and irinotecan improved PFS and RR, and resulted in better QOL versus irinotecan alone. OS was similar between study groups, possibly influenced by the large number of patients in the irinotecan arm who received cetuximab and irinotecan poststudy.","author":[{"family":"Sobrero","given":"Alberto F."},{"family":"Maurel","given":"Joan"},{"family":"Fehrenbacher","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Scheithauer","given":"Werner"},{"family":"Abubakr","given":"Yousif A."},{"family":"Lutz","given":"Manfred P."},{"family":"Vega-Villegas","given":"M.

This open-label, phase 3 study evaluated atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic nonsquamous nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not previously received chemotherapy. Methods We randomly assigned patients to receive atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ACP), bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (BCP), or atezolizumab plus BCP (ABCP) every 3 weeks for four or six cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with atezolizumab, bevacizumab, or both. The two primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival both among patients in the intention-to-treat population who had a wild-type genotype (WT population; patients with EGFR or ALK genetic alterations were excluded) and among patients in the WT population who had high expression of an effector T-cell (Teff) gene signature in the tumor (Teff-high WT population) and overall survival in the WT population. The ABCP group was compared with the BCP group before the ACP group was compared with the BCP group. Results In the WT population, 356 patients were assigned to the ABCP group, and 336 to the BCP group. The median progression-free survival was longer in the ABCP group than in the BCP group (8.3 months vs. 6.8 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.74; P<0.001); the corresponding values in the Teff-high WT population were 11.3 months and 6.8 months (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.68]; P<0.001). Progression-free survival was also longer in the ABCP group than in the BCP group in the entire intention-to-treat population (including those with EGFR or ALK genetic alterations) and among patients with low or negative programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, those with low Teff gene-signature expression, and those with liver metastases. Median overall survival among the patients in the WT population was longer in the ABCP group than in the BCP group (19.2 months vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.96; P=0.02). The safety profile of ABCP was consistent with previously reported safety risks of the individual medicines. Conclusions The addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival among patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression and EGFR or ALK genetic alteration status.

After randomization, 242 patients were evaluated for efficacy: 119 received CHVP alone, and 123 also received IFNalpha at a dose of 5 million units three times weekly for 18 months.\nRESULTS: After a 6-year median follow-up, the patients treated with CHVP + IFNalpha showed significantly longer median PFS than those who received CHVP alone (2.9 years v 1.5 years, respectively; P = .0002) and significantly longer median OS (not reached v 5.6 years, respectively; P = .008). Although some side effects, which included neutropenia, asthenia, fever, elevated serum transaminase levels, flu-like symptoms, and thrombocytopenia, were more frequently observed in patients who received the combination regimen, these reactions were moderate. IFNalpha was withdrawn because of toxicity in 10% of the patients, and a dosage reduction or temporary suspension was required in 28%.\nCONCLUSION: With long-term follow-up of 6 years, these results confirm that the addition of IFNalpha to a doxorubicin-containing regimen for patients with advanced-stage and clinically aggressive FL not only increased PFS, as in most other similar trials, but also prolonged OS. Toxicity was moderate. The beneficial effects of this combined chemotherapy and IFNalpha regimen on OS probably reflect the selection of FL patients with poor prognostic factors.","author":[{"family":"Solal-C√©ligny","given":"P."},{"family":"Lepage","given":"E."},{"family":"Brousse","given":"N."},{"family":"Tendler","given":"C.

  {"id":"solomon_firstline_2014","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of the ALK inhibitor crizotinib as compared with standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 3 trial comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy in 343 patients with advanced ALK-positive nonsquamous NSCLC who had received no previous systemic treatment for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral crizotinib at a dose of 250 mg twice daily or to receive intravenous chemotherapy (pemetrexed, 500 mg per square meter of body-surface area, plus either cisplatin, 75 mg per square meter, or carboplatin, target area under the curve of 5 to 6 mg per milliliter per minute) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. Crossover to crizotinib treatment after disease progression was permitted for patients receiving chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by independent radiologic review. RESULTS: Progression-free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib than with chemotherapy (median, 10.9 months vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.60; P<0.001). Objective response rates were 74% and 45%, respectively (P<0.001). Median overall survival was not reached in either group (hazard ratio for death with crizotinib, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.26; P=0.36); the probability of 1-year survival was 84% with crizotinib and 79% with chemotherapy. The most common adverse events with crizotinib were vision disorders, diarrhea, nausea, and edema, and the most common events with chemotherapy were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and decreased appetite. As compared with chemotherapy, crizotinib was associated with greater reduction in lung cancer symptoms and greater improvement in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib was superior to standard first-line pemetrexed-plus-platinum chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.

  {"id":"song_deep_2021","abstract":"Abstract Introduction Gene fusion variants in ALK-rearranged NSCLC may predict patient outcomes, but previous results have been inconclusive. Fusion isoforms coexisting in the same tumor may affect the efficacy of targeted therapy, but they have not been investigated. Methods Patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who received crizotinib treatments were recruited. Precrizotinib tumor tissues were analyzed by the anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction for targeted RNA sequencing. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used to compare overall and progression-free survivals. Results Of the 51 studied subjects, EML4-ALK variant types v1, v2, v3, and others were detected in 23 (45.1%), five (9.8%), 19 (37.3%), and four patients (7.8%), respectively. Multiple EML4-ALK RNA isoforms were detected in 24 tumors (47.1%), and single isoform in 27 (52.9%). Most of the v3 tumors (16 of 19) harbored both v3a and v3b RNA isoforms. Multiple isoforms were also detected in eight non-v3 tumors (33.3% of all 24 multiple isoforms; five v1, two v5ÔøΩÔøΩ, and one v2). Compared with patients with single isoform, those with multiple isoforms had worse progression-free (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval: 2.45 [1.06ÔøΩÔøΩ5.69]) and overall (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 3.74 [1.26ÔøΩÔøΩ11.13]) survivals after adjusting for potential confounders including variant type. Using the patient-derived H2228 cells known to express v3a and v3b, our single-cell polymerase chain reaction detected either v3a or v3b in most single cells. Treatment of H2228 cells by three ALK inhibitors revealed increased ratios of v3a-to-v3b expression over time. Conclusions Intratumoral EML4-ALK isoforms may predict the efficacy of targeted therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Temporal changes of intratumoral fusion isoforms may result from differential selection pressures that a drug might have on one isoform over another. Larger studies on fusion heterogeneity using RNA sequencing are warranted.","author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Zhengbo"},{"family":"Lian","given":"Shifeng"},{"family":"Mak","given":"Silvia Y.L."},{"family":"Chow","given":"Maggie Zi-Ying"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Chunwei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenxian"},{"family":"Keung","given":"Hoi Yee"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Chenyu"},{"family":"Kebede","given":"Firaol Tamiru"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Yanqiu"},{"family":"Cheuk","given":"Wah"},{"family":"Cho","given":"William Chi Shing"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Mengsu"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Zongli"}],"citation-key":"song_deep_2021","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

Incidence of somatic mutations in genes recommended for standard-of-care testing varied across cancer types. For instance, in glioblastoma multiforme, small variants were present in 94% of cases and copy number aberrations in at least one gene in 58% of cases, while sarcoma demonstrated the highest occurrence of actionable structural variants (13%). Homologous recombination deficiency was identified in 40% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases with 30% linked to pathogenic germline variants, highlighting the value of combined somatic and germline analysis. The linkage of WGS and longitudinal life course clinical data allowed the assessment of treatment outcomes for patients stratified according to pangenomic markers.

To analyze the changes that second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have brought in mutation frequency and type, a database review was undertaken of the results of all the BCR-ABL KD mutation analyses performed in the authors' laboratory from January 2004 to January 2013.\n\n\n\nMETHODS\n\nInterrogation of the database retrieved 450 mutation analyses in 272 patients with Ph+ ALL. Prescreening of samples was performed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC), followed by direct sequencing of D-HPLCÔøΩ¢ñØositive cases.\n\n\n\nRESULTS\n\nBCR-ABL KD mutations were detected in 70% of imatinib-resistant patients, with T315I, E255K, and Y253H mutations accounting for 75% of cases. Seventy-eight percent of the patients reported to be resistant to second-generation TKIs after imatinib failure were positive for mutations, and 58% of them had multiple mutations. Analysis of patients relapsing on dasatinib revealed a newly acquired T315I mutation in almost two-thirds of the cases. Direct sequencing detected no mutations at diagnosis, even in patients who relapsed after a few months.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSecond-generation TKIs ensure a more rapid debulking of the leukemic clone and have much fewer insensitive mutations, but long-term disease control remains a problem, and the T315I mutation is revealed to be an even more frequent enemy.

  {"id":"soverini_philadelphiapositive_2010","abstract":"Background In patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, resistance to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is frequent and most often associated with the development of point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. We aimed to assess: (i) in how many patients BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are already detectable at relatively low levels at the time of diagnosis, and (ii) whether mutation detection correlates with subsequent response to therapy.Design and Methods We retrospectively analyzed samples collected at diagnosis from 15 patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who subsequently received tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (dasatinib) by cloning the BCR-ABL kinase domain in a bacterial vector and sequencing 200 independent clones per sample.Results Mutations at relatively low levels (2ÔøΩÔøΩ4 clones out of 200) could be detected in all patients ÔøΩÔøΩ eight who relapsed and seven who achieved persistent remission. Each patient had evidence of two to eight different mutations, the majority of which have never been reported in association with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In two patients out of six who relapsed because of a mutation, the mutation (a T315I) was already detectable in a few clones at the time of diagnosis. On the other hand, a patient who was found to harbor an F317L mutation is in persistent remission on dasatinib.Conclusions Our results suggest that the BCR-ABL kinase domain is prone to randomly accumulate point mutations in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, although the presence of these mutations in a relatively small leukemic subclone does not always preclude a primary response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","author":[{"family":"Soverini","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Vitale","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Poerio","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Gnani","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Colarossi","given":"Sabrina"},{"family":"Iacobucci","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Cimino","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Elia","given":"Loredana"},{"family":"Lonetti","given":"Annalisa"},{"family":"Vignetti","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Paolini","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Meloni","given":"Giovanna"},{"family":"Di","given":"Maio Valeria"},{"family":"Papayannidis","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Amabile","given":"Marilina"},{"family":"Guarini","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Baccarani","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Martinelli","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"FoÔøΩ","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"soverini_philadelphiapositive_2010","container-title":"Haematologica","container-title-short":"Haematologica","DOI":"10.3324/haematol.2010.034173","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"552-557","title":"Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients already harbor BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations at low levels at the time of diagnosis.","type":"article-journal","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"spaander_youngonset_2023","abstract":"In the past decades the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in people under the age of 50 years has increased, which is referred to as early-onset CRC or young-onset CRC (YO-CRC). YO-CRC is expected to account for 11% of colon cancers and 23% of rectal cancers by 2030. This trend is observed in different parts of the world and in both men and women. In 20% of patients with YO-CRC, a hereditary cancer syndrome is found as the underlying cause; however, in the majority of patients no genetic predisposition is present. Beginning in the 1950s, major changes in lifestyle such as antibiotic use, low physical activity and obesity have affected the gut microbiome and may be an important factor in YO-CRC development. Owing to a lack of screening, patients with YO-CRC are often diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. Long-term treatment-related complications should be taken into account in these younger patients, making the more traditional sequential approaches of drug therapy not always the most appropriate option. To better understand the underlying mechanism and define relationships between environmental factors and YO-CRC development, long-term prospective studies are needed with lifestyle data collected from childhood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Spaander","given":"Manon C.

Uncovering the exposure relationships that provide selective advantage to specific CH mutations is critical to understanding the pathogenesis and etiology of t-MNs. In a systematic analysis of 416¬†patients with t-MN and detailed prior exposure history, we found that TP53 mutations were significantly associated with prior treatment with thalidomide analogs, specifically lenalidomide. We demonstrated experimentally that lenalidomide treatment provides a selective advantage to Trp53-mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in¬†vitro and in¬†vivo, the effect of which was specific to Trp53-mutant HSPCs and was not observed in HSPCs with other CH mutations. Because of the differences in CK1Œ± degradation, pomalidomide treatment did not provide an equivalent level of selective advantage to Trp53-mutant HSPCs, providing a biological rationale for its use in patients at high risk for t-MN. These findings highlight the role of lenalidomide treatment in promoting TP53-mutated t-MNs and offer a potential alternative strategy to mitigate the risk of t-MN development.","author":[{"family":"Sperling","given":"Adam S"},{"family":"Guerra","given":"Veronica A"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"James A"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Yuanqing"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Joanne I"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Andrew T"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Peter G"},{"family":"McConkey","given":"Marie E"},{"family":"Quevedo","given":"Barrios Vanessa A"},{"family":"Furudate","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Kanagal-Shamanna","given":"Rashmi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"Little","given":"Latasha"},{"family":"Gumbs","given":"Curtis"},{"family":"Daver","given":"Naval"},{"family":"DiNardo","given":"Courtney D"},{"family":"Kadia","given":"Tapan"},{"family":"Ravandi","given":"Farhad"},{"family":"Kantarjian","given":"Hagop"},{"family":"Garcia-Manero","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Futreal","given":"P Andrew"},{"family":"Ebert","given":"Benjamin L"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Koichi"}],"citation-key":"sperling_lenalidomide_2022","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2021014956","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"1753-1763","title":"Lenalidomide promotes the development of TP53-mutated therapy-related myeloid neoplasms.","type":"article-journal","volume":"140"},

Immunotherapies, including the programmed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab, have resulted in durable responses and long-term overall survival in patients with NSCLC. We hypothesized that combining targeted therapy with immunotherapy could result in more patients with responses and/or more durable responses. Herein we report data from a study assessing nivolumab plus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK translocationÔøΩ¢ñØositive NSCLC. Methods Group E in CheckMate 370 was a single-arm cohort designed to evaluate the safety of first-line nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) plus crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) in patients with ALK translocationÔøΩ¢ñØositive NSCLC. The primary endpoint of safety would be met if ÔøΩÔøΩ20% of patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events by week 17. Objective response rate was a secondary endpoint. A planned safety review occurred in November 2016; the data cutoff was May 26, 2017.

This study presents a readily available noninvasive method of measuring and imaging LICs in vivo using clinical 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging units. Mean liver proton transverse relaxation rates (R2) were measured for 105 humans. A value for the LIC for each subject was obtained by chemical assay of a needle biopsy specimen. High degrees of sensitivity and specificity of R2 to biopsy LICs were found at the clinically significant LIC thresholds of 1.8, 3.2, 7.0, and 15.0 mg Fe/g dry tissue. A calibration curve relating liver R2 to LIC has been deduced from the data covering the range of LICs from 0.3 to 42.7 mg Fe/g dry tissue. Proton transverse relaxation rates in aqueous paramagnetic solutions were also measured on each magnetic resonance imaging unit to ensure instrument-independent results. Measurements of proton transverse relaxivity of aqueous MnCl2 phantoms on 13 different magnetic resonance imaging units using the method yielded a coefficient of variation of 2.1%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"St. Pierre","given":"Timothy G."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Chua-anusorn","given":"Wanida"},{"family":"Fleming","given":"Adam J."},{"family":"Jeffrey","given":"Gary P."},{"family":"Olynyk","given":"John K."},{"family":"Pootrakul","given":"Pensri"},{"family":"Robins","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Lindeman","given":"Robert"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"st.pierre_noninvasive_2005","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2004-01-0177","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"855-861","source":"20.3","title":"Noninvasive measurement and imaging of liver iron concentrations using proton magnetic resonance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2004-01-0177","volume":"105"},
  {"id":"stahl_use_2018","abstract":"Most studies of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are limited by small numbers and their single-center nature, and report conflicting data regarding predictors for response to IST. We examined outcomes associated with IST and predictors of benefit in a large international cohort of patients with MDS. Data were collected from 15 centers in the United States and Europe. Responses, including red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (TI), were assessed based on the 2006 MDS International Working Group criteria, and overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Logistic regression models estimated odds for response and TI, and Cox Proportional Hazard models estimated hazards ratios for OS. We identified 207 patients with MDS receiving IST, excluding steroid monotherapy. The most common IST regimen was anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) plus prednisone (43%). Overall response rate (ORR) was 48.8%, including 11.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.5%-18.4%) who achieved a complete remission and 30% (95% CI, 22.3%-39.5%) who achieved RBC TI. Median OS was 47.4 months (95% CI, 37-72.3 months) and was longer for patients who achieved a response or TI. Achievement of RBC TI was associated with a hypocellular bone marrow (cellularity < 20%); horse ATG plus cyclosporine was more effective than rabbit ATG or ATG without cyclosporine. Age, transfusion dependence, presence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or large granular lymphocyte clones, and HLA DR15 positivity did not predict response to IST. IST leads to objective responses in nearly half the selected patients with the highest rate of RBC TI achieved in patients with hypocellular bone marrows.","author":[{"family":"Stahl","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"DeVeaux","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"de","given":"Witte Theo"},{"family":"Neukirchen","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Sekeres","given":"Mikkael A."},{"family":"Brunner","given":"Andrew M."},{"family":"Roboz","given":"Gail J."},{"family":"Steensma","given":"David P."},{"family":"Bhatt","given":"Vijaya Raj"},{"family":"Platzbecker","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Cluzeau","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Prata","given":"Pedro Henrique"},{"family":"Itzykson","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Fenaux","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Fathi","given":"Amir T."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Germing","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Ritchie","given":"Ellen K."},{"family":"Verma","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"Nazha","given":"Aziz"},{"family":"Maciejewski","given":"Jaroslaw P."},{"family":"Podoltsev","given":"Nikolai A."},{"family":"Prebet","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Santini","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Gore","given":"Steven D."},{"family":"Komrokji","given":"Rami S."},{"family":"Zeidan","given":"Amer M."}],"citation-key":"stahl_use_2018","container-title":"Blood advances","container-title-short":"Blood Adv.","DOI":"10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019414","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1765-1772","title":"The use of immunosuppressive therapy in MDS: clinical outcomes and their predictors in a large international patient cohort","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"streiff_effectiveness_2018","abstract":"Anticoagulation is used to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients, but may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. VTE recurrence and major bleeding were assessed in cancer patients treated for VTE with the most currently prescribed anticoagulants in clinical practice. Newly diagnosed cancer patients (first VTE 1/1/2013-05/31/2015) who initiated rivaroxaban, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or warfarin were identified from Humana claims data and observed until end of eligibility or end of data availability. VTE recurrence was a hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of VTE  7 days after first VTE. Major bleeding events on treatment were identified using validated criteria. Cohorts were compared using Kaplan‚ÄìMeier rates at 6 and 12 months and Cox proportional hazards models. Cohorts were adjusted for their differences at baseline. A total of 2428 patients (rivaroxaban: 707; LMWH: 660; warfarin: 1061) met inclusion criteria. Patient characteristics were well balanced after weighting. There was a trend for lower VTE recurrence rates in rivaroxaban users compared to LMWH users at 6 months (13.2% vs. 17.1%; P 5 .060) and significantly lower at 12 months (16.5% vs. 22.2%; P 5 .030) [HR: 0.72, 95% CI: (0.52-0.95); P 5 .024]. VTE recurrence rates were also lower for rivaroxaban than warfarin users at 6 months (13.2% vs. 17.5%; P 5 .014) and 12 months (15.7% vs. 19.9%; P 5 .017) [HR: 0.74, 95% CI: (0.56-0.96); P 5 .028]. Major bleeding rates were similar across cohorts. This real-world analysis suggests cancer patients with VTE treated with rivaroxaban had significantly lower risk of recurrent VTE and similar risk of bleeding compared to those treated with LMWH or warfarin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Streiff","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Milentijevic","given":"Dejan"},{"family":"McCrae","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Yannicelli","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Fortier","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Winnie W."},{"family":"Lalibert√©","given":"Fran√ßois"},{"family":"Crivera","given":"Concetta"},{"family":"Lefebvre","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Schein","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Khorana","given":"Alok A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"streiff_effectiveness_2018","container-title":"American Journal of Hematology","container-title-short":"Am J Hematol","DOI":"10.1002/ajh.25059","ISSN":"03618609","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"language":"en","page":"664-671","source":"13.265","title":"Effectiveness and safety of anticoagulants for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajh.25059","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"sui_braf_2021","abstract":"Rationale Patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EML4-ALK rearrangements respond well to multiple ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the tumor will invariably progress due to acquired resistance. Comprehensive genomic profiling appears to be a promising strategy to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of ALK-TKIs resistance. Patient concerns A patient with right lung adenocarcinoma harboring an ALK rearrangement received targeted therapy with multiple ALK-TKIs. He sought for follow-up treatment after his disease progressed again. Diagnosis The patient had a tumor diagnosed with stage I (T1bN0M0) lung adenocarcinoma. Interventions Due to the surgical contraindication, the patient did not undergo surgical resection. Instead, he received crizotinib as the first-line therapy with the progression-free survival of 20 months. Then he switched to alectinib treatment, however the disease rapidly progressed again. Outcomes Next-generation sequencing was performed and revealed that 7 somatic mutations were identified. Among them, 2 mutations, ALK I1171T and BRAF V600E, may be responsible for the resistance of this patient to ALK-TKIs. BRAF V600E mutation may explain the patient's resistance to lorlatinib. Lessons We present a case of ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma with acquired resistance to ALK inhibition, in which the BRAF V600E mutation is a novel resistance mechanism.

Over the past decades, these agents have demonstrated dramatic efficacy, especially in patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nonetheless, in the field of a broad concept of solid tumours, non-specific indications, inseparable immune response and side effects, unconfirmed progressive disease, and complex regulatory networks of immune resistance are four barriers that limit its widespread application. Fortunately, the successful clinical trials of novel ICB agents and combination therapies, the advent of the era of oncolytic virus gene editing, and the breakthrough of the technical barriers of mRNA vaccines and nano-delivery systems have made remarkable breakthroughs currently.

  {"id":"swan_venous_2018","abstract":"Multiple myeloma is associated with a signiÔ¨Åcant risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), causing substantial levels of morbidity and mortality. The thrombogenicity of myeloma is multifactorial, with disease- and treatment-related factors playing important roles. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and high-dose dexamethasone, in particular, are known to enhance the thrombotic potential of myeloma. For this reason, assessment of the VTE risk has long been advocated prior to treatment initiation in patients with myeloma requiring IMiD-based regimens. However, despite routine use of thromboprophylaxis, these patients can still develop VTE and its sequelae. The optimum choice and dose of thromboprophylactic drug is not entirely clear, and with this, there is growing interest regarding use of the direct oral anticoagulants in this setting. In this review we discuss the pathogenesis of thrombosis in multiple myeloma, its relation to some of the commonly used chemotherapeutic regimens, current risk stratiÔ¨Åcation and the evidence supporting the different anticoagulants used as thromboprophylaxis. We propose an amended risk stratiÔ¨Åcation, and consider management of challenging patients, including those with renal impairment and recurrent thrombosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Swan","given":"Dawn"},{"family":"Rocci","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Thachil","given":"Jecko"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"swan_venous_2018","container-title":"British Journal of Haematology","container-title-short":"Br J Haematol","DOI":"10.1111/bjh.15684","ISSN":"00071048","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"language":"en","page":"538-556","source":"8.615","title":"Venous thromboembolism in multiple myeloma - choice of prophylaxis, role of direct oral anticoagulants and special considerations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjh.15684","volume":"183"},

  {"id":"t_targeting_2020","abstract":"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells with a clinical course characterized by multiple relapses and treatment refractoriness. While recent treatment advancements have extended overall survival (OS), refractory MM has a poor prognosis, with a median OS of between 4 and 6 months. Nuclear export inhibition, specifically inhibition of CRM1/XPO1, is an emerging novel treatment modality that has shown promise in treatment-refractory MM. Initially discovered in yeast in 1983, early clinical applications were met with significant toxicities that limited their utility. The creation of small molecule inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) has improved on toxicity limitations and has led to investigation in a number of malignancies at the preclinical and clinical stages. Preclinical studies of SINEs in MM have shown that¬†these molecules are cytotoxic to myeloma cells, play a role in therapy resensitization, and suggest a role in limiting bone disease progression. In July 2019, selinexor became the first nuclear export inhibitor approved for use in relapsed/refractory MM based on the STORM trial. As of May 2020, there were eight ongoing trials combining selinexor with standard treatment regimens in relapsed/refractory MM. Eltanexor, a second-generation SINE, is also under investigation and has shown preliminary signs of efficacy in an early clinical trial while potentially having¬†an improved toxicity profile compared with selinexor. Results in ongoing trials will help further define the role of SINEs in MM.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"T","given":"heodoropoulos Nicholas"},{"family":"L","given":"ancman Guido"},{"family":"C","given":"hari Ajai"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"t_targeting_2020","container-title":"Targeted Oncology","container-title-short":"Targ Oncol","DOI":"10.1007/s11523-020-00758-2","ISSN":"1776-260X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"697-708","source":"4.864","title":"Targeting Nuclear Export Proteins in Multiple Myeloma Therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-020-00758-2","volume":"15"},

Several clinical forms of Œ±-thalassaemia and Œ≤-thalassaemia, including the co-inheritance of Œ≤-thalassaemia with haemoglobin E resulting in haemoglobin E/Œ≤-thalassaemia, have been described. The disease hallmarks include imbalance in the Œ±/Œ≤-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic haemolytic anaemia, compensatory haemopoietic expansion, hypercoagulability, and increased intestinal iron absorption. The complications of iron overload, arising from transfusions that represent the basis of disease management in most patients with severe thalassaemia, might further complicate the clinical phenotype. These pathophysiological mechanisms lead to an array of clinical manifestations involving numerous organ systems. Conventional management primarily relies on transfusion and iron-chelation therapy, as well as splenectomy in specific cases. An increased understanding of the molecular and pathogenic factors that govern the disease process have suggested routes for the development of new therapeutic approaches that address the underlying chain imbalance, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron dysregulation, with several agents being evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials.","author":[{"family":"T","given":"aher Ali T."},{"family":"W","given":"eatherall David J."},{"family":"C","given":"appellini Maria Domenica"}],"citation-key":"t_thalassaemia_2018","container-title":"Lancet (London, England)","container-title-short":"Lancet (Lond.

  {"id":"tabbo_how_2022","abstract":"The advent of high-throughput sequencing has allowed to profoundly interrogate the molecular landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the last years. These findings constitute the opportunity to better stratify these patients in order to address specific treatments to well-defined oncogene-restricted subgroups. Among them, BRAF-mutated lung cancers represent around 4% of NSCLC, thus identifying a clinically relevant popu¬≠ lation that should be aptly managed. Pivotal phase II trials have demonstrated the efficacy of combinatorial treatment - dabrafenib plus trametinib, targeting both BRAF and MEK - for patients harboring V600E mutations, making this specific BRAF alteration a mandatory requirement in the genetic portrait of advanced non-squamous lung cancer patients. However, around half of BRAF+ NSCLC patients remain orphan of targeted approaches. Here we review the available evidence, mainly from a clinical perspective, of therapeutic strategies for both V600E and non-V600 patients, in terms of small molecule, immune checkpoint inhibitors and forthcoming in¬≠ tegrated strategies. Looking at on-going clinical trials, a special attention is dedicated to emergent molecules and combinatorial strategies that not only will improve outcomes of classical V600E, but also will make concrete the chance of tailored treatments for the majority of BRAF-mutated patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Tabb√≤","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Pisano","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Mazieres","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Mezquita","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Nadal","given":"Ernest"},{"family":"Planchard","given":"David"},{"family":"Pradines","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Santamaria","given":"David"},{"family":"Swalduz","given":"Aur√©lie"},{"family":"Ambrogio","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Novello","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Ortiz-Cuaran","given":"Sandra"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"tabbo_how_2022","container-title":"Cancer Treatment Reviews","container-title-short":"Cancer Treatment Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.ctrv.2021.102335","ISSN":"03057372","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2]]},"language":"en","page":"102335","source":"11.8","title":"How far we have come targeting BRAF-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305737221001833","volume":"103"},

Eligible patients had disease progression during or within 6 months of the last dose of first-line therapy. Patients were randomised (1:1) via a centralised, interactive voice-response system to receive 8 mg/kg intravenous ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI or matching placebo plus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or death. Randomisation was stratified by region, KRAS mutation status, and time to disease progression after starting first-line treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01183780.ld\nFINDINGS: We enrolled 1072 patients (536 in each group).

Cohort 1 includes patients with locally advanced or unresectable or mUC who had progressed after prior PLT and CPI. Patients received SG 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles. The primary outcome was centrally reviewed ORR; secondary outcomes were progression-free survival, OS, duration of response, and safety.\nRESULTS Cohort 1 included 113 patients (78% men; median age, 66 years; 66.4% visceral metastases; median of three [range, 1-8] prior therapies). At a median follow-up of 9.1 months, the ORR was 27% (31 of 113; 95% CI, 19.5 to 36.6); 77% had decrease in measurable disease. Median duration of response was 7.2 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 8.6 months), with median progression-free survival and OS of 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 7.2 months) and 10.9 months (95% CI, 9.0 to 13.8 months), respectively. Key grade $ 3 treatment-related adverse events included neutropenia (35%), leukopenia (18%), anemia (14%), diarrhea (10%), and febrile neutropenia (10%), with 6% discontinuing treatment because of treatment-related adverse events.\nCONCLUSION SG is an active drug with a manageable safety proÔ¨Åle with most common toxicities of neutropenia and diarrhea. SG has notable efÔ¨Åcacy compared with historical controls in pretreated mUC that has progressed on both prior PLT regimens and CPI. The results from this study supported accelerated approval of SG in this population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Tagawa","given":"Scott T."},{"family":"Balar","given":"Arjun V."},{"family":"Petrylak","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Kalebasty","given":"Arash Rezazadeh"},{"family":"Loriot","given":"Yohann"},{"family":"Fl√©chon","given":"Aude"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Rohit K."},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Neeraj"},{"family":"Bupathi","given":"Manojkumar"},{"family":"Barthelemy","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Beuzeboc","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Palmbos","given":"Phillip"},{"family":"Kyriakopoulos","given":"Christos E."},{"family":"Pouessel","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Sternberg","given":"Cora N."},{"family":"Hong","given":"Quan"},{"family":"Goswami","given":"Trishna"},{"family":"Itri","given":"Loretta M."},{"family":"Grivas","given":"Petros"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"tagawa_trophyu01_2021","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.20.03489","ISSN":"0732-183X, 1527-7755","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2474-2485","source":"45.3","title":"TROPHY-U-01: A Phase II Open-Label Study of Sacituzumab Govitecan in Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma Progressing After Platinum-Based Chemotherapy and Checkpoint Inhibitors","title-short":"TROPHY-U-01","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.20.03489","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"takahashi_overcoming_2020","abstract":"Background Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion genes are found in 3%-5% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). ALK inhibitors show a very high response rate to ALK-positive NSCLCs. However, the emergence of acquired resistance is inevitable. In this study, we investigated the drugs for overcoming resistance especially compound mutations after sequential treatment with crizotinib, alectinib, and lorlatinib. Method Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing were performed on a liver biopsy tissue obtained from a clinical case. Ba/F3 cells in which mutant EML4-ALK were overexpressed were prepared, and cell viability assay and immunoblotting were performed to check the sensitivity of five independent ALK inhibitors. Results I1171S + G1269A double mutation was identified by NGS and Sanger sequencing on a liver biopsy tissue from a patient who relapsed on lorlatinib treatment. Ceritinib and brigatinib-but not other ALK inhibitors-were active against the compound mutations in the cell line model. Conclusions With the sequential ALK inhibitors treatment, cancer cells accumulate new mutations in addition to mutations acquired previously. The identified compound mutation (I1171S + G1269A) was found to be sensitive to ceritinib and brigatinib, and indeed the patient's tumor partially responded to ceritinib. Key points ALK compound mutation was found in a clinical sample that was resistant to lorlatinib after sequential ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Ceritinib and brigatinib are potential overcoming drugs against ALK I1171S + G1269A double mutation.","author":[{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Seto","given":"Yosuke"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Koutaroh"},{"family":"Uematsu","given":"Shinya"},{"family":"Uchibori","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Tsukahara","given":"Mika"},{"family":"Oh-hara","given":"Tomoko"},{"family":"Fujita","given":"Naoya"},{"family":"Yanagitani","given":"Noriko"},{"family":"Nishio","given":"Makoto"},{"family":"Okubo","given":"Kenichi"},{"family":"Katayama","given":"Ryohei"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"takahashi_overcoming_2020","container-title":"Thoracic cancer","container-title-short":"Thorac.

Although the association between BRAF mutations and microsatellite instability (MSI) has been known for several years, previous clinical trials have revealed that the former has a limited prognostic impact and that immune checkpoint inhibitors offer a significant survival benefit to mCRC patients with both characteristics. Furthermore, the genomic classification of BRAF mutations according to their molecular functions enables greater understanding of the characteristics of mCRC patients with BRAF mutations, with therapeutic strategies based on this classification made more ideal to improve poor prognosis through the delivery of targeted therapies. Recently, a phase III trial was conducted in previously treated mCRC patients with BRAF V600E‚Äìmutated tumors and revealed that the combination therapy approach of BRAF inhibition and anti‚Äìepidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy with or without MEK inhibition was more efficacious than standard chemotherapy alone.

The combination of EGFR-TKI afatinib and anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab can overcome acquired resistance in mouse models and human patients. Since afatinib is also a potent HER2 inhibitor, we investigated the role of HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumor cells. We show in vitro and in vivo that afatinib plus cetuximab significantly inhibits HER2 phosphorylation. HER2 overexpression or knockdown confers resistance or sensitivity, respectively, in all studied cell line models. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that HER2 was amplified in 12% of tumors with acquired resistance versus only 1% of untreated lung adenocarcinomas. Notably, HER2 amplification and EGFR T790M were mutually exclusive.

However, these inhibitors are associated with resistant mutations outside the C481 hot spot.

Part 2 (expansion) consisted of disease-specific cohorts, including treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The primary end points were safety and tolerability, and definition of the maximum tolerated dose (part 1). Additional end points included pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy. Reported herein are results from 144 patients enrolled in the dose-finding and CLL/SLL cohorts. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred in dose escalation. Median BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was >95% at all doses. Sustained complete (>95%) BTK occupancy in lymph node biopsy specimens was more frequent with 160 mg twice daily than 320 mg once daily (89% vs 50%; P = .0342). Consequently, 160 mg twice daily was selected for further investigation. With median follow-up of 13.7 months (range, 0.4-30.5 months), 89 CLL/SLL patients (94.7%) remain on study.

Direct sequencing using DNA from tumour specimens was performed by a central laboratory to detect EGFR mutations. Patients harbouring EGFR mutations received gefitinib. The primary study objective was response; the secondary objectives were toxicity, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year survival (1Y-S) and the disease control rate (DCR). Between March 2005 and January 2006, 118 patients were recruited from 15 institutions and were screened for EGFR mutations, which were detected in 32 patients ÔøΩÔøΩ 28 of whom were enrolled in the present study. The overall response rate was 75%, the DCR was 96% and the median PFS was 11.5 months. The median OS has not yet been reached, and the 1Y-S was 79%. Thus, gefitinib chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations was highly effective. This trial documents the feasibility of performing a multicentre phase II study using a central typing laboratory, demonstrating the benefit to patients of selecting gefitinib treatment based on their EGFR mutation status.","author":[{"family":"Tamura","given":"Kenji"},{"family":"Okamoto","given":"Isamu"},{"family":"Kashii","given":"Tatsuhiko"},{"family":"Negoro","given":"S."},{"family":"Hirashima","given":"T."},{"family":"Kudoh","given":"S."},{"family":"Ichinose","given":"Yukito"},{"family":"Ebi","given":"N"},{"family":"Shibata","given":"K"},{"family":"Nishimura","given":"Toshihide"},{"family":"Katakami","given":"Nobuyuki"},{"family":"Sawa","given":"T"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Eiji"},{"family":"Fukuoka","given":"Junya"},{"family":"Satoh","given":"Taroh"},{"family":"Fukuoka","given":"Masahiro"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"tamura_multicentre_2008","container-title":"British journal of cancer","container-title-short":"Br.

  {"id":"tan_venetoclax_2020","abstract":"Background: The present standard induction treatment for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (ND AML) is three days' daunorubicin or idarubicin plus seven days' cytarabine chemotherapy (3+7). Venetoclax plus azacytidine or low dose cytarabine is effective and better than azacitidine or low dose cytarabine alone for ND AML in VIALE A and VIALE C trials, respectively and the outcome by Venetoclax dose levels was not different between 400 mg, 800 mg, or 1200 mg a day. As a strong CYP3A inhibitor, posaconazole can increase serum level of Venetoclax and the dosage could be reduced to 75~100mg a day.Method: We treat ND AML patients with uninterrupted Venetoclax 100 mg plus posaconazole 300 mg daily and 7 days' standard dose of cytarabine (100 mg/m2/day) or 7 days' azacitidine (75 mg/m2/d), followed by 5 days' consolidation cytarabine (100 mg/m2/d) or another 7 days' azacitidine, and then followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Results: Eight patients have enrolled the treatment including 7 underwent venetoclax/posaconazole/cytarabine and one venetoclax/posaconazole/azacitidine patients and four patients are secondary AML (one myeloma, one MDS, and 2 breast cancer patients). All patients were hematologic complete remission achieved in one month and 6 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation including one from matched sibling, two from matched unrelated, and three from haplo-identical donors (sons). Febrile neutropenia rates were similar to 3+7 treatment patients on historical comparison but shorter period of febrile illness. There was no grade II or higher adverse effect of oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract as compared with conventional 3+7 therapy. Two out of six allo-transplant patients got leukemia relapse then salvage treatment ensued and the other 2 non-transplant and 4 allo-transplant patients are persisted in complete remission.Conclusion: Venetoclax plus posaconazole and standard dose cytarabine is a feasible choice of induction therapy in ND AML and high CR rate and transplant rate achieved and there was no detrimental effect upon the hematopoietic recovery during induction and transplant therapy.FigureNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Tran-Der"},{"family":"Chiou","given":"Lun-Wei"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"tan_venetoclax_2020","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2020-142409","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"Supplement 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,5]]},"language":"en","page":"41","source":"25.476","title":"Venetoclax and posaconazole plus standard dose cytarabine or azacytidine for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2020-142409","volume":"136"},

We hypothesize that enhancing apoptosis through combination therapies can eradicate cancer cells and reduce the emergence of drug-tolerant persisters. Through high-throughput screening of a custom library of ÔøΩÔøΩ1,000 compounds, we discover Aurora B kinase inhibitors as potent enhancers of osimertinib-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, Aurora B inhibition stabilizes BIM through reduced Ser87 phosphorylation, and transactivates PUMA through FOXO1/3. Importantly, osimertinib resistance caused by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activates the ATR-CHK1-Aurora B signaling cascade and thereby engenders hypersensitivity to respective kinase inhibitors by activating BIM-mediated mitotic catastrophe. Combined inhibition of EGFR and Aurora B not only efficiently eliminates cancer cells but also overcomes resistance beyond EMT.","author":[{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Kosuke"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Helena A."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Shaoyuan"},{"family":"Han","given":"Song"},{"family":"Selcuklu","given":"S.

  {"id":"tangpeerachaikul_abstract_2021","abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>ALK receptor tyrosine kinase can be aberrantly activated by gene rearrangement or point mutation to drive tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. ALK rearrangements are detected in up to 5% of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and up to 40% of patients present with brain metastases at diagnosis. Crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib are FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors for ALK-positive NSCLC. However, durability of response to these treatments is partly limited by mutations in ALK that confer resistance. The G1202R solvent front mutation is commonly observed in patients that have progressed on crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, or brigatinib. Patients with tumors harboring G1202R have responded to lorlatinib, but many have relapsed after acquiring compound mutations such as G1202R/L1196M and G1202R/G1269A. Another challenge with lorlatinib is central nervous system (CNS) adverse events attributed to inhibition of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TRKB), a kinase structurally related to ALK. NVL-655 is a novel preclinical brain-penetrant ALK inhibitor with selectivity over TRKB. We previously reported that NVL-655 inhibits ALK G1202R, G1202R/L1196M, G1202R/G1269A, and G1202R/L1198F in vitro; has favorable kinome and ALK-vs-TRKB selectivity profiles; and shows antitumor activity in a Ba/F3 EML4-ALK variant 1 (v1) G1202R/L1196M xenograft model. Here we report results of a broader preclinical characterization of NVL-655 across ALK models, including an intracranial model. NVL-655 was observed to induce regression in a HIP1-ALK patient-derived xenograft model, an EML4-ALK v1 human cancer cell line-derived model (NCI-H3122), and Ba/F3 xenograft models expressing EML4-ALK v1 G1202R and G1202R/G1269A. Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker analyses supported in vivo ALK inhibition by NVL-655. Furthermore, NVL-655 was observed to reduce tumor size and prolong survival by more than 4-fold in a mouse intracranial tumor model of Ba/F3 EML4-ALK v1 G1202R/L1196M luciferase. In conclusion, NVL-655 has a preclinical profile that we believe supports its potential to address a medical need for patients with ALK-positive disease, including those with G1202R compound mutations. We believe the findings presented here support the evaluation of NVL-655 for the treatment of patients with ALK-driven disease.</jats:p> <jats:p>Citation Format: Anupong Tangpeerachaikul, Amit Deshpande, Nancy E.

However, some patients show intrinsic resistance and an insufficient response to osimertinib. This study showed that osimertinib stimulated AXL by inhibiting a negative feedback loop. Activated AXL was associated with EGFR and HER3 in maintaining cell survival and inducing the emergence of cells tolerant to osimertinib. AXL inhibition reduced the viability of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cells overexpressing AXL that were exposed to osimertinib. The addition of an AXL inhibitor during either the initial or tolerant phases reduced tumor size and delayed tumor re-growth compared to osimertinib alone. AXL was highly expressed in clinical specimens of EGFR-mutated lung cancers and its high expression was associated with a low response rate to EGFR-TKI. These results indicated pivotal roles for AXL and its inhibition in the intrinsic resistance to osimertinib and the emergence of osimertinib-tolerant cells.","author":[{"family":"Taniguchi","given":"Hirokazu"},{"family":"Yamada","given":"Tadaaki"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Rong"},{"family":"Tanimura","given":"Keiko"},{"family":"Adachi","given":"Yuta"},{"family":"Nishiyama","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Tanimoto","given":"Azusa"},{"family":"Takeuchi","given":"Shinji"},{"family":"Araujo","given":"Luiz H."},{"family":"Boroni","given":"Mariana"},{"family":"Yoshimura","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Shiotsu","given":"Shinsuke"},{"family":"Matsumoto","given":"Isao"},{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Kikuchi","given":"Toshiaki"},{"family":"Miura","given":"Satoru"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Kitazaki","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Yamaguchi","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Mukae","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Uchino","given":"Junji"},{"family":"Uehara","given":"Hisanori"},{"family":"Takayama","given":"Koichi"},{"family":"Yano","given":"Seiji"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"taniguchi_axl_2019","container-title":"Nature communications","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"tehranchi_granulocyte_2002","abstract":"Low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including refractory anemia and sideroblastic anemia, are characterized by increased apoptotic death of erythroid progenitors. The signaling pathways that elicit this pathologic cell death in MDS have, however, remained unclear. Treatment with erythropoietin in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may synergistically improve the anemia in patients with MDS, with a concomitant decrease in the number of apoptotic bone marrow precursors. Moreover, we have previously reported that G-CSF inhibits Fas-induced caspase activation in sideroblastic anemia (RARS). The present data demonstrate that almost 50% of erythroid progenitor cells derived from patients with MDS exhibit spontaneous release of cytochrome c from mitochondria with ensuing activation of caspase-9, whereas normal erythroid progenitors display neither of these features. G-CSF significantly inhibited cytochrome c release and suppressed apoptosis, most noticeably in cells from patients with sideroblastic anemia. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-9 suppressed both spontaneous and Fas-mediated apoptosis of erythroid progenitors in all low-risk MDS cases studied. We propose that the increased sensitivity of MDS progenitor cells to death receptor stimulation is due to a constitutive activation of the mitochondrial axis of the apoptotic signaling pathway in these cells. These studies yield a mechanistic explanation for the beneficial clinical effects of growth factor administration in patients with MDS, and provide a model for the study of growth factor‚Äìmediated suppression of apoptosis in other bone marrow disorders.","author":[{"family":"Tehranchi","given":"Ramin"},{"family":"Fadeel","given":"Bengt"},{"family":"Forsblom","given":"Ann-Mari"},{"family":"Christensson","given":"Birger"},{"family":"Samuelsson","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Zhivotovsky","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Hellstr√∂m-Lindberg","given":"Eva"}],"citation-key":"tehranchi_granulocyte_2002","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2002-06-1774","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"1080-1086","title":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor inhibits spontaneous cytochrome c release and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis of myelodysplastic syndrome hematopoietic progenitors.","type":"article-journal","volume":"101"},

Patients were compared with age- and sex-matched patients who had an acute coronary syndrome.\nRESULTS Of 1750 patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, 89.8% were women (mean age, 66.8 years). Emotional triggers were not as common as physical triggers (27.7% vs. 36.0%), and 28.5% of patients had no evident trigger. Among patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, as compared with an acute coronary syndrome, rates of neurologic or psychiatric disorders were higher (55.8% vs. 25.7%) and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was markedly lower (40.7¬±11.2% vs. 51.5¬±12.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of severe in-hospital complications including shock and death were similar in the two groups (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.93). Physical triggers, acute neurologic or psychiatric diseases, high troponin levels, and a low ejection fraction on admission were independent predictors for in-hospital complications.

  {"id":"tessier_testing_2021","abstract":"Background‚Äîsmoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) is highly heterogeneous and several models have been suggested to predict this risk. Lakshman et al. recently proposed a model based on three biomarkers: bone marrow plasma cell (BMPC) percentage > 20%, free light chain ratio (FLCr) > 20 and serum M protein > 20 g/L. The goal of our study was to test this ‚Äú20/20/20‚Äù model in our population and to determine if similar results could be obtained in another cohort of SMM patients.

Patients received the study drug for 3 to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism.

  {"id":"therkelsen_longterm_2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), a rare CNS malignancy, is usually treated with high-dose methotrexate in the first-line setting, typically followed by consolidation therapy. Due to the broad range of currently available treatments for PCNSL, comparability in long-term follow-up studies is limited, and data are scattered across small studies.\nMETHODS: In this study, we report the long-term survival of patients with newly diagnosed immunocompetent PCNSL, enrolled in a phase II trial from June 2005 to September 2011. Patients were treated using rituximab, methotrexate, vincristine, and procarbazine (R-MVP) chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in those with partial or complete response to R-MVP. In a post hoc analysis, clinical and imaging features were evaluated in those still alive.\nRESULTS: 26 of 32 patients underwent HDC-ASCT consolidation. Of them, 3 patients died of treatment-related toxicity and 2 due to disease progression within 1 year of ASCT. None of the remaining 21 patients had disease progression with a median follow-up of 12.1 years and were included in the analysis. Compared with the post-HDC-ASCT assessment, at the last follow-up, there was no significant difference in the median Karnofsky Performance Status (80 [range: 60-100] vs 90 [range: 70-100]), the median Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology score (1 [range: 0-4] vs 1 [range: 0-5]), and leukoencephalopathy score (1 [range: 0-3] vs 1 [range: 1-4]).\nDISCUSSION: Long-term follow-up demonstrated that treatment was well tolerated in most patients enrolled in this study, with stable leukoencephalopathy on imaging and stable clinical performance status.

Single-agent epcoritamab previously demonstrated potent antitumor activity in dose escalation across B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In the dose-expansion cohort of a phase I/II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03625037), adults with relapsed or refractory CD20+ large B-cell lymphoma and at least two prior therapy lines (including anti-CD20 therapies) received subcutaneous epcoritamab in 28-day cycles (once weekly step-up doses in weeks 1-3 of cycle 1, then full doses once weekly through cycle 3, once every 2 weeks in cycles 4-9, and once every 4 weeks in cycle 10 and thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was overall response rate by the independent review committee.\nRESULTS: As of January 31, 2022, 157 patients were treated (median age, 64 years [range, 20-83]; median of three [range, 2-11] prior therapy lines; primary refractory disease: 61.1%; prior chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell exposure: 38.9%).

  {"id":"tiede_how_2011","abstract":"The acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is a bleeding disorder that is frequently unrecognized or is misdiagnosed as von Willebrand disease. AVWS is characterized by structural or functional defects of von Willebrand factor (VWF) that are secondary to autoimmune, lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative, malignant, cardiovascular, or other disorders. VWF abnormalities in these disorders can result from (1) antibody-mediated clearance or functional interference, (2) adsorption to surfaces of transformed cells or platelets, or (3) increased shear stress and subsequent proteolysis. Diagnosis can be challenging as no single test is usually sufficient to prove or exclude AVWS. Furthermore, there are no evidence-based guidelines for management. Treatments of the underlying medical condition, including chemo/radiotherapy, surgery, or immunosuppressants can result in remission of AVWS, but is not always feasible and successful. Because of the heterogeneous mechanisms of AVWS, more than one therapeutic approach is often required to treat acute bleeds and for prophylaxis during invasive procedures; the treatment options include, but are not limited to, desmopressin, VWF-containing concentrates, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis or recombinant factor VIIa.

  {"id":"tiercy_how_2016","abstract":"Recognition of HLA incompatibilities by the immune system represents a major barrier to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HLA genotypically identical sibling donors are, therefore, the gold standard for transplantation purposes, but only 30% patients have such a donor. For the remaining 70% patients alternative sources of stem cells are a matched unrelated adult volunteer donor, a haploidentical donor or a cord blood unit. The definition of ‚ÄòHLA matching‚Äô depends on the level of resolution and on which loci are tested. The development of HLA molecular typing technologies and the availability of more than 27 million donors in the international database has greatly facilitated unrelated donor searches. The gold standard is high resolution typing at the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 loci (10/10 match). Single disparities for HLA-A, -B, - C, or -DRB1 are associated with increased risk of post-transplant complications, but less so in patients with advanced disease, and in those undergoing T-cell-depleted allografting. HLA-DQB1 mismatches seem to be better tolerated and some HLA-C, -DRB1 and -DPB1 disparities are potentially less immunogenic. HLA typing by next-generation sequencing methods is likely to change matching algorithms by providing full sequence information on all HLA loci in a single step. In most European populations a 10/10 matched donor can be found for at least 50% of patients and an additional 20‚Äì30% patients may have a 9/10 matched donor. Genetic factors that help in identifying donors with less immunogenic mismatches are discussed. Haploidentical donors are increasingly used as an alternative source of stem cells for those patients lacking a matched unrelated donor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Tiercy","given":"Jean-Marie"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"tiercy_how_2016","container-title":"Haematologica","container-title-short":"Haematologica","DOI":"10.3324/haematol.2015.141119","ISSN":"0390-6078","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6]]},"language":"en","page":"680-687","PMCID":"PMC5013969","PMID":"27252513","source":"11.047","title":"How to select the best available related or unrelated donor of hematopoietic stem cells?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5013969/","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"to_single_2019","abstract":"Allosteric kinase inhibitors offer a potentially complementary therapeutic strategy to ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors due to their distinct sites of target binding. In this study, we identify and study a mutant-selective EGFR allosteric inhibitor, JBJ-04-125-02, which as a single agent can inhibit cell proliferation and EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S signaling in vitro and in vivo. However, increased EGFR dimer formation limits treatment efficacy and leads to drug resistance. Remarkably, osimertinib, an ATP-competitive covalent EGFR inhibitor, uniquely and significantly enhances the binding of JBJ-04-125-02 for mutant EGFR. The combination of osimertinib and JBJ-04-125-02 results in an increase in apoptosis, a more effective inhibition of cellular growth, and an increased efficacy in vitro and in vivo compared with either single agent alone. Collectively, our findings suggest that the combination of a covalent mutant-selective ATP-competitive inhibitor and an allosteric EGFR inhibitor may be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: The clinical efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in EGFR-mutant lung cancer is limited by acquired drug resistance, thus highlighting the need for alternative strategies to inhibit EGFR. Here, we identify a mutant EGFR allosteric inhibitor that is effective as a single agent and in combination with the EGFR TKI osimertinib.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813.","author":[{"family":"To","given":"Ciric"},{"family":"Jang","given":"Jaebong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Park","given":"Eun Young"},{"family":"Mushajiang","given":"Mierzhati"},{"family":"De","given":"Clercq Dries"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Man"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Cameron","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Heppner","given":"David E."},{"family":"Shin","given":"Bo Hee"},{"family":"Gero","given":"Thomas W."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Annan"},{"family":"Dahlberg","given":"Suzanne E."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Kwok-Kin"},{"family":"Eck","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Gray","given":"Nathanael S."},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"to_single_2019","container-title":"Cancer discovery","container-title-short":"Cancer Discov.","DOI":"10.1158/2159-8290.cd-18-0903","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"926-943","source":"28.2","title":"Single and Dual Targeting of Mutant EGFR with an Allosteric Inhibitor.","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"tobiasson_s167_2022","abstract":"Background: One third of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Early detection of impending relapse would enable pre-emptive treatment and potentially reduce relapse risk but is limited by the lack of sensitive markers for measurable residual disease (MRD). We developed a pipeline where patient-specific mutations, as determined by a myeloid next generation sequencing (NGS) panel are tracked using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Aims: To evaluate if personalized MRD detection by ddPCR can predict clinical relapse earlier than conventional methods. Methods: The prospective study (NCT02872662) enrolled patients with MDS, MDS/MPN or MDS-AML with < 30% marrow blasts undergoing HCT. Patients were included before HCT, and serial bone marrow (BM) samples were collected every third month post-HCT for 2 years. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected monthly. MRD results were not available for the treating physician. Results: We screened 286 pts between 2016 and 2020, whereof 20 were excluded mainly due to lack of genetic aberration or no HCT performed. 266 pts were included from 12 HCT centers. Median age was 64 (18-78) years and 59% were male. Myeloid panel NGS screening identified a median of 2 (0-9) mutations. The most common mutations were TET2 (n=85), ASXL1 (n=73) and SRSF2 (n=59). Median time of follow up was 886 (4-1934) days. Sixty pts relapsed after a median of 189 (53-1281) days and 46 died due to non-relapse mortality after a median of 121 (4-1036) days. Remaining pts (n=160) were in continuous complete remission (CCR) after a median follow-up of 1053 (479-1934) days. Estimated 1 and 2y overall survival was 79%, and 71%, respectively, while estimated 1 and 2y relapse-free survival (RFS) was 75% and 66%, respectively. MRD data was missing in 46 pts; no post-HCT samples available (n=15), no mutation detected (n=14) and difficulties to design ddPCR primers (n=11). 221 pts were available for MRD analysis with a median number of 4 (0-13) and 5 (0-23) samples from BM and PB, respectively. Of 53 clinical relapses with MRD results available, 42 were preceded by pos MRD (>0.1%) with a median of 70 (range 20-425) days between first pos MRD and clinical relapse. For the 11 remaining pts, 8 were inadequately sampled with a median time of 189 (82-397) days between last sampling and clinical relapse. One patient had an extramedullary relapse only. Of 31 pts who died without relapse, 19 were consistently MRD neg, while 5 were borderline positive (MRD > 0.1% and <0.5%) during the first 100 days but negative thereafter. Four MRD+ patients died without clinical relapse. Three pts were initially MRD+ but turned negative, all of which had chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Of 136 CCR patients, 94 were consistently MRD neg; 26 were borderline pos (MRD > 0.1% and <0.5%) during the first 100 days followed by neg samples; 16 were MRD positive (either > 0.5% during the first 100d or > 0.1% after 100d) of which 10 had a transition from pos to neg samples (all had cGVHD); one patient was treated for a molecular relapse detected by clinical routine method (FISH) and five patients were MRD positive at time of last follow-up. MRD used as a time-dependent co-variate was negatively associated with RFS (HR 7.1, p<0.01). Estimated cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality 2y after pos MRD was 60% and 7% respectively (see figure).

  {"id":"toksvang_maintenance_2022","abstract":"Maintenance therapy (MT) with oral methotrexate (MTX) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is essential for the cure of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MTX and 6-MP interfere with nucleotide synthesis and salvage pathways. The primary cytotoxic mechanism involves the incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) into DNA (as DNA-TG), which may be enhanced by the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis by other MTX/6-MP metabolites. Co-medication during MT is common. Although Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis appears safe, the benefit of glucocorticosteroid/vincristine pulses in improving survival and of allopurinol to moderate 6-MP pharmacokinetics remains uncertain. Numerous genetic polymorphisms influence the pharmacology, efficacy, and toxicity (mainly myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity) of MTX and thiopurines. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (encoded by TPMT) decreases TGNs but increases methylated 6-MP metabolites (MeMPs); similarly, nudix hydrolase 15 (encoded by NUDT15) also decreases TGNs available for DNA incorporation. Loss-of-function variants in both genes are currently used to guide MT, but do not fully explain the inter-patient variability in thiopurine toxicity. Because of the large inter-individual variations in MTX/6-MP bioavailability and metabolism, dose adjustments are traditionally guided by the degree of myelosuppression, but this does not accurately reflect treatment intensity. DNA-TG is a common downstream metabolite of MTX/6-MP combination chemotherapy, and a higher level of DNA-TG has been associated with a lower relapse hazard, leading to the development of the Thiopurine Enhanced ALL Maintenance (TEAM) strategy‚Äîthe addition of low-dose (2.5‚Äì12.5‚Äâmg/m2/day) 6-thioguanine to the 6-MP/MTX backbone‚Äîthat is currently being tested in a randomized ALLTogether1 trial (EudraCT: 2018-001795-38). Mutations in the thiopurine and MTX metabolism pathways, and in the mismatch repair genes have been identified in early ALL relapses, providing valuable insights to assist the development of strategies to detect imminent relapse, to facilitate relapse salvage therapy, and even to bring about changes in frontline ALL therapy to mitigate this relapse risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Toksvang","given":"Linea N."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Shawn H.

Eleven additional patients were enrolled in the dose-expansion phase. Overall response rate (ORR) was 66% (48% CR; 17% PR); 52% patients underwent HDC-ASCT. An ORR of 85% was observed in patients with nongerminal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) DLBCL compared with only 13% in those with GCB DLBCL.

  {"id":"tosetto_how_2015","abstract":"Type 2 von Willebrand disease (VWD) includes a wide range of qualitative abnormalities of von Willebrand factor structure and function resulting in a variable bleeding tendency. According to the current classification, 4 different subtypes can be identified, each with distinctive phenotypic and therapeutic characteristics. Current available laboratory methods allow a straightforward approach to VWD subtyping, and although the precise molecular characterization remains complex, it is not required for appropriate treatment of the vast majority of cases. Desmopressin can be useful only in a few type 2 cases compared with patients with actual quantitative deficiency (type 1), most often in variants with a nearly normal multimeric pattern (type 2M). However, since no laboratory test accurately predicts response to desmopressin, a trial test should always be performed in all type 2 VWD patients, with the exception of type 2B ones. Replacement therapy with plasma-derived von Willebrand factor-factor VIII concentrates represents the safe mainstay of treatment of all patients, particularly those not responding to desmopressin or requiring a sustained hemostatic correction because of major surgery or bleeding. A significant patient bleeding history correlates with increased bleeding risk and should be considered in tailoring the optimal antihemorrhagic prophylaxis in the individual patient.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tosetto","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Castaman","given":"Giancarlo"}],"citation-key":"tosetto_how_2015","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2014-08-551960","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,5]]},"language":"en","page":"907-914","source":"Silverchair","title":"How I treat type 2 variant forms of von willebrand disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2014-08-551960","volume":"125"},

The cumulative neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin often requires therapy to be stopped in patients who are still responding. This study evaluates a new strategy of intermittent oxaliplatin treatment that is based on FOLFOX7, a simplified leucovorin and fluorouracil regimen with high-dose oxaliplatin.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients were randomly assigned to either FOLFOX4 administered every 2 weeks until progression (arm A) or FOLFOX7 for six cycles, maintenance without oxaliplatin for 12 cycles, and reintroduction of FOLFOX7 (arm B).\nRESULTS: Six hundred twenty patients were enrolled, including an exploratory cohort of 95 elderly or poor prognosis patients. Median progression-free survival and survival times were 9.0 and 19.3 months, respectively, in patients allocated to arm A compared with 8.7 and 21.2 months, respectively, in patients allocated to arm B (P = not significant). Response rates were 58.5% with arm A and 59.2% with arm B. National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed in 54.4% of the patients in arm A v 48.7% of patients in arm B.

  {"id":"trabolsi_bispecific_2024","abstract":"Despite recent advances in frontline therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), at least a third of those diagnosed still will require second or further lines for relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) disease. A small minority of these can be cured with standard chemoimmunotherapy/stem-cell transplant salvage approaches. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-19) therapies are increasingly altering the prognostic landscape for rel/ref patients with DLBCL and related aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Long-term follow up data show ongoing disease-free outcomes consistent with cure in 30‚Äì40% after CAR-19, including high-risk patients primary refractory to or relapsing within 1 year of frontline treatment. This has made CAR-19 a preferred option for these difficult-to-treat populations. Widespread adoption, however, remains challenged by logistical and patient-related hurdles, including a requirement for certified tertiary care centers concentrated in urban centers, production times of at least 3‚Äì4 weeks, and high per-patients costs similar to allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are molecular biotherapies designed to bind and activate effector T-cells and drive them to B-cell antigens, leading to a similar cellular-dependent cytotoxicity as CAR-19. May and June of 2023 saw initial approvals of next-generation BsAbs glofitamab and epcoritamab in DLBCL as third or higher-line therapy, or for patients ineligible for CAR-19. BsAbs have similar spectrum but generally reduced severity of immune related side effects as CAR-19 and can be administered in community settings without need to manufacture patient-specific cellular products. To date and in contrast to CAR-19, however, there is no convincing evidence of cure after BsAbs monotherapy, though follow up is limited. The role of BsAbs in DLBCL treatment is rapidly evolving with trials investigating use in both relapsed and frontline curative-intent combinations. The future of DLBCL treatment is bound increasingly to include effector cell mediated immunotherapies, but further optimization of both cellular and BsAb approaches is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Trabolsi","given":"Asaad"},{"family":"Arumov","given":"Artavazd"},{"family":"Schatz","given":"Jonathan H."}],"citation-key":"trabolsi_bispecific_2024","container-title":"Blood Cancer Journal","container-title-short":"Blood Cancer J.","DOI":"10.1038/s41408-024-00997-w","ISSN":"2044-5385","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"language":"en","license":"2024 The Author(s)","page":"1-10","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Bispecific antibodies and CAR-T cells: dueling immunotherapies for large B-cell lymphomas","title-short":"Bispecific antibodies and CAR-T cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-024-00997-w","volume":"14"},

Despite improvements in medical therapies, particularly with the implementation of novel drugs targeting homologous recombination deficiency, the survival rates of patients with EOC remain low. Unlike other neoplasms, EOC remains relatively insensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is correlated with a tumor microenvironment (TME) characterized by poor infiltration by immune cells and active immunosuppression dominated by immune components with tumor-¬≠promoting properties, especially tumor-¬≠associated macrophages (TAMs). In recent years, TAMs have attracted interest as potential therapeutic targets by seeking to reverse the immunosuppression in the TME and enhance the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy. Here, we review the key biological features of TAMs that affect tumor progression and their relevance as potential targets for treating EOC. We especially focus on the therapies that might modulate the recruitment, polarization, survival, and functional properties of TAMs in the TME of EOC that can be harnessed to develop superior combinatorial regimens with immunotherapy for the clinical care of patients with EOC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Truxova","given":"Iva"},{"family":"Cibula","given":"David"},{"family":"Spisek","given":"Radek"},{"family":"Fucikova","given":"Jitka"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"truxova_targeting_2023","container-title":"Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer","container-title-short":"J Immunother Cancer","DOI":"10.1136/jitc-2022-005968","ISSN":"2051-1426","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"e005968","PMCID":"PMC9950980","PMID":"36822672","source":"12.469","title":"Targeting tumor-associated macrophages for successful immunotherapy of ovarian carcinoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jitc.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jitc-2022-005968","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"tsimberidou_molecular_2023","abstract":"Over the past 15 years, rapid progress has been made in developmental therapeutics, especially regarding the use of matched targeted therapies against specific oncogenic molecular alterations across cancer types. Molecular tumour boards (MTBs) are panels of expert physicians, scientists, health-care providers and patient advocates who review and interpret molecular-profiling results for individual patients with cancer and match each patient to available therapies, which can include investigational drugs. Interpretation of the molecular alterations found in each patient is a complicated task that requires an understanding of their contextual functional effects and their correlations with sensitivity or resistance to specific treatments. The criteria for determining the actionability of molecular alterations and selecting matched treatments are constantly evolving. Therefore, MTBs have an increasingly necessary role in optimizing the allocation of biomarker-directed therapies and the implementation of precision oncology. Ultimately, increased MTB availability, accessibility and performance are likely to improve patient care. The challenges faced by MTBs are increasing, owing to the plethora of identifiable molecular alterations and immune markers in tumours of individual patients and their evolving clinical significance as more and more data on patient outcomes and results from clinical trials become available. Beyond next-generation sequencing, broader biomarker analyses can provide useful information. However, greater funding, resources and expertise are needed to ensure the sustainability of MTBs and expand their outreach to underserved populations. Harmonization between practice and policy will be required to optimally implement precision oncology.

  {"id":"tsuji_randomized_2021","abstract":"3501\n\nBackground: Triplet regimens, FOLFOXIRI, combined with bevacizumab (bev) or panitumumab have been shown to be superior in terms of early tumor shrinkage (ETS) and depth of response (DpR) compared to doublet combinations in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), in the TRIBE trial (N Engl J Med 2014) or the VOLFI trial (J Clin Oncol 2019), respectively. There have been few studies which directly compared cetuximab (cet) with bev when combined with triplet regimen. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of bev vs. cet in combination with FOLFOXIRI in previously untreated mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumors. Methods: This trial was a randomized phase II trial to evaluate modified (m)-FOLFOXIRI (irinotecan 150mg/m2, oxaliplatin 85mg/m2, 5-FU 2400mg/m2) plus cet vs. bev as first-line treatment in terms of DpR during the entire course as the primary endpoint in 360 patients with RAS wild-type mCRC. The aim of the trial was to show that median DpR of cet arm was more than 12.5% higher than bev arm, with a power of 85% at a significance level of 0.05. Secondary endpoints included ETS rate at week 8, overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), secondary resection rate, and toxicity. Results: A total of 359 patients were enrolled between July 2015 and June 2019. For the full analysis set (median age 65y, 64% male, PS0/1: 91%/9%, left/right primary: 83%/17%), 173 and 175 patients were randomly assigned to the cet and bev arms, respectively. On the cutoff date of September 2020, the median number of cycles administered was 10 (range, 1-51) for the cet arm and 12 (range, 1-51) for the bev arm. Safety data was already reported at the ASCO GI symposium 2021 (J Clin Oncol 39, 2021 suppl 3; abstr 86). The primary endpoint was met (p =.001); 57.4%Ôºà-15.0ÃÉ100Ôºâfor the cet arm versus 46.0% Ôºà-0.6ÃÉ100Ôºâfor the bev arm. As for primary tumor sidedness, median DpR were 60.3% versus 46.1% (p =.0007) in the left-side and 50.0% versus 41.2% (p =.46) in the right-side. The ETS rate and ORR as the secondary endpoints were 77.8% and 69.1% in the cet arm versus 74.6% and 71.7% in the bev arm, respectively, with no statistical significance. Although the survival data were immature, PFS and OS of both arms were 12.7 months (95%CI 11.5-14.0) and 37.6 months (95%CI 30.8 to 43.0), respectively.

  {"id":"u_cancer_2018","abstract":"Cancer patients have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), a condition that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although risk assessment tools have been developed, it is still very challenging to predict which cancer patients will suffer from VTE. The scope of this review is to summarize and discuss studies focusing on the link between genetic alterations and risk of cancer-¬≠associated thrombosis (CAT). Thus far, classical risk factors that contribute to VTE have been tried as risk factors of CAT, with low success. In support, hypercoagulant plasma profiles in patients with CAT differ from those with only VTE, indicating other risk factors that contribute to VTE in cancer. As germline mutations do not significantly contribute to elevated risk of VTE, somatic mutations in tumors may significantly associate with and contribute to CAT. As it is very time-¬≠consuming to investigate each and every mutation, an unbiased approach is warranted. In this light we discuss our own recent unbiased proof-¬≠of-¬≠principle study using RNA sequencing in isolated colorectal cancer cells. Our work has uncovered candidate genes that associate with VTE in colorectal cancer, and these gene profiles associated with VTE more significantly than classical parameters such as platelet counts, D-¬≠dimer, and P-¬≠selectin levels. Genes associated with VTE could be linked to pathways being involved in coagulation, inflammation and methionine degradation. We conclude that tumor cell-¬≠ specific gene expression profiles and/or mutational status has superior potential as predictors of VTE in cancer patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"√ú","given":"nl√º Bet√ºl"},{"family":"V","given":"ersteeg Henri H."}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"u_cancer_2018","container-title":"Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis","container-title-short":"Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis","DOI":"10.1002/rth2.12143","ISSN":"24750379","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"en","page":"622-629","source":"5.953","title":"Cancer‚Äêassociated thrombosis: The search for the holy grail continues","title-short":"Cancer‚Äêassociated thrombosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2475037922018568","volume":"2"},

Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the C797S/T790M/activating-mutation (triple-mutation)-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance. In the present study, we identify brigatinib to be effective against triple-mutation-harbouring cells in vitro and in vivo. Our original computational simulation demonstrates that brigatinib fits into the ATP-binding pocket of triple-mutant EGFR. The structure-activity relationship analysis reveals the key component in brigatinib to inhibit the triple-mutant EGFR. The efficacy of brigatinib is enhanced markedly by combination with anti-EGFR antibody because of the decrease of surface and total EGFR expression.

  {"id":"ullas_biomarker_2020","abstract":"Background: Biomarker-driven lung adenocarcinomas involving alterations in oncogenic drivers such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and NTRK have witnessed a dramatic shift in the therapeutic and prognostic landscape owing to the development of molecular targeted therapies. The recent approval of the selective RET inhibitor, selpercatinib, has led to an ardent interest in RET-rearranged non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, sequential single-gene testing cannot detect RET rearrangements accurately or characterize the fusion partners. Objectives: We aimed to determine the incidence and types of RET alterations in our patients with NSCLC, and to describe the demographic and clinical profile of our patients with RET-driven NSCLC. In addition, our aim was to highlight the advantages of broader panel-based testing by the next generation sequencing (NGS) over single-gene assays. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective, case series of patients with advanced NSCLC who underwent testing by NGS between December 2018 and August 2020 at our center, with a focus on the cases who were found to have the RET gene rearrangement. The demographic, clinicopathological profiles, and treatment details were retrieved from the medical record archives. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 23 for Windows. Results: A total of 169 patients were enrolled in the study. RET rearrangement was detected in 2.9% (n = 5) of the patients in our cohort. Four cases had the KIF5B-RET fusion, and one case had the CCDC6-RET fusion. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 45ÔøΩÔøΩ82), with a slight female preponderance (men: 2 and women: 3). The RET fusions were detected using an NGS-based assay. Four out of the five patients were administered pemetrexed-carboplatin-based chemotherapy and are alive and on regular follow-up. One patient did not receive any treatment and has succumbed to the disease. One patient has been administered selpercatinib after failing many lines of chemotherapy. Conclusions: The emergence of newer molecular targets necessitates the use of an broader panel-based NGS testing to detect oncogene addiction in NSCLC. This case series highlights the importance of NGS-based testing in the light of the recent approval of selpercatinib for RET-rearranged NSCLC.","author":[{"family":"Ullas","given":""},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Mansi"},{"family":"Nathany","given":"Shrinidhi"},{"family":"Soni","given":"Satyajeet"},{"family":"Bansal","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Parveen"},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Anurag Batra"}],"citation-key":"ullas_biomarker_2020","container-title":"Cancer Research, Statistics, and Treatment","container-title-short":"Cancer Res.

  {"id":"ullas_ihc_2021","abstract":"Aims Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a distinct molecular subtype and rapid approval of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has necessitated rapid and sensitive diagnostic modalities for the detection of this alteration. Gene rearrangements can be identified using many techniques including fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), reverse transcriptase-PCR, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for fusion oncoprotein expression. We aimed to determine the concordance between IHC, FISH and NGS for ALK biomarker detection, and determine differences in sensitivity, and survival outcomes. Methods We analysed the concordance between IHC using D5F3 monoclonal antibody, FISH (break-apart) and NGS using a custom panel containing 71 different ALK variants. Results Among 71 cases included in this study, FISH was evaluable in 58 cases. The concordance of ALK IHC with FISH was 75.9% and that with NGS was 84.5%. The sensitivities of FISH and NGS were 75.6% and 87.5%, respectively. The median progression-free survival of ALK IHC-positive and FISH-negative group was 5.5 months and that of both positive was 9.97 months.

Despite much promising research currently being undertaken, particularly in imaging, the literature as a whole lacks transparency, clear reporting to facilitate replicability, exploration for potential ethical concerns, and clear demonstrations of effectiveness. Among the many reasons why these problems exist, one of the most important (for which we provide a preliminary solution here) is the current lack of best practice guidance specific to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

We studied the effect of adding the novel antiangiogenic agent aflibercept (also known as ziv-aflibercept in the United States) to FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC previously treated with oxaliplatin, including patients who received prior bevacizumab.\n            \n            \n              Patients and Methods\n              Patients were randomly assigned to receive aflibercept (4 mg/kg intravenously; 612 patients) or placebo (614 patients) every 2 weeks in combination with FOLFIRI.

  {"id":"vancutsem_openlabel_2007","abstract":"PURPOSE: Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We compared the activity of panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) to that of BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had progressed after standard chemotherapy.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 463 patients with 1% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, measurable disease, and radiologic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months of most recent chemotherapy to panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus BSC (n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Tumor assessments by blinded central review were scheduled from week 8 until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, overall survival (OS), and safety. BSC patients who progressed could receive panitumumab in a cross-over study.\nRESULTS: Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P < .0001]). Median PFS time was 8 weeks (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.4) for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks (95% CI, 7.1 to 7.7) for BSC. Mean (standard error) PFS time was 13.8 (0.8) weeks for panitumumab and 8.5 (0.5) weeks for BSC. Objective response rates also favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10% for panitumumab and 0% for BSC (P < .0001). No difference was observed in OS (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.22), which was confounded by similar activity of panitumumab after 76% of BSC patients entered the cross-over study. Panitumumab was well tolerated. Skin toxicities, hypomagnesaemia, and diarrhea were the most common toxicities observed.

  {"id":"vancutsem_oral_2004","abstract":"This study evaluates the efficacy of capecitabine using data from a large, well-characterised population of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated in two identically designed phase III studies. A total of 1207 patients with previously untreated mCRC were randomised to either oral capecitabine (1250 mg m(-2) twice daily, days 1-14 every 21 days; n=603) or intravenous (i.v.) bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV; Mayo Clinic regimen; n=604). Capecitabine demonstrated a statistically significant superior response rate compared with 5-FU/LV (26 vs 17%; P<0.0002). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that capecitabine consistently resulted in superior response rates (P<0.05), even in patient subgroups with poor prognostic indicators. The median time to response and duration of response were similar and time to progression (TTP) was equivalent in the two arms (hazard ratio (HR) 0.997, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.885-1.123, P=0.95; median 4.6 vs 4.7 months with capecitabine and 5-FU/LV, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified younger age, liver metastases, multiple metastases and poor Karnofsky Performance Status as independent prognostic indicators for poor TTP. Overall survival was equivalent in the two arms (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84-1.06, P=0.48; median 12.9 vs 12.8 months, respectively). Capecitabine results in superior response rate, equivalent TTP and overall survival, an improved safety profile and improved convenience compared with i.v. 5-FU/LV as first-line treatment for MCRC. For patients in whom fluoropyrimidine monotherapy is indicated, capecitabine should be strongly considered. Following encouraging results from phase I and II trials, randomised trials are evaluating capecitabine in combination with irinotecan, oxaliplatin and radiotherapy. Capecitabine is a suitable replacement for i.v. 5-FU as the backbone of colorectal cancer therapy.","author":[{"family":"Van Cutsem","given":"E."},{"family":"Hoff","given":"P.

  {"id":"vanita_alk_2016","abstract":"Objectives To evaluate the performance and treatment profile of advanced EML4ÔøΩ®ÄûLK positive Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in a developing country with potentially restricted access to Crizotinib. Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis of advanced ALK positive NSCLC patients who were treated from June 2012 to September 2015 was conducted. The primary goal was to evaluate outcomes of advanced ALK positive NSCLC in our practice and examine the logistic constraints in procuring Crizotinib. Results 94 patients were available for analysis. 21 (22.3%) patients were started on Crizotinib upfront, 60 (63.8%) on chemotherapy, 10 (10.6%) on Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (in view of poor PS) and 3 (3.2%) patients were offered best supportive care. Reasons for not starting Crizotinib upfront included symptomatic patients needing early initiation of therapy (23.3%), ALK not tested upfront (23.3%) and financial constraints (21.9%). 69 patients (73.4%) received Crizotinib at some stage during treatment. Dose interruptions (> 1 week) with Crizotinib were seen in 20 patients (29%), with drug toxicity being the commonest reason (85%). Median Progression free survival (PFS) on first line therapy for the entire cohort was 10 months, with a significant difference between patients receiving Crizotinib and those who did not ever receive Crizotinib (10 months vs. 2 months, p = 0.028). Median Overall Survival (OS) was not reached for the entire cohort, with 1 year survival being 81.2%. Patients with an ECOG Performance Status (PS) of >2 had a significantly reduced PFS compared to patients with PS < = 2 (1.5 months vs. 11 months, p< 0.001). 47 patients with financial constraints (68.1%) received Crizotinib completely free via various extramural support schemes. Conclusion A majority of our ALK positive NSCLC patients were exposed to Crizotinib through the help of various support mechanisms and these patients had similar outcomes to that reported from previously published literature.","author":[{"family":"Vanita","given":""},{"family":"Ramaswamy","given":"Anant"},{"family":"Patil","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Joshi","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Chougule","given":"Anuradha"},{"family":"Kane","given":"Subhadha"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Rajiv"},{"family":"Sahu","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Doshi","given":"Vipul"},{"family":"Nayak","given":"Lingaraj"},{"family":"Mahajan","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Janu","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Prabhash","given":"Kumar Noronha"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"vanita_alk_2016","container-title":"PloS one","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0160752","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"e0160752-NA","source":"3.7","title":"ALK Positive Lung Cancer: Clinical Profile, Practice and Outcomes in a Developing Country","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"vanstein_hyperthermic_2021","abstract":"The peritoneal surface is a common site of disease in ovarian and colorectal cancer. Peritoneal metastases carry a poor prognosis, despite maximal therapeutic efforts, including surgical removal of tumor deposits and intravenous chemotherapy. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a single intraoperative procedure that delivers chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity, leading to high intracellular drug concentration at the peritoneal surface. This review describes the current knowledge regarding the mechanism of action, safety, and efficacy of HIPEC in the treatment of peritoneal metastases from epithelial ovarian and colorectal cancers and explores current knowledge gaps.Toxic effects of HIPEC are limited. Evidence from a randomized trial shows improved recurrence-free and overall survival after HIPEC in patients with ovarian cancer who are ineligible for primary cytoreductive surgery (CRS). The effect of HIPEC for patients with ovarian cancer undergoing primary CRS or CRS for recurrent disease has not yet been determined, and results of ongoing trials must be awaited. A recent study in patients with peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer did not show a benefit of HIPEC when added to perioperative chemotherapy.Based on available evidence, various international guidelines include the option to add HIPEC to interval CRS for patients with stage III ovarian cancer. The role of HIPEC in colorectal cancer is less well defined. Future studies will need to tailor patient selection, timing, and optimal regimens of HIPEC to improve the effectiveness of this specialized treatment in ovarian, colorectal, and other tumor types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Stein","given":"Ruby M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Aalbers","given":"Arend G.

  {"id":"vedovati_direct_2015","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs) have been shown to be as effective and at least as safe as conventional anticoagulation for the prevention of recurrences in patients with VTE. Whether this is the case in patients with cancer-associated VTE remains undefined.\nMETHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with the aim of assessing the efficacy and safety of DOAs in patients with VTE and cancer. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched up to December 2013 with no language restriction. The primary outcome of the analysis was recurrent VTE. Data on major bleeding (MB) and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were analyzed. Data were pooled and compared by ORs and 95% CIs.\nRESULTS: Overall, 10 studies comparing DOAs with conventional anticoagulation for treatment of VTE including patients with cancer were included in the review. Six studies were included in the meta-analysis (two with dabigatran, two with rivaroxaban, one with edoxaban, and one with apixaban), accounting for a total of 1,132 patients. VTE recurred in 23 of 595 (3.9%) and in 32 of 537 (6.0%) patients with cancer treated with DOAs and conventional treatment, respectively (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.37-1.10; I2, 0%). MB occurred in 3.2% and 4.2% of patients receiving DOAs and conventional treatment, respectively (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.41-1.44; I2, 0%).\nCONCLUSIONS: DOAs seem to be as effective and safe as conventional treatment for the prevention of VTE in patients with cancer. Further clinical trials in patients with cancer-associated VTE should be performed to confirm these results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vedovati","given":"Maria Cristina"},{"family":"Germini","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Agnelli","given":"Giancarlo"},{"family":"Becattini","given":"Cecilia"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"vedovati_direct_2015","container-title":"Chest","container-title-short":"Chest","DOI":"10.1378/chest.14-0402","ISSN":"00123692","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2]]},"language":"en","page":"475-483","source":"10.262","title":"Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With VTE and Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012369215301823","volume":"147"},
  {"id":"vedovati_venous_2019","abstract":"Approximately one-fifth of all cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) are related to cancer and anticoagulant treatment in these patients has remained a challenge. Cancer patients with VTE are at increased risk of developing recurrent VTE compared to patients without cancer, but also have a higher risk of major bleeding. In these patients, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be more effective and as safe as vitamin K-antagonists (VKAs) for the treatment of VTE. Therefore, the majority of current clinical guidelines recommend LMWHs as the treatment of choice for cancer-associated VTE. However, several issues should be considered regarding the use of LMWHs as daily subcutaneous injections, the costs or risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In recent years, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have shown similar efficacy and better safety profile compared to VKAs and have become the standard of care for the treatment of VTE in the general population. Because DOACs offer a simple oral treatment regimen without the need for anticoagulation control, they could be an attractive alternative to LMWH.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Vedovati","given":"Maria Cristina"},{"family":"Giustozzi","given":"Michela"},{"family":"Becattini","given":"Cecilia"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"vedovati_venous_2019","container-title":"Thrombosis Research","container-title-short":"Thrombosis Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.thromres.2019.02.031","ISSN":"00493848","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"language":"en","page":"33-41","source":"10.407","title":"Venous thromboembolism and cancer: Current and future role of direct-acting oral anticoagulants","title-short":"Venous thromboembolism and cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049384819300763","volume":"177"},
  {"id":"venook_calgb_2014","abstract":"LBA3\n\nBackground: Irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin (FOLFIRI) or oxaliplatin/5-FU/leucovorin (mFOLFOX6), combined with bevacizumab (BV) or cetuximab (CET), are first-line treatments for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum (MCRC). The optimal antibody combination is unknown. Methods: Patients (pts) with KRAS wild-type (wt)(codons 12 and 13) MCRC and performance status 0-1 received FOLFIRI or mFOLFOX6 (MD/pt choice at enrollment) and randomized to either CET 400 mg/m2 X 1, then 250 mg/m2 qw or BV 5 mg/kg q2w. The original study included unselected MCRC pts receiving FOLFIRI or mFOLFOX6 and randomized to CET, BV, or both. After 1,420 pts accrued the study amended as follows: only pts with KRAS wt tumors (codon 12 and 13) were included and the combination CET + BV arm was deleted. Rx continued until progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, curative surgery; treatment holidays of 4 wks permitted. Subsequent Rx not mandated. Accrual goal was 1,142 pts. One¬∞ endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: Between November 2005 and March 2012, 3,058 unselected pts enrolled, 2,334 KRAS wt pts randomized; final N =1137 (333 pre-amend eligible retrospective KRAS test, 804 post-amend), median f/u = 24 mos; Median age ‚Äì 59 y; 61% male. Chemo/BV ‚Äì 559; chemo/CET ‚Äì 578. FOLFIRI = 26.6%, mFOLFOX6 = 73.4%. OS analysis planned at 849 events; efficacy futility boundary crossed at 10th interim analysis on 1/29/14. OS - chemo/BV v. chemo/CET = 29.04 (25.66 - 31.21) v. 29.93 (27.56 - 31.21) mos; HR = 0.92 (0.78, 1.09) (p value = 0.34). PFS (by investigator): chemo/BV v. chemo/CET: 10.84 (9.86 - 11.4) v. 10.45 (9.66 - 11.33) mos. There were 94 pts free of disease following surgery, median f/u 40 mos (range 8.0 - 86.0). Outcomes similar by gender. On-study toxicity and deaths as expected. Analyses underway: Expanded RAS, FOLFOX v. FOLFIRI, subsequent therapies, long-term survivors, correlates. Conclusions: Chemo/CET and chemo/BV equivalent in OS in pts KRAS wt (codons 12 + 13) MCRC; either is appropriate in first line. Overall OS of 29 + mos and 8% long-term survivors confirms progress in MCRC. The preference for FOLFOX limits chemotherapy comparison. Expanded RAS and other molecular and clinical analyses may identify subsets of pts who get more or less benefit from specific regimens.

  {"id":"vercellino_predictive_2020","abstract":"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as an option for relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas that have failed 2 lines of therapy. Failures usually occur early after infusion. The purpose of our study was to identify factors that may predict failure, particularly early progression (EP), within the first month after infusion. Characteristics of 116 patients were analyzed at the time of decision (TD) to use commercial CAR (axicabtagene ciloleucel, n = 49; tisagenlecleucel n = 67) and at the time of treatment (TT), together with total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) at TT. With a median follow-up of 8.2 months, 55 patients failed treatment; 27 (49%) were early progressors. The estimated 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 47.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0-58.6) and 67.0% (95% CI, 57-79), respectively. Univariate analyses for PFS and OS identified Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) ‚â•2, stage III/IV disease, extranodal (EN) sites ‚â•2, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased C-reactive protein (CRP), high International Prognostic Index at TD and at TT, as well as increased CRP, bulky mass, and high TMTV at TT, as risk factors. Multivariate analyses for PFS, EP, and OS identified elevated LDH and EN sites ‚â•2 at TD and the same predictors at TT (ie, increased CRP, EN sites ‚â•2, and TMTV >80 mL). In summary, risk factors identified for early progression at TD and at TT were EN involvement (‚â•2 sites) and lymphoma burden (LDH, TMTV).","author":[{"family":"Vercellino","given":"Laetitia"},{"family":"Di Blasi","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Kanoun","given":"Salim"},{"family":"Tessoulin","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Cedric"},{"family":"D'Aveni-Piney","given":"Maud"},{"family":"Ob√©ric","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Bodet-Milin","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Bories","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Olivier","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Lafon","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Berriolo-Riedinger","given":"Alina"},{"family":"Galli","given":"Eugenio"},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Rubio","given":"Marie-Th√©r√®se"},{"family":"Bossard","given":"Celine"},{"family":"Meignin","given":"Veronique"},{"family":"Merlet","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Feugier","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Le Gouill","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Ysebaert","given":"Loic"},{"family":"Casasnovas","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Meignan","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Chevret","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Thieblemont","given":"Catherine"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"vercellino_predictive_2020","container-title":"Blood Advances","container-title-short":"Blood Adv","DOI":"10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003001","ISSN":"2473-9537","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,24]]},"language":"eng","page":"5607-5615","PMCID":"PMC7686887","PMID":"33180899","source":"7.637","title":"Predictive factors of early progression after CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"vicente_eltrombopag_2020","abstract":"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal myeloid disorders characterized by cytopenia and a propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The management of lower-risk (LR) MDS with persistent cytopenias remains suboptimal. Eltrombopag (EPAG), a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, can improve platelet counts in LR-MDS and tri-lineage hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia (AA). We conducted a phase 2 dose modification study to investigate the safety and efficacy of EPAG in LR-MDS. EPAG dose was escalated from 50 mg/day, to a maximum of 150 mg/day over a period of 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was hematologic response at 16-20 weeks. Eleven of 25 (44%) patients responded; five and six patients had uni- or bi-lineage hematologic responses, respectively. The predictors of response were presence of a PNH clone, marrow hypocellularity, thrombocytopenia with or without other cytopenia, and elevated plasma thrombopoietin levels at study entry. The safety profile was consistent with previous EPAG studies in AA; no patients discontinued drug due to adverse events. Three patients developed reversible grade-3 liver toxicity and one patient had increased reticulin fibrosis. Ten patients discontinued EPAG after achieving a robust response (median time 16 months); four of them reinitiated EPAG due to declining counts, and all attained a second robust response. Six patients had disease progression not associated with expansion of mutated clones and no patient progressed to AML on study. In conclusion, EPAG was well-tolerated and effective in restoring hematopoiesis in patients with low to intermediate-1 risk MDS.

Its use, both as a diagnostic tool and for hemodynamic monitoring, has increased markedly, influ‚Äëencing contemporary cardiorespiratory management. Recent studies suggest that the use of CCE may have a positive impact on outcomes. CCE may be used in critically ill patients in many different clinical situations, both in their early evaluation of in the emergency department and during intensive care unit (ICU) admission and stay. CCE has also proven its utility in perioperative settings, as well as in the management of mechanical circulatory support. CCE may be performed with very simple diagnostic objectives. This application, referred to as basic CCE, does not require a high level of training. Advanced CCE, on the other hand, uses ultrasonography for full evaluation of cardiac function and hemodynamics, and requires extensive training, with formal certification now available. Indeed, recent years have seen the creation of worldwide certification in advanced CCE. While transthoracic CCE remains the most commonly used method, the transesophageal route has gained importance, particularly for intubated and ventilated patients.\nConclusion:‚ÄÇ CCE is now widely accepted by the critical care community as a valuable tool in the ICU and emergency department, and in perioperative settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vieillard-Baron","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Millington","given":"S.

  {"id":"vittoria_alk_2015","abstract":"Introduction Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) gene rearrangement characterizes a subgroup of patients with lung adenocarcinoma who may benefit from ALK inhibitors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a break-apart/split-signal strategy is the gold standard to investigate ALK . The cutoff to define ALK positivity has been settled at 15% or greater. A subset of patients has ALK borderline status, showing 15% Á∞£ 5% positive cells. Several aspects, both biological and technical, might influence signals evaluation, making FISH interpretation a challenging task. To improve ALK evaluation, we classified the different FISH patterns on the basis of the type of the split signals, namely short, long, far away, and deleted. Methods We investigated ALK gene status by FISH in 244 lung adenocarcinomas and in a series of ALK negative cell lines samples, collected in three Institutions. Results ALK positive profile was found in 12% of patients; long, deleted, and far-away splits were the primary patterns observed. ALK borderline profile characterized 10% of samples; long and deleted splits were significantly more frequent in those borderline finally classified as ALK positive, whereas short split were mostly detected in those borderline patients finally classified as ALK negative ( p = 3.4 ÔøΩ 10 ÔøΩÔøΩ3 ). In the ALK negative control series, short split was the predominant pattern. Concordance was observed among different operators and probes for both samples and controls. Conclusions Difficulties in ALK FISH signal interpretation might be bypassed using this detailed scoring system, which is highly reproducible, helps clarify borderline samples (according to split type), and provides experimental evidence that 15% is a reasonable cutoff to overcome the assay-dependent background noise.","author":[{"family":"Vittoria","given":""},{"family":"Bernasconi","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Merlo","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Balzarini","given":"Piera"},{"family":"Vermi","given":"William"},{"family":"Riva","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Chiaravalli","given":"Anna Maria"},{"family":"Frattini","given":"Milo"},{"family":"Sahnane","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Facchetti","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Mazzucchelli","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Sessa","given":"Fausto"},{"family":"Tibiletti","given":"Maria Grazia Martin"}],"citation-key":"vittoria_alk_2015","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

Nonetheless, the exact mechanism by which haploinsufficiency results in erythroid failure, as well as the other clinical manifestations, remains uncertain. New knowledge regarding genetic and molecular mechanisms combined with robust clinical data from several international patient registries has provided important insights into the diagnosis of DBA and may, in the future, provide new treatments as well.

These diseases provide varying levels of resistance to malaria and are proposed to have emerged as an adaptive response to malaria in these regions. The transition to agriculture in the Holocene has been suggested to have influenced the selection for thalassemia in the Mediterranean as land clearance for farming encouraged interaction between Anopheles mosquitos, the vectors for malaria, and human groups. Here we document macroscopic and microscopic skeletal evidence for the presence of thalassemia in both hunter-gatherer (Con Co Ngua) and early agricultural (Man Bac) populations in northern Vietnam. Firstly, our findings demonstrate that thalassemia emerged prior to the transition to agriculture in Mainland Southeast Asia, from at least the early seventh millennium BP, contradicting a long-held assumption that agriculture was the main driver for an increase in malaria in Southeast Asia. Secondly, we describe evidence for significant malarial burden in the region during early agriculture. We argue that the introduction of farming into the region was not the initial driver of the selection for thalassemia, as it may have been in other regions of the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Vlok","given":"Melandri"},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Hallie R."},{"family":"Miszkiewicz","given":"Justyna J."},{"family":"Walker","given":"Meg M."},{"family":"Domett","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Willis","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Trinh","given":"Hiep H."},{"family":"Minh","given":"Tran T."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Mai Huong T."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Lan Cuong"},{"family":"Matsumura","given":"Hirofumi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tianyi"},{"family":"Nghia","given":"Huu T."},{"family":"Oxenham","given":"Marc F."}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"vlok_forager_2021","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-83978-4","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"5677","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"4.6","title":"Forager and farmer evolutionary adaptations to malaria evidenced by 7000 years of thalassemia in Southeast Asia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83978-4","volume":"11"},

Here, we show that a vaccine against ALK induced a strong and specific immune response that both prophylactically and therapeutically impaired the growth of ALK-positive lung tumors in mouse models. The ALK vaccine was efficacious also in combination with ALK TKI treatment and significantly delayed tumor relapses after TKI suspension. We found that lung tumors containing ALK rearrangements induced an immunosuppressive microenvironment, regulating the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of lung tumor cells. High PD-L1 expression reduced ALK vaccine efficacy, which could be restored by administration of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Thus, combinations of ALK vaccine with TKIs and immune checkpoint blockade therapies might represent a powerful strategy for the treatment of ALK-driven NSCLC.","author":[{"family":"Voena","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Menotti","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Mastini","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Di","given":"Giacomo Filomena"},{"family":"Longo","given":"Dario Livio"},{"family":"Castella","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Merlo","given":"Maria Elena Boggio"},{"family":"Ambrogio","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Minero","given":"Valerio Giacomo"},{"family":"Poggio","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Martinengo","given":"Cinzia"},{"family":"D'Amico","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Panizza","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Mologni","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Cavallo","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Altruda","given":"Fiorella"},{"family":"Butaney","given":"Mohit"},{"family":"Capelletti","given":"Marzia"},{"family":"Inghirami","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."},{"family":"Chiarle","given":"Roberto"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"voena_efficacy_2015","container-title":"Cancer immunology research","container-title-short":"Cancer Immunol.

Many studies comparing LMWH and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) found nonsignificant differences between therapies. A single study demonstrated that LMWHs are superior to VKAs. This evidence supporting LMWH for long-term VTE treatment in patients with cancer is based on comparison to VKA, but results are limited by methodological issues, and the benefit of LMWH may be driven by poor control. Subanalyses of DOAC trials suggest these are equally or more effective as VKA in cancer, but this conclusion is underpowered. Conclusion: DOACs have the potential to bypass many challenges with traditional therapy. After analyzing the evidence available, we conclude that after careful consideration of risks and benefits, use of DOACs for VTE treatment are a reasonable option in patients with cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vogel","given":"Samantha M."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Leticia V."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Evan J."}],"citation-key":"vogel_firstline_2020","container-title":"Journal of Pharmacy Practice","container-title-short":"Journal of Pharmacy Practice","DOI":"10.1177/0897190018775580","ISSN":"0897-1900, 1531-1937","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","page":"356-363","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"First-Line Therapies for VTE Treatment and Secondary Prophylaxis in Patients With Cancer: A New Direction","title-short":"First-Line Therapies for VTE Treatment and Secondary Prophylaxis in Patients With Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0897190018775580","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"vojnic_acquired_2019","abstract":"Abstract Introduction Multiple genetic mechanisms have been identified in EGFR-mutant lung cancers as mediators of acquired resistance (AR) to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but many cases still lack a known mechanism. Methods To identify novel mechanisms of AR, we performed targeted large panel sequencing of samples from 374 consecutive patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancer, including 174 post-TKI samples, of which 38 also had a matched pre-TKI sample. Alterations hypothesized to confer AR were introduced into drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines (H1975, HCC827, and PC9) by using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 genome editing. MSK-LX138cl, a cell line with EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) and praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 2 gene (PJA2)/BRAF fusion, was generated from an EGFR TKIÔøΩ©Çàesistant patient sample. Results We identified four patients (2.3%) with a BRAF fusion (three with acylglycerol kinase gene (AGK)/BRAF and one with PJA2/BRAF) in samples obtained at AR to EGFR TKI therapy (two posterlotinib samples and two posterlotinib and postosimertinib samples). Pre-TKI samples were available for two of four patients and both were negative for BRAF fusion. Induction of AGK/BRAF fusion in H1975 (L858R + T790M), PC9 (ex19del) and HCC827 (ex19del) cells increased phosphorylation of BRAF, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and conferred resistance to growth inhibition by osimertinib. MEK inhibition with trametinib synergized with osimertinib to block growth. Alternately, a pan-RAF inhibitor as a single agent blocked growth of all cell lines with mutant EGFR and BRAF fusion. Conclusion BRAF fusion is a mechanism of AR to EGFR TKI therapy in approximately 2% of patients. Combined inhibition of EGFR and MEK (with osimertinib and trametinib) or BRAF (with a pan-RAF inhibitor) are potential therapeutic strategies that should be explored.","author":[{"family":"Vojnic","given":"Morana"},{"family":"Kubota","given":"Daisuke"},{"family":"Kurzatkowski","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Offin","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Suzawa","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Benayed","given":"Ryma"},{"family":"Schoenfeld","given":"Adam J."},{"family":"Plodkowski","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Poirier","given":"John T."},{"family":"Rudin","given":"Charles M."},{"family":"Kris","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Neal X."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Helena A."},{"family":"Riely","given":"Gregory J."},{"family":"Arcila","given":"Maria E."},{"family":"Somwar","given":"Romel"},{"family":"Ladanyi","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"vojnic_acquired_2019","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"voulgari_epithelialmesenchymal_2009","abstract":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step during embryogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role in cancer progression, through which tissue epithelial cancers invade and metastasise. Cell characteristics are highly affected during EMT, resulting in altered cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, cell motility and invasiveness. Nevertheless, the demonstration of this process in human cancer has been proven difficult and controversial. Besides the fact that the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics is not a prerequisite for cell migration/invasion, it is a transient event that concerns only few cells in a tumour mass. The induction of EMT depends on the tumour type and its genetic alterations as well as on its interaction with the extracellular matrix. In parallel, trials for EMT identification in clinical samples lack of a widely accepted methodology, nomenclature and reliable markers. This review summarizes the main EMT characteristics and proposes methodologies for better analysis in vitro. It also highlights recent studies identifying cells with EMT characteristics in human cancer and proposes certain markers to identify them in tumour samples. Finally, it cites the recent literature concerning the mechanisms of drug resistance related to EMT in the context of anti-tumour therapies and proposes related new targets for therapy.","author":[{"family":"Voulgari","given":"Angeliki"},{"family":"Pintzas","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"voulgari_epithelialmesenchymal_2009","container-title":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","container-title-short":"Biochim.

The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor board recommendations for thoracic oncology patients regarding guideline adherence and transferal of recommendations into clinical practice.\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated tumor board recommendations of the thoracic oncology tumor board at Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) Hospital Munich between 2014 and 2016. We compared patient characteristics between guideline-adherent and non-guideline-adherent recommendations, as well as between transferred and non-transferred recommendations. We used multivariate logistic regression models to evaluate factors associated with guideline adherence.\n\nResults\nOver 90% of recommendations by the tumor board were either adherent to the guidelines (75.5%) or over fulfilling guidelines (15.6%). Almost 90% of recommendations were transferred to clinical practice. If a recommendation was not according to the guidelines, the reason was mostly associated with the general condition (age, Charlson comorbidity index, ECOG) of the patient or due to the patients‚Äô request. Surprisingly, sex also had a significant influence on the guideline adherence of recommendations, with females being more likely to get recommendations not according to the guidelines.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the results of this study are promising, as the guideline adherence of recommendations as well as the transferal of recommendations into clinical practice were high.

This therapy was approved on the basis of the single-arm phase II ZUMA-2 trial, which showed best overall and complete response rates of 91% and 68%, respectively. We report clinical outcomes with brexu-cel in the standard-of-care setting for the approved indication.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent leukapheresis between August 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, at 16 US institutions, with an intent to manufacture commercial brexu-cel for relapsed/refractory MCL, were included. Patient data were collected for analyses of responses, outcomes, and toxicities as per standard guidelines.\nRESULTS: Of 189 patients who underwent leukapheresis, 168 (89%) received brexu-cel infusion. Of leukapheresed patients, 79% would not have met ZUMA-2 eligibility criteria. Best overall and complete response rates were 90% and 82%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 14.3 months after infusion, the estimates for 6- and 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) were 69% (95% CI, 61 to 75) and 59% (95% CI, 51 to 66), respectively. The nonrelapse mortality was 9.1% at 1 year, primarily because of infections. Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity occurred in 8% and 32%, respectively. In univariable analysis, high-risk simplified MCL international prognostic index, high Ki-67, TP53 aberration, complex karyotype, and blastoid/pleomorphic variant were associated with shorter PFS after brexu-cel infusion. Patients with recent bendamustine exposure (within 24 months before leukapheresis) had shorter PFS and overall survival after leukapheresis in intention-to-treat univariable analysis.\nCONCLUSION: In the standard-of-care setting, the efficacy and toxicity of brexu-cel were consistent with those reported in the ZUMA-2 trial. Tumor-intrinsic features of MCL, and possibly recent bendamustine exposure, may be associated with inferior efficacy outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yucai"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Preetesh"},{"family":"Locke","given":"Frederick L."},{"family":"Maurer","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Frank","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Munoz","given":"Javier L."},{"family":"Dahiya","given":"Saurabh"},{"family":"Beitinjaneh","given":"Amer M."},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Miriam T."},{"family":"Mcguirk","given":"Joseph P."},{"family":"Vose","given":"Julie M."},{"family":"Goy","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Andreadis","given":"Charalambos"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Brian T."},{"family":"Dorritie","given":"Kathleen A."},{"family":"Oluwole","given":"Olalekan O."},{"family":"Deol","given":"Abhinav"},{"family":"Paludo","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Bijal"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Trent"},{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Rahul"},{"family":"Miklos","given":"David B."},{"family":"Rapoport","given":"Aaron P."},{"family":"Lekakis","given":"Lazaros"},{"family":"Ghobadi","given":"Armin"},{"family":"Neelapu","given":"Sattva S."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Jain","given":"Michael D."}],"citation-key":"wang_brexucabtagene_2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.22.01797","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"2594-2606","PMID":"36753699","source":"PubMed","title":"Brexucabtagene Autoleucel for Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma in Standard-of-Care Practice: Results From the US Lymphoma CAR T Consortium","title-short":"Brexucabtagene Autoleucel for Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma in Standard-of-Care Practice","type":"article-journal","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"wang_hypothesis_2023","abstract":"Inductive reasoning is a core problem-solving capacity: humans can identify underlying principles from a few examples, which can then be robustly generalized to novel scenarios. Recent work has evaluated large language models (LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding \"in context learning.\" This can work well for straightforward inductive tasks, but performs very poorly on more complex tasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we propose to improve the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating explicit hypotheses at multiple levels of abstraction: we prompt the LLM to propose multiple abstract hypotheses about the problem, in natural language, then implement the natural language hypotheses as concrete Python programs. These programs can be directly verified by running on the observed examples and generalized to novel inputs. Because of the prohibitive cost of generation with state-of-the-art LLMs, we consider a middle step to filter the set of hypotheses that will be implemented into programs: we either ask the LLM to summarize into a smaller set of hypotheses, or ask human annotators to select a subset of the hypotheses. We verify our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive reasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, and string transformation dataset SyGuS. On a random 40-problem subset of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves 27.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy of 12.5%). With the minimal human input of selecting from LLM-generated candidates, the performance is boosted to 37.5%. (And we argue this is a lower bound on the performance of our approach without filtering.) Our ablation studies show that abstract hypothesis generation and concrete program representations are both beneficial for LLMs to perform inductive reasoning tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ruocheng"},{"family":"Zelikman","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Poesia","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Pu","given":"Yewen"},{"family":"Haber","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Noah D."}],"citation-key":"wang_hypothesis_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2309.05660","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,11]]},"number":"arXiv:2309.05660","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Hypothesis Search: Inductive Reasoning with Language Models","title-short":"Hypothesis Search","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05660"},

  {"id":"wang_lung_2017","abstract":"Abstract Introduction The efficacy of osimertinib was compromised by the development of resistance mechanisms, such as EGFR C797S. In vitro study proved that cells harboring EGFR C797S in trans with T790M are sensitive to a combination of first- and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, this has not been reported clinically. Methods We performed capture-based sequencing on longitudinal plasma samples obtained at various treatment milestones from a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who was undergoing targeted therapy. Results At the development of resistance to osimertinib, the patient's plasma sample revealed EGFR C797S located in trans with T790M. He achieved partial response accompanied by undetectable C797S after commencement of a combinatorial treatment consisting of erlotinib and osimertinib. After 3 months of progression-free survival, he experienced progressive disease with emergence of EGFR C797S located in cis to T790M. Conclusion We report the first clinical evidence of efficacy generated by combination therapy consisting of first- and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting concomitant EGFR T790M and C797S in trans. We also reveal that the clonal progression of C797S from in trans to in cis at disease progression may serve as a potential resistance mechanism.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jin-Ji"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Junyi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xu-Chao"},{"family":"Tu","given":"Hai-Yan"},{"family":"Han-Zhang","given":"Han"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yi-Long"}],"citation-key":"wang_lung_2017","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"warraich_relapse_2019","abstract":"Abstract Relapse after stem cell transplantation for Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a significant challenge. In this systematic review, we compare survival outcomes of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) nilotinib and dasatinib with first-generation TKI imatinib when these agents are used after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in Ph+ ALL. In addition, we review the literature on TKI use to prevent relapse in patients who proceed to allo-HSCT beyond first complete response (>CR1). We performed database searches (inception to January 2018) using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. After exclusions, 17 articles were included in this analysis. Imatinib was used post-transplant either prophylactically or preemptively in 12 studies, 7 prospective studies and 5 retrospective studies. Overall survival (OS) for most prospective studies at 1.5 to 3 and 5 years ranged between 62% to 92% and 74.5% to 86.7%. Disease-free survival at 1.5 to 5 years was 60.4% to 92%. Additionally, imatinib failed to show survival benefit in patients who were >CR1 at the time of allo-HSCT. The cumulative OS for most retrospective studies using imatinib at 1 to 2 and 3 to 5 years was 42% to 100% and 33% to 40% respectively. Event-free survival at 1 to 2 and 3 to 5 years was 33.3% to 67% and 20% to 31% respectively. Dasatinib was used as maintenance treatment in 3 retrospective studies (nÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ34). The OS for patients with Ph+ ALL using dasatinib as maintenance regimen after allo-HSCT at 1.4 to 3 years was 87% to 100% and disease-free survival at 1.4 to 3 years was 89% to 100%. Ninety-three percent of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) positive status after allo-HSCT became MRD negative. Three prospective studies used nilotinib. In 2 studies where investigators studied patients with advanced chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL, the cumulative OS and event-free survival at 7.5 months to 2 years were 69% to 84% and 56% to 84%, respectively. In the third study (nÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ5) in patients with Ph+ ALL, nilotinib use resulted in OS at 5 years of 60%. Our review showed that use of TKIs (all generations) after allo-HSCT for patients in CR1 improved OS when given as a prophylactic or preemptive regimen. Limited data suggest that second-generation TKIs (ie, dasatinib) have a better OS, especially in patients with MRD-positive status. Imatinib did not improve OS in patients who were >CR1 at the time of allo-HSCT; for this population, no data were available with newer generation TKIs. The evaluation of survival benefit with newer generation TKIs and their efficacy in patients in >CR1 needs further study in large randomized clinical trials.","author":[{"family":"Warraich","given":"Zabih"},{"family":"Tenneti","given":"Pavan"},{"family":"Thai","given":"Theresa"},{"family":"Hubben","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Hina"},{"family":"McBride","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Warraich","given":"Sami Ullah"},{"family":"Hannan","given":"Abdul"},{"family":"Warraich","given":"Faiza Hassan"},{"family":"Majhail","given":"Navneet S."},{"family":"Kalaycio","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Anwer","given":"Faiz"}],"citation-key":"warraich_relapse_2019","container-title":"Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","container-title-short":"Biol. blood marrow transplant. : j.

  {"id":"watanabe_abstract_2019","abstract":"Background: Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring driver oncogene such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement are sensitive to the corresponding molecular targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, acquired resistance inevitably develops, and more effective treatment strategies are needed. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab significantly prolongs progression free survival when added to first-generation EGFR TKIs in EGFR mutant NSCLC. However, it remains unknown whether anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) antibody enhances the efficacy of molecular targeted agents as well. In this study, we investigated combinations with an anti-VEGFR antibody and EGFR or ALK TKIs in preclinical models Materials and Methods: We treated mice bearing subcutaneous tumor cell lines harboring EGFR mutation (PC-9, H3255) or ALK rearrangement (ABC-11, H3122) using combinations of anti-mouse VEGFR antibody DC101 and erlotinib (EGFR TKI) /alectinib (ALK TKI). Neovascularization of the tumors were determined by CD31 immunostaining. To determine the effects of VEGFR antibody on cancer cell itself, we also examined the efficacy of the combinations in vitro. Results: Combination therapy demonstrated significantly better tumor inhibition compared to erlotinib or alectinib alone in all the examined xenograft tumors. CD31 positive blood vessel staining was significantly reduced in the tumors treated with combination therapy. Mutant EGFR transfection in HEK293T cells increased VEGF expression in the cell culture supernatant. Furthermore, MTT assay showed significantly enhanced cell growth inhibition when anti-human VEGFR antibody ramucirumab combined with erlotinib (against PC-9 or H3255 cells) or alectinib (against ABC-11 or H3122 cells) suggesting that anti-VEGFR antibody affects not only on tumor vasculature but cancer cell itself. Consistent with this finding, combination with siVEGFR and erlotinib also inhibited the cell proliferation significantly better than erlotinib alone in PC-9 cells. Conclusion: A significant combination benefit was observed with anti-VEGFR2 antibody and EGFR or ALK TKI both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting anti-VEGFR antibody inhibits not only the blood vessels but may also exert direct anticancer effects. Combination therapy of erlotinib or alectinib and anti-VEGFR2 antibody could be a promising treatment strategy for oncogene addicted NSCLC.

  {"id":"wee_epidermal_2017","abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is commonly upregulated in cancers such as in non-small-cell lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Various mechanisms mediate the upregulation of EGFR activity, including common mutations and truncations to its extracellular domain, such as in the EGFRvIII truncations, as well as to its kinase domain, such as the L858R and T790M mutations, or the exon 19 truncation. These EGFR aberrations over-activate downstream pro-oncogenic signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK and AKT-PI3K-mTOR pathways. These pathways then activate many biological outputs that are beneficial to cancer cell proliferation, including their chronic initiation and progression through the cell cycle. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms that regulate EGFR signal transduction, including the EGFR structure and its mutations, ligand binding and EGFR dimerization, as well as the signaling pathways that lead to G1 cell cycle progression. We focus on the induction of CYCLIN D expression, CDK4/6 activation, and the repression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins (CDKi) by EGFR signaling pathways. We also discuss the successes and challenges of EGFR-targeted therapies, and the potential for their use in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors.","author":[{"family":"Wee","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhixiang"}],"call-number":"2","citation-key":"wee_epidermal_2017","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers9050052","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"52-NA","source":"5.2","title":"Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Cell Proliferation Signaling Pathways.","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the association between comorbid cancer and the odds of receiving thrombolysis after adjustment for patient- and hospital-level covariates. In those receiving thrombolysis, the association between cancer and in-hospital mortality was determined using logistic regression after adjusting for age‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ65 years and sex. We identified 72,546 admissions for acute PE; of which, 14.7% (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ10,673) had comorbid cancer. A total of 3.4% (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ2439) of patients received thrombolysis. Upon multivariable adjustment, cancer was associated with decreased odds of receiving thrombolysis (odds ratio‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.55; 95% confidence interval‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.48‚Äì0.64). When the population was restricted to PE admissions receiving thrombolysis, mortality occurred in 315 (12.9%) admissions; with no difference in in-hospital mortality observed between those with versus without cancer (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.11). In this study of admissions for acute PE, comorbid cancer was associated with decreased odds of receiving thrombolysis. As PE is a common complication among patients with cancer, the risk‚Äìbenefit profile of thrombolysis in this patient population should be determined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Weeda","given":"Erin R."},{"family":"Hakamiun","given":"Kevin M."},{"family":"Leschorn","given":"Hannah X."},{"family":"Tran","given":"Emmeline"}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"weeda_comorbid_2019","container-title":"Journal of Thrombosis and Thrombolysis","container-title-short":"J Thromb Thrombolysis","DOI":"10.1007/s11239-018-1772-5","ISSN":"0929-5305, 1573-742X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2]]},"language":"en","page":"324-327","source":"5.221","title":"Comorbid cancer and use of thrombolysis in acute pulmonary embolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11239-018-1772-5","volume":"47"},
  {"id":"weeks_causes_2023","abstract":"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is described as the outsized contribution of expanded clones of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to blood cell production. The prevalence of CH increases dramatically with age. CH can be caused by somatic mutations in individual genes or by gains and/or losses of larger chromosomal segments. CH is a premalignant state; the somatic mutations detected in CH are the initiating mutations for hematologic malignancies, and CH is a strong predictor of the development of blood cancers. Moreover, CH is associated with nonmalignant disorders and increased overall mortality. The somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion of HSPCs can alter the function of terminally differentiated blood cells, including the release of elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines may then contribute to a broad range of inflammatory disorders that increase in prevalence with age. Specific somatic mutations in the peripheral blood in coordination with blood count parameters can powerfully predict the development of hematologic malignancies and overall mortality in CH. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of CH nosology and origins. We provide an overview of available tools¬†for risk stratification and discuss management strategies for patients with CH presenting to hematology clinics.","author":[{"family":"Weeks","given":"Lachelle D"},{"family":"Ebert","given":"Benjamin L"}],"citation-key":"weeks_causes_2023","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2023022222","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en-US","page":"2235-2246","title":"Causes and consequences of clonal hematopoiesis.","type":"article-journal","volume":"142"},

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xuezhi"},{"family":"Schuurmans","given":"Dale"},{"family":"Bosma","given":"Maarten"},{"family":"Ichter","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Chi","given":"Ed"},{"family":"Le","given":"Quoc"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Denny"}],"citation-key":"wei_chainofthought_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2201.11903","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,10]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2201.11903","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903"},

  {"id":"weickhardt_local_2012","abstract":"Introduction: Many patients with oncogene-driven nonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors experience limited sites of disease progression. This study investigated retrospectively the benefits of local ablative therapy (LAT) to central nervous system (CNS) and/or limited systemic disease progression and continuation of crizotinib or erlotinib in patients with metastatic ALK gene rearrangement ( ALK+ ) or EGFR -mutant ( EGFR -MT) NSCLC, respectively. Methods: Patients with metastatic ALK + NSCLC treated with crizotinib ( n = 38) and EGFR -MT NSCLC treated with erlotinib ( n = 27) were identified at a single institution. Initial response to the respective kinase inhibitors, median progression-free survival (PFS1), and site of first progression were recorded. A subset of patients with either nonleptomeningeal CNS and/or four sites or fewer of extra-CNS progression (oligoprogressive disease) suitable for LAT received either radiation or surgery to these sites and continued on the same tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The subsequent median progression-free survival from the time of first progression (PFS2) and pattern of progression were recorded. Results: Median progression-free survival in ALK + patients on crizotinib was 9.0 months, and 13.8 months for EGFR -MT patients on erlotinib. Twenty-five of 51 patients (49%) who progressed were deemed suitable for local therapy (15 ALK +, 10 EGFR -MT; 24 with radiotherapy, one with surgery) and continuation of the same targeted therapy. Post-LAT, 19 of 25 patients progressed again, with median PFS2 of 6.2 months. Discussion: Oncogene-addicted NSCLC with CNS and/or limited systemic disease progression (oligoprogressive disease) on relevant targeted therapies is often suitable for LAT and continuation of the targeted agent, and is associated with more than 6 months of additional disease control.","author":[{"family":"Weickhardt","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Scheier","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Burke","given":"Joseph Malachy"},{"family":"Gan","given":"Gregory N."},{"family":"Lu","given":"Xian"},{"family":"Bunn","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Aisner","given":"Dara L."},{"family":"Gaspar","given":"Laurie E."},{"family":"Kavanagh","given":"Brian D."},{"family":"Doebele","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Camidge","given":"D.

  {"id":"weihua_intergenic_2020","abstract":"Abstract Introduction Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on genomic DNA has been widely applied for gene rearrangement detection in patients with NSCLC. However, intergenic-breakpoint fusions, in which one or both genomic breakpoints localize to intergenic regions, confound kinase fusion detection. We evaluated the function of intergenic-breakpoint fusions with multiplex molecular testing approaches. Methods NSCLCs with intergenic-breakpoint fusion identified by DNA-based NGS were analyzed by RNA-based NGS, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Results A total of 26 cases with single intergenic-breakpoint fusion were identified from a large cohort of NSCLCs using DNA-based NGS. Of the 26 cases, RNA-based NGS detected expressed fusion transcripts in 11 cases, but the genomic breakpoint position did not logically predict breakpoint of the fusion transcript in these cases, possibly owing to complex rearrangements (n = 5), alternative splicing (n = 2), and reciprocal rearrangement (n = 4). Nonetheless, no expressed fusion transcript was detected in five cases. Moreover, positive anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine (ALK) finding was observed in three of the remaining 10 cases with IHC but not with RNA-based NGS. Three patients with intergenic-breakpoint ALK fusion with or without RNA-based NGS or IHC confirmation who received crizotinib treatment were found to have partial responses. However, one patient with intergenic-breakpoint ROS1, given the positive fluorescence in situ hybridization result, received crizotinib but developed progressive disease within 1 month, possibly owing to no functional fusion transcript detected by RNA-based NGS. Conclusions Intergenic-breakpoint fusions detected by DNA sequencing confound kinase fusion detection in NSCLC, as functional fusion transcripts may be generated or not. Additional validation testing using RNA/protein assay should be performed in intergenic-breakpoint fusion cases to guide optimal treatment.","author":[{"family":"Weihua","given":""},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yutao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenbin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Li"},{"family":"Ying","given":"Jianming Li"}],"citation-key":"weihua_intergenic_2020","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

Here, we report outcomes of a preplanned subgroup analysis of patients ‚â•65 years in ZUMA-7.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with LBCL refractory to or relapsed ‚â§12 months after first-line chemoimmunotherapy were randomized 1:1 to axicabtagene ciloleucel [axi-cel; autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy] or standard of care (SOC; 2-3 cycles of chemoimmunotherapy followed by HDT-ASCT). The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). Secondary endpoints included safety and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).\nRESULTS: Fifty-one and 58 patients aged ‚â•65 years were randomized to axi-cel and SOC, respectively. Median EFS was greater with axi-cel versus SOC (21.5 vs. 2.5 months; median follow-up: 24.3 months; HR, 0.276; descriptive P < 0.0001). Objective response rate was higher with axi-cel versus SOC (88% vs. 52%; OR, 8.81; descriptive P < 0.0001; complete response rate: 75% vs. 33%).

Chemotherapy was delayed or dose reduced due to toxicity in 8 patients (18%); osimertinib was discontinued in 1 patient (2%) for reduced cardiac ejection fraction, and dose reduced in 2 patients (5%). Conclusions The combination of osimertinib plus chemotherapy appeared safe and showed favorable control of CNS disease in this cohort of patients who had progressed systemically with multiple prior lines of therapy, with DOT and survival outcomes similar to historical chemotherapy controls.","author":[{"family":"White","given":"Maya N."},{"family":"Piotrowska","given":"Zofia"},{"family":"Stirling","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Stephen V."},{"family":"Banwait","given":"Mandeep"},{"family":"Cunanan","given":"Kristen M."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Wakelee","given":"Heather A."},{"family":"Hausrath","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Neal","given":"Joel W."}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"white_combining_2021","container-title":"Clinical lung cancer","container-title-short":"Clin.

  {"id":"wieduwilt_dasatinib_2021","abstract":"Post-remission strategies after dasatinib-corticosteroid induction in adults with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are not well studied. We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of dasatinib and dexamethasone induction then protocol-defined post-remission therapies, including hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Adults (N=65) with Ph-positive ALL received dasatinib and dexamethasone induction, methotrexate-based central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy alone based on age and donor availability, and dasatinib-based maintenance. Key efficacy endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The median age was 60 years (range, 22-87). The complete remission rate was 98.5%. With a median follow up of 59 months, 5-year DFS and OS were 37% (median, 30 months) and 48% (median, 56 months), respectively. For patients receiving RIC allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy, 5-year DFSs were 49%, 29%, and 34% and 5-year OSs were 62%, 57%, and 46%, respectively. Complete molecular response rate after CNS prophylaxis was 40%. Relative to the p190 isoform, p210 had shorter DFS (median 10 vs 34 months, P=0.002) and OS (median 16 months vs not reached, P=0.05). Relapse occurred in 25% of allogeneic HCT, 57% of autologous HCT, and 36% of chemotherapy patients. T315I mutation was detected in 6 of 8 marrow relapses. Dasatinib CNS concentrations were low. Dasatinib and dexamethasone followed by RIC allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy was feasible and efficacious, especially with RIC allogeneic HCT. Future studies should address the major causes of treatment failure: T315I mutation, the p210 BCR-ABL1 isoform, and CNS relapse.","author":[{"family":"Wieduwilt","given":"Matthew J"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Wetzler","given":"Meir"},{"family":"Uy","given":"Geoffrey L."},{"family":"Powell","given":"Bayard L."},{"family":"Kolitz","given":"Jonathan E."},{"family":"Liedtke","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Stock","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Beumer","given":"Jan H."},{"family":"Mattison","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Storrick","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Christner","given":"Susan M."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Lionel D."},{"family":"Devine","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Stone","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Larson","given":"Richard A."}],"citation-key":"wieduwilt_dasatinib_2021","container-title":"Blood Advances","container-title-short":"Blood Adv.","DOI":"10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004813","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"4691-4700","title":"Dasatinib and dexamethasone followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation for adults with ph-positive ALL.","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

P2Y receptors mediated resistance in part through a protein-kinase-C (PKC)-dependent mechanism. Moreover, PKC activation alone was sufficient to confer resistance to ALK inhibitors, whereas combined ALK and PKC inhibition restored sensitivity. We observed enrichment of gene signatures associated with several resistance drivers (including P2Y receptors) in crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged lung tumors compared to treatment-naive controls, supporting a role for these identified mechanisms in clinical ALK inhibitor resistance.","author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Frederick H."},{"family":"Johannessen","given":"Cory M."},{"family":"Piccioni","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Tamayo","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jong Wook"},{"family":"Van","given":"Allen Eliezer M."},{"family":"Corsello","given":"Steven M."},{"family":"Capelletti","given":"Marzia"},{"family":"Calles","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Butaney","given":"Mohit"},{"family":"Sharifnia","given":"Tanaz"},{"family":"Gabriel","given":"Stacey"},{"family":"Mesirov","given":"Jill P."},{"family":"Hahn","given":"William C."},{"family":"Engelman","given":"Jeffrey A."},{"family":"Meyerson","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Root","given":"David E."},{"family":"JÁì£nne","given":"Pasi A."},{"family":"Garraway","given":"Levi A."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"wilson_functional_2015","container-title":"Cancer cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.ccell.2015.02.005","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"397-408","source":"50.3","title":"A functional landscape of resistance to ALK inhibition in lung cancer.","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

The successful implementation of involved node radiation therapy requires optimal imaging and precise coregistration of baseline imaging with the radiation therapy planning computed tomography scan. Limitations of baseline imaging, changes in patient position, and anatomic changes after chemotherapy may make this difficult in routine practice. Involved site radiation therapy (ISRT) was introduced by the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group as a slightly larger treated volume, intended to allow for commonly encountered uncertainties. In addition to imaging considerations, the optimal ISRT treatment volume also depends on disease histology, stage, nodal or extranodal location, and the type and efficacy of systemic therapy, which in turn influence the distribution of macroscopic and potential subclinical disease. This article presents a systematic overview of ISRT, updating key evidence and highlighting differences in the application of ISRT across the lymphoma clinical spectrum.","author":[{"family":"Wirth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Mikhaeel","given":"N.

We report final efficacy and safety data, and exploratory molecular profiling.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who received prior platinum-doublet chemotherapy and crizotinib were randomized 2¬†:¬†1 to receive alectinib 600 mg twice daily (n¬†= 79) or chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 or docetaxel 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks; n¬†= 40) until progressive disease, death or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints included ORR, CNS ORR and safety. Plasma samples were collected at baseline, then every 6 weeks until progressive disease; molecular factors detected by next-generation sequencing were correlated with outcomes.\nRESULTS: Investigator-assessed PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than chemotherapy (median 10.9 versus 1.4 months; hazard ratio 0.20, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.33; P < 0.001). ORR was 50.6% with alectinib versus 2.5% with chemotherapy (P < 0.001). In patients with measurable CNS metastases at baseline, CNS ORR was 66.7% with alectinib versus 0% with chemotherapy (P < 0.001). No new safety signals were seen. ALK rearrangement was identified in 69.5% (n¬†= 41/59) of baseline plasma samples. Confirmed partial responses were observed with alectinib in 6/11 patients with a secondary ALK mutation and 4/6 patients with a non-EML4-ALK (where EML4 is echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) fusion. Detection of mutant TP53 in baseline plasma resulted in numerically shorter PFS with alectinib (hazard ratio 1.88, 95% confidence interval 0.9-3.93).\nCONCLUSIONS: Final efficacy data from ALUR confirmed the superior PFS, ORR and CNS ORR of alectinib versus chemotherapy in pretreated, advanced ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Alectinib prolonged PFS versus chemotherapy in patients with wild-type or mutant TP53; however, alectinib activity was considerably decreased in patients with mutant TP53.","author":[{"family":"Wolf","given":"J."},{"family":"Helland","given":"√Ö"},{"family":"Oh","given":"I.-J."},{"family":"Migliorino","given":"M.

  {"id":"woll_targeting_2022","abstract":"The genetic architecture of cancer has been delineated through advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing, where the sequential acquisition of recurrent driver mutations initially targeted towards normal cells ultimately leads to malignant transformation. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are hematologic malignancies frequently initiated by mutations in the normal hematopoietic stem cell compartment leading to the establishment of leukemic stem cells. Although the genetic characterization of MDS and AML has led to identification of new therapeutic targets and development of new promising therapeutic strategies, disease progression, relapse, and treatment-related mortality remain a major challenge in MDS and AML. The selective persistence of rare leukemic stem cells following therapy-induced remission implies unique resistance mechanisms of leukemic stem cells towards conventional therapeutic strategies and that leukemic stem cells represent the cellular origin of relapse. Therefore, targeted surveillance of leukemic stem cells following therapy should, in the future, allow better prediction of relapse and disease progression, but is currently challenged by our restricted ability to distinguish leukemic stem cells from other leukemic cells and residual normal cells. To advance current and new clinical strategies for the treatment of MDS and AML, there is a need to improve our understanding and characterization of MDS and AML stem cells at the cellular, molecular, and genetic levels. Such work has already led to the identification of promising new candidate leukemic stem cell molecular targets that can now be exploited in preclinical and clinical therapeutic strategies, towards more efficient and specific elimination of leukemic stem cells.","author":[{"family":"Woll","given":"Petter S"},{"family":"Yoshizato","given":"Tetsuichi"},{"family":"Hellstr√∂m-Lindberg","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Fioretos","given":"Thoas"},{"family":"Ebert","given":"Benjamin L"},{"family":"Jacobsen","given":"Sten Eirik W"}],"citation-key":"woll_targeting_2022","container-title":"Journal of internal medicine","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"woodruff_lowmolecularweightheparin_2019","abstract":"In patients with active cancer and acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), the low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) dalteparin is more effective than vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (rVTE) without increasing the risk of bleeding. However, the relative benefit of LMWH versus VKA in patients with active cancer at high or low risk of rVTE and bleeding is unclear. This post hoc analysis used data from the CLOT study to explore the efficacy and safety of LMWH versus VKA in preventing recurrent thrombosis in high- and low-risk patients with active cancer. High-risk patients were defined by metastatic disease and/or antineoplastic treatment at baseline; low-risk patients presented with neither. Among high-risk patients, rVTE occurred in 25/318 (8%) (LMWH) versus 53/314 (17%) (VKA) (hazard ratio, 0.44; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001). No significant difference was detected in the rate of major or any bleeding. The 6-month mortality rate was 40% (LMWH) versus 41% (VKA). In low-risk patients, 2/20 (10%) (LMWH) had rVTE versus 0/24 (0%) (VKA) (hazard ratio, not estimable; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.998). No significant difference was detected in the rate of major or any bleeding. The 6-month mortality rate was 20% (LMWH) versus 29% (VKA). In patients with cancer-associated thrombosis at high risk of rVTE and bleeding, the LMWH dalteparin was more effective than VKA in reducing the risk of rVTE without increasing the risk of bleeding. No difference in rate of rVTE or bleeding was observed between LMWH and VKA among low-risk patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Woodruff","given":"Seth"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Agnes Y.

  {"id":"wright_thirdgeneration_2019","abstract":"Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are the most common targetable genomic drivers of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), occurring in approximately 50% and 10-15% of adenocarcinomas of the lung in Asian and Western populations, respectively. The most common EGFR-activating mutations, the exon 19 deletion and the L858R point mutation occurring in the receptor tyrosine kinase domain, are susceptible to inhibition. The first EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to be evaluated were the reversible first-generation EGFR TKIs, gefitinib and erlotinib, followed by the irreversible second-generation EGFR TKIs, afatinib and dacomitinib. The study of acquired resistance mechanisms to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs in patients with activating EGFR-mutated NSCLC identified the gatekeeper T790M point mutation, present in over 50% of cases, as the most common mechanism of acquired resistance. The need to overcome this resistance mechanism led to the development of third-generation EGFR TKIs, of which osimertinib is the only one to date with regulatory approval. In this review, we present the clinical context leading to the development of third-generation EGFR TKIs, the mode of action of these inhibitors and the clinical data supporting their use. We review third-generation TKI agents that are approved, in development, and those that failed in clinical trials. Finally, we will touch upon ongoing studies and future directions, such as combination treatment strategies, currently being explored to improve the efficacy of treatment with third-generation EGFR TKIs.","author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Natalie Andrews"},{"family":"Goss","given":"Glenwood D."}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"wright_thirdgeneration_2019","container-title":"Translational lung cancer research","container-title-short":"Transl.

  {"id":"wu_large_2023","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in multiple software engineering tasks including code generation, code summarisation, test generation and code repair. Fault localisation is essential for facilitating automatic program debugging and repair, and is demonstrated as a highlight at ChatGPT-4's launch event. Nevertheless, there has been little work understanding LLMs' capabilities for fault localisation in large-scale open-source programs. To fill this gap, this paper presents an in-depth investigation into the capability of ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, the two state-of-the-art LLMs, on fault localisation. Using the widely-adopted Defects4J dataset, we compare the two LLMs with the existing fault localisation techniques. We also investigate the stability and explanation of LLMs in fault localisation, as well as how prompt engineering and the length of code context affect the fault localisation effectiveness. Our findings demonstrate that within a limited code context, ChatGPT-4 outperforms all the existing fault localisation methods. Additional error logs can further improve ChatGPT models' localisation accuracy and stability, with an average 46.9% higher accuracy over the state-of-the-art baseline SmartFL in terms of TOP-1 metric. However, performance declines dramatically when the code context expands to the class-level, with ChatGPT models' effectiveness becoming inferior to the existing methods overall. Additionally, we observe that ChatGPT's explainability is unsatisfactory, with an accuracy rate of only approximately 30%. These observations demonstrate that while ChatGPT can achieve effective fault localisation performance under certain conditions, evident limitations exist. Further research is imperative to fully harness the potential of LLMs like ChatGPT for practical fault localisation applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Yonghao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jie M."},{"family":"Papadakis","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Harman","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yong"}],"citation-key":"wu_large_2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2308.15276","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,2]]},"number":"arXiv:2308.15276","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Large Language Models in Fault Localisation","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15276"},

  {"id":"wu_progesterone_2017","abstract":"High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) originates mainly from the fallopian tube (FT) epithelium and always carries early TP53 mutations. We previously reported that tumors initiate in the FT fimbria epithelium because of apoptotic failure and the expansion of cells with DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) caused by bathing of the FT epithelial cells in reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and hemoglobin-rich follicular fluid (FF) after ovulation. Because ovulation is frequent and HGSOC is rare, we hypothesized that luteal-phase progesterone (P4) could eliminate p53-defective FT cells. Here we show that P4, via P4 receptors (PRs), induces necroptosis in Trp53‚àí/‚àí mouse oviduct epithelium and in immortalized human p53-defective fimbrial epithelium through the TNF-Œ±/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway. Necroptosis occurs specifically at diestrus, recovers at the proestrus phase of the estrus cycle, and can be augmented with P4 supplementation. These results reveal the mechanism of the well-known ability of progesterone to prevent ovarian cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Na-Yiyuan"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Hsuan-Shun"},{"family":"Chao","given":"Tung Hui"},{"family":"Chou","given":"Hsien Ming"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Chong-Zhen"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Chueh-Yu"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Tang-Yuan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Hong Hao"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"wu_progesterone_2017","container-title":"Cell Reports","container-title-short":"Cell Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.celrep.2017.02.049","ISSN":"2211-1247","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,14]]},"language":"en","page":"2557-2565","PMID":"28297660","source":"9.995","title":"Progesterone Prevents High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer by Inducing Necroptosis of p53-Defective Fallopian Tube Epithelial Cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124717302474","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"xu_characterization_2019","abstract":"Purpose: Responses to EGFR-targeted therapy are generally temporary, due to inevitable drug resistance. The prevalence and characteristics of receptor tyrosine-kinase (RTK) fusion as acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are rarely investigated. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed genomic profiling data of 3873 EGFR (exons 18-21)-mutant lung cancer patients with more than once next-generation sequencing detection. A total of 16 patients who acquired RTK fusions during EGFR-TKI treatment with paired pre- and post-EGFR-TKI samples were identified. Their treatment history was collected. Results: Newly acquired RTK fusions during EGFR-TKI treatment included RET (n=6, 37.5%), ALK (n=5, 31.3%), NTRK1 (n=4, 25.0%), ROS1 (n=1, 6.3%), and FGFR3 (n=1, 6.3%). All RET and EML4-ALK fusions were uncommon variants of KIF5B-RET and E2:A20 (V5), respectively. Interestingly, RET fusion occurred only after osimertinib treatment, and contributed to drug resistance in 50% (6 of 12) of patients treated with osimertinib, indicating that fusions had different prevalence when functioning as resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs. Moreover, we found that in all patients developing drug resistance to EGFR TKIs due to fusion emergence (n=16), those that had a treatment history of third-generation EGFR TKIs accounted for 75% (n=12). Conclusion: We have extended the current knowledge of resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs in non-small-cell lung cancer. Detection of RTK fusions should be included in genomic profiling panels to uncover potential resistance mechanisms of EGFR TKIs, which might inform therapeutic strategies, such as combination-therapy approaches, to circumvent tumorigenesis.","author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Haiyuan"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Jinge"},{"family":"Xiang","given":"Jianxing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Haiyan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tengfei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Xinru"},{"family":"Jian","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Shu","given":"Yongqian"}],"call-number":"4","citation-key":"xu_characterization_2019","container-title":"Cancer management and research","container-title-short":"Cancer Manag.

  {"id":"yan_phase_2023","abstract":"IntroductionStudies showed that remission after induction therapy is associated with better prognosis in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients, and minimal residual disease (MRD) is also considered as an independent and sensitive factor in MCL patients. As R-CHOP/R-DHAOx is the most common used induction regimen in China, we investigate the benefit of zanubrutinib-based induction (zanubrutinib plus R-CHOP) in untreated young MCL patients. We previously reported a promising result of an ORR of 100% with MRD negative rate of 100% after induction treatment in 2022 PPLC. Here, we reported a long-time (median follow-up: 25.9 months) efficacy and safety in the study.MethodsIn this prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase II study (NCT04736914), patients aged 18-65 years with previously untreated, Ann Arbor stage II-IV, histologically confirmed MCL will be enrolled to alternately receive R-CHOP + zanubrutinib and R-DHAOx induction for 6 cycles (every 21 days per cycle). Zanubrutinib will be administered in cycle 1, 3, 5 (R-CHOP), 160 mg BID, d1-21, and not in combination with R-DHAOx. Patients who achieve remission (‚â•PR) will be allowed to proceed to ASCT or maintenance depending on the investigator's evaluation and discretion. In patients who do not achieve a remission at the end of induction (treatment failure), no specific treatment is defined; rather, the further salvage treatment is upon the discretion of investigators. Patients will receive zanubrutinib maintenance for two years in case of remission at ASCT assessment or end of induction assessment. Zanubrutinib is administrated orally at 160 mg BID, continuously for 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death, whichever occurs first. The primary endpoint was bone marrow MRD negative rate after induction therapy (at the completion of cycle 6 or at premature discontinuation).ResultsA total of 7 patients were enrolled, the median age was 56.3, and bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB) MRD showed positive at baseline. After 6 cycles of R-CHOP + zanubrutinib and R-DHAOx induction treatment, BM and PB MRD negative rate was 100% (7/7). One patient proceeded to ASCT. At the data cut-off date of 30 Jun 2023, one patient has completed the study at week 53 with zanubrutinib maintenance treatment due to the progressive disease, while the other 6 patients remain in the zanubrutinib maintenance treatment and are still under follow-up (Figure). With a median follow-up of 25.9 months, all patients showed good tolerance, with no dose modification and discontinuation during zanubrutinib-based induction therapy, either no BTKi interested AE (includes diarrhea, hypertension, major hemorrhage, and atrial fibrillation/flutter) was observed (Table).ConclusionsThis prospective, phase II study with a relatively longer follow-up duration estimated the treatment regimen in untreated young MCL patients. At the time of data cut-off, zanubrutinib-based induction therapy was well tolerated in all patients and showed a promising results in response and MRD. With a median treatment duration of 16.6 months, most patients (6/7) did not relapse. The study is ongoing and further results will be continuously released.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Gao"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Qingqing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhiming"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaoxiao"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xuanye"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He"},{"family":"Bai","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Huiqiang"}],"citation-key":"yan_phase_2023","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-181619","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"Supplement 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"language":"en","page":"6147","source":"Silverchair","title":"A phase II study of zanubrutinib-based induction and maintenance therapy in young and fit patients with untreated mantle cell lymphoma (BRIDGE): an updated analysis with long-term follow up","title-short":"A Phase II Study of Zanubrutinib-Based Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Young and Fit Patients with Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma (BRIDGE)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2023-181619","volume":"142"},

The primary end point was blinded independent review committee‚Äìassessed progression-free survival (PFS). Interim analysis for efÔ¨Åcacy and futility was planned at approximately 70% of 164 expected PFS events.\nResults: The population (N ¬º 248; brigatinib, n ¬º 125; alectinib, n ¬º 123) was notable for long median duration of prior crizotinib (16.0‚Äì16.8 mo) and low rate of ALK fusion in baseline circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA; 78 of 232 [34%]).

  {"id":"yang_investigating_2018","abstract":"Purpose: The third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib is approved to treat patients with EGFR T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have developed resistance to earlier-generation drugs. Acquired EGFR C797S mutation has been reported to mediate osimertinib resistance in some patients. However, the remaining resistance mechanisms are largely unknown.Experimental Design: We performed mutation profiling using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) for 416 cancer-relevant genes on 93 osimertinib-resistant lung cancer patients' samples, mainly cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs), and matched pretreatment samples of 12 patients. In vitro experiments were conducted to functionally study the secondary EGFR mutations identified.Results:EGFR G796/C797, L792, and L718/G719 mutations were identified in 24.7%, 10.8%, and 9.7% of the cases, respectively, with certain mutations coexisting in one patient with different prevalence. L792 and L718 mutants markedly increased the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of osimertinib in vitro, among which the L718Q mutation conferred the greatest resistance to osimertinib, as well as gefitinib resistance when not coexisting with T790M. Further analysis of the 12 matched pretreatment samples confirmed that these EGFR mutations were acquired during osimertinib treatment. Alterations in parallel or downstream oncogenes such as MET, KRAS, and PIK3CA were also discovered, potentially contributing to the osimertinib-resistance in patients without EGFR secondary mutations.Conclusions: We present comprehensive mutation profiles of a large cohort of osimertinib-resistance lung cancer patients using mainly cfDNA. Besides C797 mutations, novel secondary mutations of EGFR L718 and L792 residues confer osimertinib resistance, both in vitro and in vivo, and are of great clinical and pharmaceutical relevance.

  {"id":"yang_pembrolizumab_2018","abstract":"Abstract Introduction Anti-EGFR agents are standard treatments for patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC. The feasibility of combining erlotinib or gefitinib with the antiÔøΩ¢ñØrogrammed death 1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab was evaluated in the phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-021 study (NCT02039674). Methods Adults with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks plus oral erlotinib 150 mg daily in cohort E or oral gefitinib 250 mg daily in cohort F, using a 3 + 3 design with cohort expansion. rTumor response was evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by blinded independent central review. The primary objective was determination of a recommended phase 2 dose. Results Twelve patients enrolled to receive pembrolizumab plus erlotinib and seven to receive pembrolizumab plus gefitinib. No dose-limiting toxicities or grade 5 events occurred. Pembrolizumab plus erlotinib was feasible, with adverse events similar to those expected for monotherapy. However, pembrolizumab plus gefitinib was not feasible due to grade 3/4 liver toxicity in five of seven patients (71.4%), leading to permanent treatment discontinuation in four patients. The most frequently occurring treatment-related adverse events with pembrolizumab plus erlotinib were rash (50.0%), dermatitis acneiform, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, and pruritus (33.3% each). The objective response rate was 41.7%, including response in all four patients with programmed death ligand 1 expression 50% or greater. Conclusions Although pembrolizumab plus gefitinib was not feasible, the toxicity profile observed with pembrolizumab plus erlotinib suggests combining immunotherapy with anti-EGFR therapy is feasible. Pembrolizumab plus erlotinib did not improve objective response rate compared with previous monotherapy studies; further evaluation would be necessary to evaluate potential effects on other efficacy outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"James Chih-Hsin"},{"family":"Gadgeel","given":"Shirish M."},{"family":"Sequist","given":"Lecia V."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Chien Liang"},{"family":"Papadimitrakopoulou","given":"Vassiliki A."},{"family":"Su","given":"Wu Chou"},{"family":"Fiore","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Saraf","given":"Sanatan"},{"family":"Raftopoulos","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Patnaik","given":"Amita"}],"citation-key":"yang_pembrolizumab_2018","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors have established therapeutic activity in B-cell malignancies, with modest activity in DLBCL. Zanubrutinib, a potent and selective BTK inhibitor, was evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) non-GCB DLBCL. The BGB-3111-207 study (NCT03145064) was a multicenter single-arm phase 2 study. Patients received twice-daily oral zanubrutinib, 160 mg, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR). Overall survival (OS) was an exploratory end point. Forty-one patients were enrolled in China after having progressed or not responded to prior therapy. At data cutoff, 4¬†patients continued treatment with 37 discontinuations. The median follow-up was 6.8 months, the ORR was 29.3%, and the complete response rate was 17.1%. Median DOR, PFS, and OS were 4.5, 2.8, and 8.4 months, respectively. Adverse events (AEs) leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 4 patients, and grade ‚â• 3 AEs were reported in 48.8% of patients. Major hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, and/or flutter were not observed. Zanubrutinib demonstrated modest antitumor activity in non-GCB DLBCL, like other BTK inhibitors, as well as a safety profile consistent with previous studies. Through retrospective biomarker testing, potential antitumor activity was observed in patients with both CD79B and MYD88 mutations, who have inferior outcomes to immunochemotherapy. Future studies of zanubrutinib in R/R non-GCB DLBCL will focus on developing mechanism-based treatment combinations and biomarker-driven patient selection.","author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Haiyan"},{"family":"Xiang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Song","given":"Yuqin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Huilai"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Weili"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Dehui"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Fangfang"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Aichun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Caixia"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Ziwen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Lina"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Haiyi"},{"family":"Novotny","given":"William"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yufu"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"yang_zanubrutinib_2022","container-title":"Blood Advances","container-title-short":"Blood Adv","DOI":"10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003698","ISSN":"2473-9537","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,22]]},"language":"eng","page":"1629-1636","PMCID":"PMC8941452","PMID":"34638136","source":"7.637","title":"Zanubrutinib monotherapy for relapsed or refractory non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"yoda_sequential_2018","abstract":"The cornerstone of treatment for advanced ALK-positive lung cancer is sequential therapy with increasingly potent and selective ALK inhibitors. The third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib has demonstrated clinical activity in patients who failed previous ALK inhibitors. To define the spectrum of ALK mutations that confer lorlatinib resistance, we performed accelerated mutagenesis screening of Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK. Under comparable conditions, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis generated numerous crizotinib-resistant but no lorlatinib-resistant clones harboring single ALK mutations. In similar screens with EML4-ALK containing single ALK resistance mutations, numerous lorlatinib-resistant clones emerged harboring compound ALK mutations. To determine the clinical relevance of these mutations, we analyzed repeat biopsies from lorlatinib-resistant patients. Seven of 20 samples (35%) harbored compound ALK mutations, including two identified in the ENU screen. Whole-exome sequencing in three cases confirmed the stepwise accumulation of ALK mutations during sequential treatment. These results suggest that sequential ALK inhibitors can foster the emergence of compound ALK mutations, identification of which is critical to informing drug design and developing effective therapeutic strategies.Significance: Treatment with sequential first-, second-, and third-generation ALK inhibitors can select for compound ALK mutations that confer high-level resistance to ALK-targeted therapies. A more efficacious long-term strategy may be up-front treatment with a third-generation ALK inhibitor to prevent the emergence of on-target resistance. Cancer Discov; 8(6); 714-29.

Asian patients are known to have a lower incidence of VTE compared to Caucasian patients. However, few studies have investigated the incidence of VTE in Asian patients with pancreatic cancer.\nMethods This retrospective review of medical records was performed on 505 patients with histopathologically proven advanced stage pancreatic cancer, from January 2006 to December 2012, at Soonchunhyang University Hospitals. *This study was supported by a grant from the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.

Patients with more advanced stages of pancreatic cancer (distant metastatic stage, recurrence) or who had received chemotherapy had a higher incidence of classic VTE. Patients who were simultaneously diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and classic VTE had a poorer prognosis than patients with subsequent VTEs. There was a significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the presence and absence of a concurrent classic VTE diagnosis (median: OS, 2.1 mo vs. 10.7 mo; PÔºú0.001). Even when VTE included SVT, the result was similar (PÔºú0.001).\nConclusion In Korean patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the incidence of VTEs is comparable to that of Caucasian patients. We also found that pancreatic cancer patients with concurrent VTEs had a poor prognosis compared to patients who developed VTEs later.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Yoon","given":"Seug Yun"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Min-Young"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Jina"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Han Jo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Kyoung-Ha"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Se Hyung"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sang-Cheol"},{"family":"Bae","given":"Sang Byung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Chan-Kyu"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Nam-Su"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kyu Taek"},{"family":"Park","given":"Sung Kyu"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Dae Sik"},{"family":"Won","given":"Jong-Ho"}],"citation-key":"yoon_incidence_2018","container-title":"Blood Research","container-title-short":"Blood Res","DOI":"10.5045/br.2018.53.3.227","ISSN":"2287-979X, 2288-0011","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"227","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The incidence of venous thromboembolism is not lowin Korean patients with advanced pancreatic cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5045/br.2018.53.3.227","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"yoshida_prospective_2007","abstract":"Introduction: We evaluated the efficacy of gefitinib monotherapy prospectively in patients with advanced or pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Methods: Patients with NSCLC were examined for EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations by fragment analysis and for EGFR L858R point mutations by the Cycleave polymerase chain reaction technique. EGFR mutation-positive patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent/refractory NSCLC that was not curable with surgery or thoracic radiotherapy were candidates for gefitinib treatment administered at 250 mg/day until disease progression. Results: Mutations of the EGFR gene were detected in 27 (41%) of 66 patients. Ten had exon 19 deletion, and 17 had L858R. Twenty-one patients harboring EGFR mutations were treated with gefitinib and were considered assessable for responses and adverse events. Nineteen patients with EGFR mutations achieved objective responses (three complete responses and 16 partial responses), resulting in an overall response rate of 90.5% (95% confidence interval, 69.6%ÔøΩÔøΩ98.8%). The median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (95% confidence interval, 6.0 mo to not reached). The median overall survival has not been reached. Common adverse events were skin toxicity, diarrhea, and elevated aminotransferases, but no pulmonary toxicity was observed. Conclusions: Detection of common EGFR mutations seems to be useful for selecting patients with NSCLC who would likely benefit from gefitinib monotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Yoshida","given":"Kimihide"},{"family":"Yatabe","given":"Yasushi"},{"family":"Park","given":"Ji Young"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Junichi"},{"family":"Horio","given":"Yoshitsugu"},{"family":"Matsuo","given":"Keitaro"},{"family":"Kosaka","given":"Takayuki"},{"family":"Mitsudomi","given":"Tetsuya"},{"family":"Hida","given":"Toyoaki"}],"citation-key":"yoshida_prospective_2007","container-title":"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer","container-title-short":"J.

This disease presents diverse cardiac complications in acute phase, such as life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, pump failure, cardiac rupture, and systemic embolism. The pathogenic mechanism of this disease is still unclear but sympathetic hyperactivity, as well as coronary vasospasm, microcirculatory disorder, and estrogen deÔ¨Åciency, have been considered as one of the most likely pathogenic mechanism.

  {"id":"yoshizato_genetic_2017","abstract":"Genetic alterations, including mutations and copy-number alterations, are central to the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes and related diseases (myelodysplasia), but their roles in allogeneic stem cell transplantation have not fully been studied in a large cohort of patients. We enrolled 797 patients who had been diagnosed with myelodysplasia at initial presentation and received transplantation via the Japan Marrow Donor Program. Targeted-capture sequencing was performed to identify mutations in 69 genes, together with copy-number alterations, whose effects on transplantation outcomes were investigated. We identified 1776 mutations and 927 abnormal copy segments among 617 patients (77.4%). In multivariate modeling using Cox proportional-hazards regression, genetic factors explained 30% of the total hazards for overall survival; clinical characteristics accounted for 70% of risk. TP53 and RAS-pathway mutations, together with complex karyotype (CK) as detected by conventional cytogenetics and/or sequencing-based analysis, negatively affected posttransplant survival independently of clinical factors. Regardless of disease subtype, TP53-mutated patients with CK were characterized by unique genetic features and associated with an extremely poor survival with frequent early relapse, whereas outcomes were substantially better in TP53-mutated patients without CK. By contrast, the effects of RAS-pathway mutations depended on disease subtype and were confined to myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs). Our results suggest that TP53 and RAS-pathway mutations predicted a dismal prognosis, when associated with CK and MDS/MPNs, respectively. However, for patients with mutated TP53 or CK alone, long-term survival could be obtained with transplantation. Clinical sequencing provides vital information for accurate prognostication in transplantation.","author":[{"family":"Yoshizato","given":"Tetsuichi"},{"family":"Nannya","given":"Yasuhito"},{"family":"Atsuta","given":"Yoshiko"},{"family":"Shiozawa","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Iijima-Yamashita","given":"Yuka"},{"family":"Yoshida","given":"Kenichi"},{"family":"Shiraishi","given":"Yuichi"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Hiromichi"},{"family":"Nagata","given":"Yasunobu"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Kakiuchi","given":"Nobuyuki"},{"family":"Matsuo","given":"Keitaro"},{"family":"Onizuka","given":"Makoto"},{"family":"Kataoka","given":"Keisuke"},{"family":"Chiba","given":"Kenichi"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Hiroko"},{"family":"Ueno","given":"Hiroo"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Przychodzen","given":"Bartlomiej P"},{"family":"Haferlach","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Kern","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Aoki","given":"Kosuke"},{"family":"Itonaga","given":"Hidehiro"},{"family":"Kanda","given":"Yoshinobu"},{"family":"Sekeres","given":"Mikkael A."},{"family":"Maciejewski","given":"Jaroslaw P."},{"family":"Haferlach","given":"Torsten"},{"family":"Miyazaki","given":"Yasushi"},{"family":"Horibe","given":"Keizo"},{"family":"Sanada","given":"Masashi"},{"family":"Miyano","given":"Satoru"},{"family":"Makishima","given":"Hideki"},{"family":"Ogawa","given":"Seishi"}],"citation-key":"yoshizato_genetic_2017","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2016-12-754796","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"2347-2358","title":"Genetic abnormalities in myelodysplasia and secondary acute myeloid leukemia: impact on outcome of stem cell transplantation.","type":"article-journal","volume":"129"},

Long-term daily subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin has been standard treatment for such patients. The purpose of this study was to assess if an oral factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, would offer an alternative treatment for VTE in patients with cancer. Patient and Methods In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, pilot trial in the United Kingdom, patients with active cancer who had symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), incidental PE, or symptomatic lowerextremity proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were recruited. Allocation was to dalteparin (200 IU/kg daily during month 1, then 150 IU/kg daily for months 2-6) or rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, then 20 mg once daily for a total of 6 months). The primary outcome was VTE recurrence over 6 months. Safety was assessed by major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB). A sample size of 400 patients would provide estimates of VTE recurrence to within 6 4.5%, assuming a VTE recurrence rate at 6 months of 10%.\nResults A total of 203 patients were randomly assigned to each group, 58% of whom had metastases. Twenty-six patients experienced recurrent VTE (dalteparin, n = 18; rivaroxaban, n = 8). The 6-month cumulative VTE recurrence rate was 11% (95% CI, 7% to 16%) with dalteparin and 4% (95% CI, 2% to 9%) with rivaroxaban (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.99). The 6-month cumulative rate of major bleeding was 4% (95% CI, 2% to 8%) for dalteparin and 6% (95% CI, 3% to 11%) for rivaroxaban (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.68 to 4.96).

TF-MPs from cancer cells induce increase in TF expression and procoagulant activity of recipient endothelial cells. Drug resistance microparticles transfer between cancer cells, resulting in induction of recipient cell drug resistance, however transfer of TF-MPs between cancer cells has not been demonstrated. Aim: To determine if microparticles isolated from TF expressing cancer cell lines can induced TF-mediated procoagulant activity in cell lines that do not express TF. Materials and Methods: A7 cells (a melanoma cell line that does not express TF) were transformed to express TF with adenoviral transformation. In addition, the TF-expressing breast cancer cell line MDAMB231 was used. Media was collected from (1) wild-type A7 (A7-WT) cells, which acted as control (2) MDAMB231 cells, (3) A7 cells transformed with ‚Äòlow‚Äô levels of TFadenovirus and (4) A7 cells transformed with ‚Äòhigh‚Äô levels of TF-adenovirus. MPs were isolated from media by centrifugation using standard techniques. Isolated MPs were incubated with wild-type A7 (A7-WT) cells overnight. Pro-coagulant activity of A7-WT cells was assessed using a FXa generation assay.\nResults: i) A7-WT cells incubated overnight with MDAMB231-derived MPs produced an almost 5 fold increase in procoagulant activity compared to control (Mean 3.5 mOD/min S.E 0.32 vs control 0.68 S.E. 0.05, p<0.01). ii) MPs released from A7-TF cells induced a dose-dependant increase in cell based procoagulant activity when incubated with A7-WTs compared to control:A7-WT cells incubated with control MPs (Control): mean mOD 0.83, S.E. 0.07A7-WT cells incubated with A7-TF derived MPs (low levels of TF-adenovirus): mean mOD 1.27, S.E. 0.06 (p=0.04 vs control)A7-WT cells incubated with A7-TF derived MPs (low levels of TF-adenovirus): mean mOD 2.77, S.E. 0.23 (p<0.01 vs control).\nConclusions: These results demonstrate, for the first time, microparticlemediated transfer of TF procoagulant activity between cancer cells. MPs shed by cancer cells in vivo have been implicated in cancer cell progression and hypercoagulability. The acquisition and spread of of MP-mediated TF activity has implications for cancer cell biology and cancer-induced hypercoagulability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"A."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"J."},{"family":"Hancocks","given":"H."},{"family":"Hill","given":"C."},{"family":"Joshi","given":"N."},{"family":"Marshall","given":"A."},{"family":"Grumett","given":"J."},{"family":"Dunn","given":"J.A."},{"family":"Lokare","given":"A."},{"family":"Chapman","given":"O."}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"young_oc11_2016","container-title":"Thrombosis Research","container-title-short":"Thrombosis Research","DOI":"10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30128-1","ISSN":"00493848","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4]]},"language":"en","page":"S172-S173","source":"10.407","title":"OC-11 - Anticoagulation therapy in selected cancer patients at risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049384816301281","volume":"140"},

However, acquired resistance invariably develops, and rebiopsy of patients with clinical progression has elucidated EGFR T790M mutation as the major resistance mechanism.1 To address this clinical challenge, third-generation pyrimidine-based EGFR TKIs have been designed to have selectivity for EGFR T790M over wild-type EGFR.2 They form a covalent bond with cysteine 797 in the adenosine triphosphateÔøΩÂºéinding cleft. Early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy in patients with double-mutant tumors (EGFR L858R/T790M and ex19del/T790M) and acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors.3 Specificity for EGFR T790M may be the result of hydrophobic interactions between the bulky methionine moiety of EGFR T790M and these pyrimidine-based drugs. Mechanisms of resistance to these third-generation EGFR TKIs have been identified in preclinical in vitro models, but none have so far been identified in patients. Mutations at the EGFR C797 codon, located within the kinase-binding site, are a predicted resistance mechanism to irreversible EGFR inhibitors also confirmed in vitro.4 Loss of the potential for covalent bond formation at position 797 by the missense mutation C797S results in a markedly reduced cellular potency of this class of TKIs.5 Interestingly, an analogous cysteine-to-serine mutation is a mechanism of resistance to the irreversible Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.6","author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Helena A."},{"family":"Tian","given":"Shaozhou K."},{"family":"Drilon","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Borsu","given":"Laetitia"},{"family":"Riely","given":"Gregory J."},{"family":"Arcila","given":"Maria E."},{"family":"Ladanyi","given":"Marc"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"yu_acquired_2015","container-title":"JAMA oncology","container-title-short":"JAMA Oncol.","DOI":"10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.1066","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"982-984","source":"28.4","title":"Acquired Resistance of EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer to a T790M-Specific EGFR Inhibitor: Emergence of a Third Mutation (C797S) in the EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Domain","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},

Smaller series have identified various mechanisms of resistance, but systematic evaluation of a large number of patients to definitively establish the frequency of various mechanisms has not been conducted. Experimental Design: Patients with lung adenocarcinomas and acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib enrolled onto a prospective biopsy protocol and underwent a rebiopsy after the development of acquired resistance. Histology was reviewed. Samples underwent genotyping for mutations in EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, NRAS and PIK3CA , and FISH for MET and HER2 . Results: Adequate tumor samples for molecular analysis were obtained in 155 patients. Ninety-eight had second-site EGFR T790M mutations [63%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 55%ÔøΩÔøΩ70%] and four had small cell transformation (3%, 95% CI, 0%ÔøΩÔøΩ6%).

  {"id":"yu_phase_2022","abstract":"9007\n            Background: EGFR ins20-mutant NSCLC has historically been challenging to treat. While new agents targeting EGFR ins20 have recently been approved, adverse events (AEs), particularly wild type (WT) EGFR-related AEs are common. CLN-081 is a novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with broad activity against EGFR mutations, including ins20, and increased selectivity for ins20 versus WT EGFR. CLN-081 has been granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of pts with EGFR ins20 NSCLC. We present updated results of the initial multicenter Ph1/2a study of CLN-081 in pts with advanced, EGFR ins20-mutant NSCLC, including 39 pts treated in an expanded cohort at the dose of 100 mg twice daily (BID). Methods: Ph1 dose escalation utilized an accelerated titration (AT) and rolling six design. Individual cohorts were expanded in Phase 1 and 2a based on prespecified protocol criteria. Pts were required to have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Stable, treated brain metastasis (mets) were allowed. CLN-081 is dosed in 21-day cycles. Results: As of 13 December 2021, 73 pts [median age: 65 (36-82), median lines of prior therapy: 2 (1-9), 28 (39%) with a history of brain mets] received CLN-081 at 30 mg (8), 45 mg (1), 65 mg (14), 100 mg (39), and 150 mg (11), all BID. Treatment-related AEs in ‚â• 15% of pts were rash (74%), diarrhea (27%), paronychia (25%), fatigue (19%), anemia (18%), dry skin (18%), nausea (16%). Treatment-related Gr ‚â• 3 AEs in ‚â• 4 % of pts included anemia (10%), increased ALT (4%), and increased AST (4%). Gr 3 rash and Gr 3 diarrhea were observed in 1 and 2 pts, respectively, at 150 mg BID, while no pts treated at ‚â§ 100 mg BID experienced Gr 3 rash or diarrhea. Treatment-related dose reductions and discontinuations across all dose levels occurred in 10 pts (14%) and 5 pts (7%) respectively. Among 70 response-evaluable pts across all dose levels, 25 (36%) had a confirmed partial response (PR), 34 (49%) had stable disease (SD), and 3 (4%) had progressive disease as a best response. Seven pts (10%) had a PR that remained unconfirmed; 1 (1%) pt was pending a confirmatory scan. Of 36 response-evaluable pts at 100 mg BID, 14 (39%) had a confirmed PR, 17 (47%) had SD, and 1 (3%) had PD. Three pts had a PR that remained unconfirmed (8%); 1 (3%) pt was pending a confirmatory scan. Notably, among Ph1 pts treated at 100 mg BID (N = 13) in whom longer follow-up is available, the mDOR and mPFS (estimated by Kaplan-Meier) was > 15 months and 12 months, respectively. Disease control (SD ‚â• 6 months or any PR) was observed in 12/13 pts (92%). Updated data with additional follow-up will be presented. Conclusions: In pts with heavily-pretreated advanced EGFR ins20 NSCLC, CLN-081 has a manageable safety profile, with anti-tumor activity across the range of doses tested. Further, CLN-081 has demonstrated a favorable clinical profile at the dose of 100 mg BID, with an encouraging objective response rate, response durability, and no Gr 3 rash or diarrhea.

  {"id":"yuki_klc1alk_2012","abstract":"The promising results of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors have changed the significance of ALK fusions in several types of cancer. These fusions are no longer mere research targets or diagnostic markers, but they are now directly linked to the therapeutic benefit of patients. However, most available tumor tissues in clinical settings are formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE), and this significantly limits detailed genetic studies in many clinical cases. Although recent technical improvements have allowed the analysis of some known mutations in FFPE tissues, identifying unknown fusion genes by using only FFPE tissues remains difficult. We developed a 5ÔøΩÔøΩ-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-based system optimized for FFPE tissues and evaluated this system on a lung cancer tissue with ALK rearrangement and without the 2 known ALK fusions EML4-ALK and KIF5B-ALK. With this system, we successfully identified a novel ALK fusion, KLC1-ALK. The result was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Then, we synthesized the putative full-length cDNA of KLC1-ALK and demonstrated the transforming potential of the fusion kinase with assays using mouse 3T3 cells. To the best of our knowledge, KLC1-ALK is the first novel oncogenic fusion identified using only FFPE tissues.

However, fusion genes can be successfully detected at the transcription level and with higher sensitivity using RNA-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This study compared the performance of RT-PCR and NGS in the detection of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion in Chinese patients with NSCLC. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 153 patients who were pathologically diagnosed as having NSCLC were collected from November 2017 to October 2019. Both DNA/RNA-based NGS and RNA-based RT-PCR were used to detect EML4-ALK fusion. For samples with discordant ALK status results, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or Sanger sequencing was used to further confirm the ALK status. In total, 124 samples were successfully analyzed using both NGS and RT-PCR. For 118 samples, results were consistent between NGS and RT-PCR, with 25 reported as ALK fusion positive and 93 as ALK fusion negative, achieving a concordance rate of 95.16%. Among the six samples with disconcordant results, five were positive using RT-PCR but negative using NGS, and one was positive using NGS but negative using RT-PCR. Four of six cases with disconcordant results (three RT-PCR positive and one NGS positive) were successfully validated using either FISH or Sanger sequencing.

  {"id":"yun_t790m_2008","abstract":"Lung cancers caused by activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are initially responsive to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the efficacy of these agents is often limited because of the emergence of drug resistance conferred by a second mutation, T790M. Threonine 790 is the \"gatekeeper\" residue, an important determinant of inhibitor specificity in the ATP binding pocket. The T790M mutation has been thought to cause resistance by sterically blocking binding of TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib, but this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that it remains sensitive to structurally similar irreversible inhibitors. Here, we show by using a direct binding assay that T790M mutants retain low-nanomolar affinity for gefitinib. Furthermore, we show that the T790M mutation activates WT EGFR and that introduction of the T790M mutation increases the ATP affinity of the oncogenic L858R mutant by more than an order of magnitude. The increased ATP affinity is the primary mechanism by which the T790M mutation confers drug resistance. Crystallographic analysis of the T790M mutant shows how it can adapt to accommodate tight binding of diverse inhibitors, including the irreversible inhibitor HKI-272, and also suggests a structural mechanism for catalytic activation. We conclude that the T790M mutation is a \"generic\" resistance mutation that will reduce the potency of any ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and that irreversible inhibitors overcome this resistance simply through covalent binding, not as a result of an alternative binding mode.","author":[{"family":"Yun","given":"Cai-Hong"},{"family":"Mengwasser","given":"Kristen E."},{"family":"Toms","given":"Angela V."},{"family":"Woo","given":"Michele S."},{"family":"Greulich","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Kwok-Kin"},{"family":"Meyerson","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Eck","given":"Michael J."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"yun_t790m_2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc.

Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372), a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR-MET, has shown preclinical activity in TKI-sensitive EGFR-mutated NSCLC models and in an ongoing first-in-human study in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the activity of amivantamab in Exon20ins-driven tumors has not yet been described. Ba/F3 cells and patient-derived cells/organoids/xenograft models harboring diverse Exon20ins were used to characterize the antitumor mechanism of amivantamab. Amivantamab inhibited proliferation by effectively downmodulating EGFR-MET levels and inducing immune-directed antitumor activity with increased IFNŒ≥ secretion in various models. Importantly, in vivo efficacy of amivantamab was superior to cetuximab or poziotinib, an experimental Exon20ins-targeted TKI. Amivantamab produced robust tumor responses in two Exon20ins patients, highlighting the important translational nature of this preclinical work.

BCR/ABL is characterized by deregulated and constitutively activated ABL tyrosine kinase activity that determines its transformation potential. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have greatly improved the overall prognosis of these diseases, particularly by altering the natural history of chronic phase (CP) CML and preventing the previously inexorable progression to terminal blast crisis (BC). However, unsatisfactory responses in advanced disease stages, resistance and long-term tolerability of BCR/ABL inhibitors represent major clinical problems. The most important mechanism of resistance against TKIs is the selection of leukemic clones driven by BCR/ABL harboring point mutations, such as the E255K, Y253F/H (P-loop), H396R (activation loop) or the T315I (gatekeeper). The \"gatekeeper\" mutation T315I confers resistance against all approved TKIs, with the only exception of Ponatinib, a multi-target kinase inhibitor. CML and Ph+ ALL, rarely present at diagnosis with a BCR/ABL harboring a resistance mutation to TKI. Resistant clones may be present and only detectable by highly sensitive methods. We have previously shown that the resistance mutations may influence the biology of BCR/ABL and its transformation potential.We therefore hypothesized that the presence of mutations such as the T315I select for a \"dormant cell population\" which manifests following initial treatments with TKI inhibitors and treatment failure. The aim of this study was to determine whether the ''gatekeeper'' mutation T315I is able to confer biological features to BCR/ABL influencing its leukemogenic potential.We investigated the influence of T315I on the biology of BCR/ABL in CML and Ph+ ALL. We used Ph+ ALL patient derived long term culture (PDLTCs), factor dependent Ba/F3 cells and syngeneic mouse model of BCR/ABL induced CML-like disease. These models allowed the direct comparison of BCR/ABL with BCR/ABL-T315I. We observed significantly slower proliferation of Ba/F3 cells and PDLTCs expressing BCR/ABL-T315I compared to the native BCR/ABL. This was further confirmed by undertaking mitotic index calculations and colony formation assays on both cell types. Furthermore, the induction of a CML-like disease in syngeneic mice was significantly delayed in the presence of T315I (median: BCR/ABL - 27 days; BCR/ABL-T315I - 61 days). We undertook functional studies to determine the putative signaling pathway and found that Ras/Erk1/2 pathway was activated inT315I positive cells.This study may assist towards therapy decisions in patients with CML/Ph+ ALL with a T315I mutation.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Zafar","given":"Usva"},{"family":"Yusuf","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Chakraborty","given":"Rikhia"},{"family":"Lalani","given":"El-Nasir M A"},{"family":"Mian","given":"Afsar Ali"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"zafar_gatekeeper_2019","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2019-131694","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"Supplement_1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,13]]},"language":"en","page":"5196","source":"25.476","title":"The ''gatekeeper'' mutation T315I in BCR/ABL confers additional oncogenic activities to philadelphia chromosome positive leukemia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-131694","volume":"134"},

Trop-2 is an ideal candidate for targeted therapeutics due to it being a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain overexpressed on a wide variety of tumors as well as its upregulated expression relative to normal cells. As a result, several Trop-2-targeted therapeutics have recently been developed for clinical use, such as anti-Trop-2 antibodies and Trop-2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Subsequently, multiple early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated safety and clinical benefit of Trop-2-based ADCs across multiple tumor types.

We evaluated ipilimumab plus nivolumab compared with nivolumab alone in women with persistent or recurrent EOC.\n\nMETHODS\n\nEligibility criteria included measurable disease, 1-3 prior regimens, and platinum-free interval (PFI) < 12 months. Participants were randomly allocated to intravenous nivolumab (every 2 weeks) or induction with nivolumab plus ipilimumab for 4 doses (every 3 weeks), followed by every-2-week maintenance nivolumab for a maximum of 42 doses. The primary null hypothesis was equal probability of objective response within 6 months of random allocation in each arm.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOne hundred patients were allocated to receive either nivolumab (n = 49), or nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n = 51), with PFI of < 6 months in 62%.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of the Bim deletion polymorphism among patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive or ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1)-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib. METHODS A total of 55 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and 14 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib were enrolled into the current study. The Bim deletion polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The clinical features of the Bim deletion polymorphism and its impact on the effect of crizotinib were investigated. RESULTS The Bim deletion polymorphism was present in 9 of 69 patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC (13.0%). There were no differences noted with regard to clinicopathological features between patients with and without the Bim deletion polymorphism. Patients with the Bim deletion polymorphism had a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and lower objective response rate compared with those without (median PFS, 182 days vs 377 days [P = .008]) (objective response rate, 44.4% vs 81.7% [P =.041]) in all populations.

  {"id":"zhang_potent_2016","abstract":"Purpose: NonÔøΩ¶Ω≥mall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring ALK gene rearrangements (ALK+) typically become resistant to the first-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib through development of secondary resistance mutations in ALK or disease progression in the brain. Mutations that confer resistance to second-generation ALK TKIs ceritinib and alectinib have also been identified. Here, we report the structure and first comprehensive preclinical evaluation of the next-generation ALK TKI brigatinib. Experimental Design: A kinase screen was performed to evaluate the selectivity profile of brigatinib. The cellular and in vivo activities of ALK TKIs were compared using engineered and cancer-derived cell lines. The brigatinibÔøΩ®ØóLK co-structure was determined. Results: Brigatinib potently inhibits ALK and ROS1, with a high degree of selectivity over more than 250 kinases. Across a panel of ALK+ cell lines, brigatinib inhibited native ALK (IC50, 10 nmol/L) with 12-fold greater potency than crizotinib. Superior efficacy of brigatinib was also observed in mice with ALK+ tumors implanted subcutaneously or intracranially. Brigatinib maintained substantial activity against all 17 secondary ALK mutants tested in cellular assays and exhibited a superior inhibitory profile compared with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib at clinically achievable concentrations. Brigatinib was the only TKI to maintain substantial activity against the most recalcitrant ALK resistance mutation, G1202R. The unique, potent, and pan-ALK mutant activity of brigatinib could be rationalized by structural analyses. Conclusions: Brigatinib is a highly potent and selective ALK inhibitor. These findings provide the molecular basis for the promising activity being observed in ALK+, crizotinib-resistant patients with NSCLC being treated with brigatinib in clinical trials.

Subsequently, the patient received combination therapy of osimertinib and bevacizumab; the partial relief obtained was negated by later disease progression. The regimen was then changed to osimertinib, bevacizumab, and brigatinib combination therapy. Partial remission was observed, and a significant reduction in EGFR mutations was detected. This case represents the first evidence that 1) bevacizumab combined with osimertinib can significantly relieve tumor growth and respiratory symptoms in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with osimertinib resistance and 2) the clinical use of osimertinib, bevacizumab, and brigatinib is effective as combination therapy for pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the presence of triple EGFR mutations of L858R, T790M, and cis-C797S. These combination therapies may provide potential novel treatment options for pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Jinyan"},{"family":"Han","given":"Yingmin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guangzhi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Gang"}],"call-number":"3","citation-key":"zhao_effective_2018","container-title":"OncoTargets and therapy","container-title-short":"OncoTargets Ther.","DOI":"10.2147/ott.s170358","issue":"NA","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"5545-5550","source":"4","title":"Effective treatment of pulmonary adenocarcinoma harboring triple EGFR mutations of L858R, T790M, and cis-C797S by osimertinib, bevacizumab, and brigatinib combination therapy: a case report","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

Despite impressive initial tumor responses, development of drug resistance ultimately limits the benefit of this compound. Mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib are just beginning to emerge, such as EGFR C797S and L718Q mutations, BRAF V600E and PIK3CA E545K mutations, as well as ERBB2 and MET amplification. However, a comprehensive view is still missing. In this study, we presented the first case of Chinese NSCLC patient who developed resistance to osimertinib, and discovered de novo EGFR G796D mutation as a potential mechanism. Our findings provided insights into mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib and highlighted tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution during the development of drug resistance.","author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Di"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Min"},{"family":"Bai","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xuehua"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Xuesong"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Chunyan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiying"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Li"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Ni","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhenfan"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jianfang"}],"citation-key":"zheng_egfr_2017","container-title":"Oncotarget","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.17913","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"49671-49679","title":"EGFR G796D mutation mediates resistance to osimertinib","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

According to updated ALK testing guidelines from the College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Association for Molecular Pathology published in 2018, ALK immunohistochemistry is formally an alternative to ALK FISH, and simultaneous detection of multiple hot spots, including, at least, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET, ERBB2, BRAF and KRAS genes is also recommended while performing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing. Therefore, ALK status in a specimen can be tested by different methods and platforms, even in the same institution or laboratory. In this review, we discuss several clinically relevant technical aspects of ALK FISH, including pros and cons of the unique two-step (50- to 100-cell) analysis approach employed in the Vysis Break Apart ALK FISH assay, including: the preset cutoff value of ÔøΩÔøΩ15% for a positive result; technical aspects and biology of discordant results obtained by different methods; and incidental findings, such as ALK copy number gain or amplification and co-existent driver mutations.

  {"id":"zhou_alectinib_2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK-positive) disease occurs in approximately 5% of all patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, with a similar incidence reported in Asian patients. This study is the first phase 3 randomised trial recruiting only Asian patients to compare alectinib with crizotinib as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with 600 mg of alectinib twice per day. This study assessed consistency of the progression-free survival benefit with the global phase 3 ALEX study.\nMETHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 21 investigational sites in China, South Korea, and Thailand, Asian patients, aged 18 years or older, with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) to twice-daily oral alectinib (600 mg) or crizotinib (250 mg). Patients were randomly assigned via a block-stratified (block size three) randomisation procedure, done centrally via an interactive voice or web response system, with stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and baseline CNS metastases. Clinical staff and the funder's drug safety and medical monitoring staff had access to treatment assignments. The independent review committee was masked to treatment assignment, and funder personnel did not have access to efficacy and safety summaries by treatment group, before the formal reporting of study results. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were permitted. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The primary analysis population for efficacy was the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomly assigned patients. The primary analysis population for safety was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02838420.\nFINDINGS: Between Aug 3, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 187 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 125 to alectinib and 62 to crizotinib. Median follow-up was 16¬∑2 months (IQR 13¬∑7-17¬∑6) in the alectinib group, and 15¬∑0 months (12¬∑5-17¬∑3) in the crizotinib group. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with alectinib versus crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0¬∑22, 95% CI 0¬∑13-0¬∑38; p<0¬∑0001; median progression-free survival not estimable vs 11¬∑1 months). Independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the alectinib group compared with the crizotinib group (HR 0¬∑37, 0¬∑22-0¬∑61; p<0¬∑0001). The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 114 (91%) of 125 with alectinib, and 48 (77%) of 62 with crizotinib, with a longer duration of response for alectinib than crizotinib (HR 0¬∑22, 95% CI 0¬∑12-0¬∑40; p<0¬∑0001). Time to CNS progression (cause-specific HR 0¬∑14) and the percentage of patients who achieved a CNS objective response with measurable or non-measurable baseline CNS lesions were improved (32 [73%] of 44 patients treated with alectinib vs five [22%] of 23 patients treated with crizotinib). Despite longer treatment duration with alectinib than crizotinib (14¬∑7 months vs 12¬∑6 months, respectively), fewer patients had grade 3-5 adverse events (36 [29%] of 125 vs 30 [48%] of 62, respectively) or serious adverse events (19 [15%] of 125 vs 16 [26%] of 62, respectively).\nINTERPRETATION: Our results align with ALEX, confirming the clinical benefit of 600 mg of alectinib twice per day as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.\nFUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Caicun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sang-We"},{"family":"Reungwetwattana","given":"Thanyanan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jianying"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yiping"},{"family":"He","given":"Jianxing"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jin-Ji"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Se-Hoon"},{"family":"Bu","given":"Lilian"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Morcos","given":"Peter N."},{"family":"Lu","given":"You"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Li"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"zhou_alectinib_2019","container-title":"The Lancet.

Methods Patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC harbouring EGFR-mutation were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive either combination with erlotinib (150 mg daily) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg iv q3w) or erlotinib (150 mg daily). Random assignment was stratified by sex (female/male), disease stage (stage IIIb vs. stage IV vs. recurrence), and EGFR gene mutation (exon 19 deletion vs. exon 21 L858R). The primary endpoint was Progression-free survival (PFS), as determined by an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints were PFS by investigator, tumor response (by IRC and investigator), overall survival (OS), time to failure (TTF), safety, patient-reported outcome (PRO) and exploratory biomarker analysis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a 448-gene panel and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used for resistance biomarker analysis of paired frozen tissue samples. Results From Mar 31, 2016 to Jul 26, 2017, 311 patients from 14 centers across China were randomized to receive BE (N = 157) or E (N = 154). Median follow-up time was 22 months for BE and 21.5 months for E. Baseline characteristics were well balanced in each arm. The median PFS by IRC was 18.0 months (95% CI 15.2-20.7) in BE and 11.3 months (95%CI 9.8-13.8) in E (p Conclusions As compared with E alone, B plus E showed superior efficacy with acceptable tolerability.

However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the \"program,\" optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 19/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE. We show that APE-engineered prompts can be applied to steer models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness, as well as to improve few-shot learning performance by simply prepending them to standard in-context learning prompts.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 3-part, open-label, phase 1/2 nonrandomized clinical trial with dose-escalation/dose-expansion cohorts (28 sites in the US) and a single-arm extension cohort (EXCLAIM; 39 sites in Asia, Europe, and North America) was conducted between June 2016 and November 2020 (data cutoff date). The primary analysis populations were the platinum-pretreated patients (PPP) cohort and the EXCLAIM cohort. The PPP cohort included 114 patients with platinum-pretreated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC who received mobocertinib 160 mg once daily from the dose-escalation (n = 6), dose-expansion (n = 22), and EXCLAIM (n = 86) cohorts. The EXCLAIM cohort included 96 patients with previously treated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC (10 were not platinum pretreated and thus were excluded from the PPP cohort). INTERVENTIONS Mobocertinib 160 mg once daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point of the PPP and EXCLAIM cohorts was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent review committee (IRC). Secondary end points included confirmed ORR by investigator, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.\nRESULTS Among the PPP (n = 114) and EXCLAIM (n = 96) cohorts, the median (range) age was 60 (27-84) and 59 (27-80) years, respectively; most patients were women (75 [66%] and 62 [65%], respectively) and of Asian race (68 [60%] and 66 [69%], respectively). At data cutoff, median follow-up was 14.2 months in the PPP cohort (median 2 prior anticancer regimens; 40 [35%] had baseline brain metastases), with confirmed ORR of 28% (95% CI, 20%-37%) by IRC assessment and 35% (95% CI, 26%-45%) by investigator assessment; median duration of response by IRC assessment was 17.5 months (95% CI, 7.4-20.3).

Here we report a case of emergent MET amplification detected in a tumor sample from a patient with NSCLC harboring EGFR L858R mutation after disease progression on erlotinib. The patient subsequently had a sustained partial response to a combination of full-dose osimertinib and crizotinib with excellent tolerance but eventually had central nervous system (CNS) progression. Comprehensive genomic profiling performed on the resected brain sample continued to demonstrate MET amplification as an acquired resistance mechanism. A review of literature shows several groups have utilized similar combination regimens (erlotinib or osimertinib + crizotinib or cabozantinib), albeit with various dosing to target MET alterations in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. As more actionable resistance mechanisms are identified, we envision combination TKI therapy will be readily adopted in clinical practice. Our case report adds to a growing body of evidence that combination osimertinib and crizotinib should be recommended to EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with emergent MET amplification as acquired resistance. More importantly, as crizotinib has limited brain penetration, developing next-generation MET inhibitors with better CNS activity is urgently needed.","author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Viola W."},{"family":"Schrock","given":"Alexa B."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Siraj M."},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"}],"citation-key":"zhu_differential_2019","container-title":"Lung Cancer (Auckland, N.Z.)","container-title-short":"Lung Cancer Auckl.

In this study, we establish a smartphone app that assesses patient bowel preparation using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction system trained on labeled photographs of feces in the toilet and evaluate its impact on bowel preparation quality in colonoscopy outpatients. We conduct a prospective, single-masked, multicenter randomized clinical trial, enrolling outpatients who own a smartphone and are scheduled for a colonoscopy. We screen 578 eligible patients and randomize 524 in a 1:1 ratio to the control or AI-driven app group for bowel preparation. The study endpoints are the percentage of patients with adequate bowel preparation and the total BBPS score, compliance with dietary restrictions and purgative instructions, polyp detection rate, and adenoma detection rate (secondary). The prediction system has an accuracy of 95.15%, a specificity of 97.25%, and an area under the curve of 0.98 in the test dataset. In the full analysis set (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ500), adequate preparation is significantly higher in the AI-driven app group (88.54 vs. 65.59%; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). The mean BBPS score is 6.74‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.25 in the AI-driven app group and 5.97‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.81 in the control group (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). The rates of compliance with dietary restrictions (93.68 vs. 83.81%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001) and purgative instructions (96.05 vs. 84.62%, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) are significantly higher in the AI-driven app group, as is the rate of additional purgative intake (26.88 vs. 17.41%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.011). Thus, our AI-driven smartphone app significantly improves the quality of bowel preparation and patient compliance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dan-Feng"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Hui-Li"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Pei-Yao"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhuang","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Zi-Han"},{"family":"Li","given":"Kun-Kun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiao-Hong"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Bo-Qun"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Wen-Zheng"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Sheng-Li"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Tian-Yin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xiao-Yue"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jing-Zheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuo"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Quan-Lin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ping-Hong"}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"zhu_improving_2023","container-title":"npj Digital Medicine","container-title-short":"npj Digit.

Three-dimensional computer modeling of this double mutation and other G1202R-based double mutations with lorlatinib (ALK G1202R/L1196M, ALK G1202R/F1174C, ALK G1202R/l1198F, ALK G1202R/G1269A) were provided to reveal how these double mutations may confer resistance to lorlatinib through diverse steric hindrances in the ALK kinase domain. In addition, we performed a comprehensive literature review on published acquired double or triple ALK mutations that are resistant to lorlatinib from both patient samples and in vitro mutagenesis experiments.","author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Viola W."},{"family":"Nagasaka","given":"Misako"},{"family":"Madison","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Schrock","given":"Alexa B."},{"family":"Cui","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Sai-Hong Ignatius"}],"citation-key":"zhu_novel_2020","container-title":"JTO clinical and research reports","container-title-short":"JTO Clin.

  {"id":"zou_orally_2007","abstract":"The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), have been implicated in the progression of several human cancers and are attractive therapeutic targets. PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.","author":[{"family":"Zou","given":"Helen Y."},{"family":"Li","given":"Qiuhua"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Joseph H."},{"family":"Arango","given":"Maria E."},{"family":"McDonnell","given":"Scott Rp"},{"family":"Yamazaki","given":"Shinji"},{"family":"Koudriakova","given":"Tatiana B."},{"family":"Alton","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Jingrong Jean"},{"family":"Kung","given":"Pei Pei"},{"family":"David","given":"Nambu Mitchell"},{"family":"Los","given":"Gerrit"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Bender Steven"},{"family":"Mroczkowski","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"James G."}],"call-number":"1","citation-key":"zou_orally_2007","container-title":"Cancer research","container-title-short":"Cancer Res.","DOI":"10.1158/0008-5472.can-06-4443","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"4408-4417","source":"11.2","title":"An orally available small-molecule inhibitor of c-met, PF-2341066, exhibits cytoreductive antitumor efficacy through antiproliferative and antiangiogenic mechanisms","type":"article-journal","volume":"67"},

  {"id":"zucca_longterm_2023","abstract":"Background:The Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) and the Nordic Lymphoma Group (NLG) conducted the SAKK 35/10 randomized phase-2 trial (NCT0137605) to compare the effectiveness of rituximab (R) alone versus R combined with lenalidomide (L) as the initial treatment for symptomatic follicular lymphoma (FL). The primary endpoint analysis, which demonstrated higher complete remission (CR) rates with the combination therapy, was previously reported (Zucca et al. Blood 2019). This report provides a long-term analysis of time-to-event endpoints with a median follow-up of approximately 10 years. Methods:A total of 154 eligible patients with untreated grade 1 to 3a FL requiring systemic therapy were centrally randomized to receive either R monotherapy (375 mg/m2 IV on day 1 of weeks 1-4 and repeated during weeks 12-15 for responding patients) or R+L. In the combination arm, R was administered at the same schedule as the monotherapy, while L was taken orally at a daily dose of 15 mg, starting 14 days before the first R administration, and continued until 14 days after the last R administration, for a total of 18 weeks. Random assignment to treatment arms was stratified based on histological grade (1-2 vs 3a), bulky disease (<6 vs ‚â•6 cm), Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score (1-2 vs ‚â•3), and centre, using the minimization method. The sample size was determined to detect a 20% increase in the CR/CRu rate with 90% power, using a one-sided Z-test with a false positive rate of 10% to compare the two treatment arms. The assessed endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT), duration of CR/CRu (DoR), and overall survival (OS), were defined according to NCI international standardized criteria (Cheson et al. J Clin Oncol 1999). Results:Seventy-seven patients (median age 63 years, 52% with stage IV and 47% with poor-risk FLIPI score) were assigned to the single-agent rituximab arm, and 77 patients (median age 61 years, 48% with stage IV and 47% with poor-risk FLIPI score) were assigned to the combination arm. The results for the primary endpoint were consistent with the positive initial analysis. At a median follow-up of 9.5 years, the overall survival was similar in both arms (77% vs. 78% at 10 years, p=0.881). However, significant, and sustained improvements were seen in all other time-to-event endpoints. Patients in the R+L arm had a longer PFS (median, 9.3 vs. 2.3 years; HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.89; p=0.013) and TTNT (median, not reached vs. 2.1 years; HR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.27-0.67; p<0.001). DoR with R+L was also longer (median not reached vs 3.2 years with R only; HR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.86; p=0.014) and with over 60% of responders still in first remission at 10 years. The improved outcomes with R+L were not associated with unexpected toxicity. Grade ‚â•3 adverse events were more common with the combination regimen (56% vs. 22% of patients), with grade 3-4 neutropenia in 23% of patients receiving R+L and in 7% of those receiving R alone. Fatigue, diarrhea, and skin rash were more frequent with R+L, but mostly of grade 1-2 (grade 3 occurred in ‚â§ 5% in both arms, and no grade 4 was reported). The side effects were manageable, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm. Two cases of biopsy-proven into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were reported in the R+L arm, and two cases of Hodgkin lymphoma were described in the R arm. Although their causal relationship with treatment is not completely clear, the number of second solid cancers was significantly higher in the R+L arm. Two cases of prostate cancer, two lung adenocarcinomas (one in situ), one small cell lung carcinoma, one rectal cancer, and four skin cancers (three squamous cell and one basal cell), were observed in the R+L arm, while only one solid tumor (prostate cancer) occurred in the R arm (p=0.09). Only one patient died of a second solid cancer (small cell lung carcinoma in the R+L arm). The rate of POD24 was 29% in the R+L arm vs. 34% in the R-arm (p=0.483). Conclusions:The long-term results of the SAKK 35/10 trial demonstrated a durable benefit for the R+L combination compared to R alone. Notably, the adopted R+L schedule is considerably shorter than the standard R2 regimen (18 vs. 120 weeks). This provides a promising alternative when treatment is required but durable immunosuppression is undesirable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zucca","given":"Emanuele"},{"family":"Schaer","given":"Saemi"},{"family":"Vanazzi","given":"Anna"},{"family":"√òstenstad","given":"Bj√∏rn"},{"family":"Mey","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Rauch","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Wahlin","given":"Bj√∂rn E."},{"family":"Hitz","given":"Felicitas"},{"family":"Hernberg","given":"Micaela"},{"family":"Johansson","given":"Ann-Sofie"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Peter de Nully"},{"family":"Hagberg","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Ferreri","given":"Andr√©s Jos√© Mar√≠a"},{"family":"Krasniqi","given":"Fatime"},{"family":"Voegeli","given":"Mich√®le"},{"family":"Novak","given":"Urban"},{"family":"Zander","given":"Thilo"},{"family":"Bersvendsen","given":"Hanne"},{"family":"Mamot","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Mingrone","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Stathis","given":"Anastasios"},{"family":"Dirnhofer","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Hayoz","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Kimby","given":"Eva"}],"citation-key":"zucca_longterm_2023","collection-title":"65th ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-173957","ISSN":"0006-4971","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"page":"295","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Long-Term Efficacy of a 6-Month Regimen of Rituximab and Lenalidomide in Follicular Lymphoma Patients in Need of First Therapy: Updated Analysis of the SAKK 35/10 Randomized Trial","title-short":"Long-Term Efficacy of a 6-Month Regimen of Rituximab and Lenalidomide in Follicular Lymphoma Patients in Need of First Therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497123048991","volume":"142"},
