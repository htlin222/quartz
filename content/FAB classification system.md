# FAB classification system

## Leukemia cell lineage

The FAB classification system begins with “M0” and runs through to “M7” as follows:

## TL;DR

- 0到5是白家，優先排除 6紅，7血小板
- 0沒分化好，1好一點 MyeB，2 有分化，3 APL，4 AMML，5 AMonoL

## Detail

- M0 to M5 leukemias:
  - These all derive from immature white blood cells.
  - M0: undifferentiated acute myeloblastic leukemia
  - M1: acute myeloblastic leukemia with minimal maturation 1點(minimal maturation)
  - M2: acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation (比1點多一點 = 2 = maturation)
  - M3: acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
  - M4: acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML)
  - M4 eos: acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (AMML w/Eos) 伊四
  - M5: acute monocytic leukemia (AMonoL)
- M6 leukemia: AEL
  - from immature cells that would eventually become red blood cells. They are called red blood cell precursor cells.
  - M6: acute erythroid leukemia
- M7 leukemia: A-MegaB-L (我亂取的 → )
  - from immature cells that would eventually develop into platelets.
  - M7: acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
