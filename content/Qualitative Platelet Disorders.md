### Qualitative Platelet Disorders

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Normal platelet count but abnormal platelet function (i.e., normal platelet number but bleeding time is elevated)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies:

-Â Â Â **Von Willebrand Disease (vWD):** Mixed platelet/coagulation disorder

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Defect or absence in vWF, which helps platelets aggregate when functioning appropriately. vWF is also a carrier for factor VIII.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Clinical features: Prolonged PTT, mucocutaneous bleeding, heavy menstrual or post-partum bleeding

-Â Â Â **Bernard-Soulier:**

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Autosomal recessive disorder. â†“GpIb defect in platelet to vWF adhesion.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Clinical features: Blood smear â€“ platelets abnormally large, platelet count mildly low. Clinically, patients have bleeding out of proportion to their platelet number (which is often normal)

-Â Â Â **Glanzmannâ€™s thrombasthenia:**

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Autosomal recessive disorder. â†“GpIIb/IIIa defect in platelet-to-platelet aggregation.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Clinical features: Normal platelet count, no platelet clumping, mucocutaneous bleeding

-Â Â Â **Acquired:** Medications (ASA, NSAIDs, antibiotics), uremia (toxins affect vWF/XIII), liver disease, bone marrow disorders, dysproteinemias (multiple myeloma), antiplatelet antibodies, cardiopulmonary bypass (partial degranulation of platelets)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Platelet transfusions, DDAVP
