# physiology of acid-base disturbances

## Proximal tubule

Reabsorbs majority of **filtered bicarbonate** (normally about 80%) Produces and secretes ammonium

## Thick ascending limb of Henleâ€™s loop

Reabsorbs most of remaining filtered bicarbonate (normally about 10%â€“15%)

## Distal nephron

- Reabsorbs virtually all remaining filtered bicarbonate as well as any secreted bicarbonate (Type A intercalated cells)
- Acidifies tubular fluid (Type A intercalated cells)
- Secretes bicarbonate (Type B intercalated cells)
- Secretes **ammonia and ammonium** (type A and non-A, non-B intercalated cells)
