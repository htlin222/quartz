# Approach to Palpable breast mass

- Involves clinical assessment, radiographic imaging, and, if necessary, biopsy
- In the case of a confirmed breast cancer diagnosis, imaging of both breasts, receptor and tumor marker testing, and staging of the mass should be performed.

## Clinical assessment

- Certain constellations of characteristics should raise suspicion for malignancy in a breast lesion and warrant further assessment.
- If the cancerous lesion is detectable by palpation, a **stage II tumor** or higher (size > 2 cm) is very likely.
- Women < 30 years of age should undergo breast ultrasound; higher breast tissue density makes **detection of breast abnormalities** with mammography more difficult.
- Women â‰¥ 30 years of age should undergo mammography.
