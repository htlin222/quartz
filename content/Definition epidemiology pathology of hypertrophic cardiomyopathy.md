# Definition epidemiology pathology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- LV (usually â‰¥15 mm) and/or RV hypertrophy disproportionate to hemodynamic load
- Due to gene mutations affecting proteins of or related to sarcomere; prev.: ~1/200-500
- Myocardial fiber disarray with hypertrophy, which creates arrhythmogenic substrate
- Many morphologic hypertrophy variants: asymmetric septal; concentric; midcavity; apical
- Ddx: LVH 2Â° to HTN, AS, elite at â†£ hletes (wall usually <13 mm & symmetric and nl/â†‘ rates of tissue Doppler diastolic relaxation; Circ 2011;123:2723), Fabry dis. (â†‘ Cr, skin findings)
