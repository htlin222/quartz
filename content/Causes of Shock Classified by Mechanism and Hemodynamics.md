[[Obstructive shock]]
[[Cardiogenic shock]]

Shown is an algorithm for the initial assessment of a patient in shock (Panel A), relative frequencies of the main types of shock (Panel B), and schematic representations of the four main types of shock (Panel C). The algorithm starts with the most common presentation (i.e., arterial hypotension), but hypotension is sometimes minimal or absent. CVP denotes central venous pressure, and Svo, mixed venous oxygen saturation.
