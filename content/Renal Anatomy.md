### Renal Anatomy





**FIGURE 6.1: Anatomy of the urinary tract and kidney**. A) The organs of the urinary system include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The function of the urinary system is to filter the blood and create urine as a waste by-product. B) The kidney has an outer region called the renal cortex and an inner region called the medulla. The renal columns are connective tissue extensions that radiate from the cortex to the medulla and separate the renal pyramids and papillae. The papillae are bundles of collecting ducts that carry urine made by the nephron to the calyces for excretion. The renal hilum is the entry and exit site for the blood vessels, nerves, lymphatics, and ureters.
