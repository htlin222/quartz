### Epilepsy

â€¢Â Â Â **Veterans Affairs Status Epilepticus Cooperative Study Group: A comparison of four treatments for generalized convulsive status.** *N Eng J Med* 1998;339(12):792â€“798.

-Â Â Â Multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial that assessed the use of four different IV antiepileptic regimens for the initial treatment of generalized convulsive status epilepticus. In this study, IV lorazepam was more effective than phenytoin.

â€¢Â Â Â **Randomized Trial of Three Anticonvulsant Medications for Status Epilepticus (ESETT).** *N Eng J Med* 2019;381:2103â€“2113.

-Â Â Â Multicenter, blinded randomized controlled trial that randomized patients with status epilepticus refractory to benzodiazepines to second-line anticonvulsive agents: levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, or valproate. All were equally efficacious with a seizure cessation rate of approximately 50%, with similar incidences of adverse events.
