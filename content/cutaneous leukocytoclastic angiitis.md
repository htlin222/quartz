# cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis

* Occurs 7–10 days after certain medications 
* (penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, phenytoin, allopurinol) or 
* infections (eg, HCV, HIV).
* Palpable purpura, no visceral involvement.
 
Immune complex–mediated leukocytoclastic vasculitis; 
late involvement indicates systemic vasculitis.

(Arthritis Rheumatol 2018;70:171)
* Most common type of vasculitis; heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes due to IC deposition in capillaries, venules, and arterioles; includes hypersensitivity vasculitis
* Etiol: drugs (PCN, ASA, amphetamines, levamisole, thiazides, chemicals, immunizations, etc.); infection (Strep, Staph, endocarditis, TB, hepatitis); malignancy (paraneoplastic)
* Clinical manifestations: abrupt onset of palpable purpura and transient arthralgias after exposure to the offending agent; visceral involvement rare but can be severe
* Dx studies: ↑ ESR, ↓ complement levels, eosinophilia; ✓ U/A; skin biopsy → leukocytoclastic vasculitis w/o IgA deposition in skin (to distinguish from IgA vasculitis); if etiology not clear, consider ANCA, cryoglobulins, hepatitis serologies, ANA, RF
* Treatment: withdrawal of offending agent ± rapid prednisone taper
