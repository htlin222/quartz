### Alveolar Hemorrhage

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Bleeding into the alveolar space due to disruption of the alveolarâ€“capillary basement membrane

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies: See Table 2.5


**TABLE 2.5 â€¢ Etiologies of Alveolar Hemorrhage Based on Mechanism**




â€¢Â Â Â Clinical presentation:

-Â Â Â Cough, fever, hemoptysis, or diffuse GGOs \+ other concerning features (e.g., extrapulmonary signs of vasculitis, known condition associated with DAH, declining hemoglobin without clear reason)

-Â Â Â Pearl: Hemoptysis is only present in 50% of cases and absence does not predict hemorrhage severity

-Â Â Â Also consider alveolar hemorrhage in a patient with GGOs who is failing to progress as expected (e.g., patient with suspected cardiogenic pulmonary edema who is not improving with diuresis)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnostics:

-Â Â Â Labs: CBC, BUN/Cr, UA, ESR, CRP. Consider rheumatologic w/u, which may include ANA, dsDNA, RNP, C3, C4, RF, CCP, ANCA, MPO, PR3, cryoglobulins, anti-GBM, RVVT, cardiolipin, B2-glycoprotein Ab

-Â Â Â Imaging: Noncontrast chest CT (consider contrast if suspect other causes of hemoptysis): Imaging shows patchy or diffuse GGOs

-Â Â Â Bronchoscopy: 1) Serial lavage â€“ gets progressively more hemorrhagic; 2) Rule out infection; 3) Check CBC with differential to evaluate for eosinophilia

â€¢Â Â Â Management:

-Â Â Â **Capillaritis**: Immunosuppression

**â€¢**Â Â Â For ANCA-associated vasculitis, typically give pulse-dose steroids first and then adjunctive therapies like cyclophosphamide, rituximab, etc. if lack of response

-Â Â Â **Bland hemorrhage** or **diffuse alveolar damage:**

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treat underlying cause, supportive care
