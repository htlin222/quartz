### Principles of Antibiotic Selection and Infection Management

â€¢Â Â Â Start antibiotics early: Early antibiotics in sepsis decrease mortality

â€¢Â Â Â Cultures before antibiotics: Whenever possible, obtain blood cultures and easily-accessible organ-specific cultures (e.g., sputum culture/urine culture) prior to starting antibiotics

â€¢Â Â Â Antibiotics before invasive procedures: In an acutely ill patient, do not delay antibiotics for time-intensive culture sampling (e.g., lumbar puncture, paracentesis, thoracentesis, intra-abdominal abscess drainage, etc.)

â€¢Â Â Â Use prior microbiology data: Prior microbiology data can help you understand the organisms with which a patient has previously been infected and the antibiotic susceptibilities of these organisms

â€¢Â Â Â Immunocompromised patients: Consider a broader differential diagnosis and broader empiric antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal coverage for immunocompromised patients

â€¢Â Â Â Obtain source control ASAP: Consider removing and/or draining potential contained sources of infection, including indwelling catheters, hardware (e.g., prosthetic joints or cardiac devices), or effusions and abscesses

â€¢Â Â Â Use cultures to guide antibiotic choice: As culture data returns, use culture data and susceptibilities to narrow antibiotics. Keep local antibiotic resistance patterns in mind
