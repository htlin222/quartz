### Intra-Abdominal Infections

##### Peritonitis/intra-abdominal abscess

•   Pathogenesis: Disruption of or inflammation in the GI tract may allow normal bowel flora to enter the abdominal cavity and cause frank peritonitis and/or the development of intra-abdominal abscesses

•   Pathogens:

-   These infections are almost always polymicrobial

-   Colonic organisms are the predominant pathogens, which include: *E. coli, Klebsiella* spp., *Proteus* spp., *Enterobacter* spp., *Enterococcus* spp., anaerobic organisms, such as *B. fragilis*

•   Clinical features:

-   Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or bloating \+/– fever, tachycardia, hypotension. Some patients may appear relatively stable, while others may have florid shock

-   Patients age 65\+ yr, immunocompromised, or those on chronic steroids may have especially occult presentations of severe intra-abdominal infections with less pronounced pain

•   Diagnosis:

-   If unstable, consult general surgery to determine the need for immediate surgical intervention vs. whether to first obtain diagnostic imaging studies (typically CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast)

•   Treatment:

-   Procedural interventions: Surgical intervention or percutaneous drainage are key aspects of management for complicated intra-abdominal infection. Consult general surgery and/or interventional radiology. Obtain cultures from drained material to guide antimicrobial management

-   Antibiotic therapy:

**•**   Start antibiotics ASAP to cover enteric Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anerobic organisms

**•**   Patients with certain risk factors are considered high-risk (age >70 yr, diffuse peritonitis, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, health care–acquired infections) and warrant coverage of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms

**•**   Regimens include:

-   Low-risk community acquired infections:

•   Ertapenem

•   Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone \+ metronidazole

-   High-risk community acquired infections or hospital-acquired infections:

•   Piperacillin-tazobactam

•   Meropenem

•   Cefepime \+ metronidazole

##### ***Clostridium difficile***

•   Pathophysiology:

-   *C. difficile* colitis can occur as a result of either community-acquired or nosocomial infections

-   Not all strains of *C. difficile* cause infection; only toxin producing strains cause diarrhea and colitis.

-   Risk factors for *C. difficile* infection include:

**•**   Recent antibiotic use (commonly implicated antibiotics include clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins)

**•**   Age ≥65 yr

**•**   Suppression of gastric acid with PPIs or H2-blockers is also associated with an increased risk of *C. difficile* infection, though the exact mechanism for this is unknown

•   Clinical features:

-   Range from mild diarrheal illness to a severe, fulminant, and potentially fatal colitis

-   Criteria for severe *C. difficile* infection:

**•**   More frequent diarrhea and more severe abdominal pain

**•**   Very high leukocytosis, often ≥15K cells/μL

**•**   Hypotension and lactic acidosis due to hypovolemia and sepsis

**•**   AKI with Cr ≥1.5 mg/dL

**•**   Colonic ileus with little to no diarrhea, which is known as “toxic megacolon”

•   Diagnosis:

-   Perform *C. difficile* stool testing in patients with a diarrheal illness (e.g., ≥3 watery stools in a day) and no alternative reason to have loose stools (e.g., laxative use)

-   Consider CT abdomen/pelvis if concern for severe or fulminant disease

•   Treatment:

-   First-line treatment: Vancomycin 125 mg PO QID ×10 days or fidaxomicin 200 mg PO BID ×10 days. Add metronidazole 500 mg IV TID only if fulminant disease.

-   Recurrent disease: Defined by resolution of symptoms with therapy followed by return of symptoms within 2 months of treatment completion. Requires longer course of antibiotics.
