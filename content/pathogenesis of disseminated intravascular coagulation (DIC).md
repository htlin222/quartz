# pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)


* massive activation of coagulation that overwhelms control mechanisms

* Thrombosis in microvasculature → ischemia + microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

* Acute consumption of coagulation factors and platelets → bleeding

* Chronic DIC → able to compensate by ↑ factors and platelets → thrombosis
