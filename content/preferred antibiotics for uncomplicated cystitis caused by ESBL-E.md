# preferred antibiotics for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E

Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
have been shown to be safe and effective options for uncomplicated cystitis, including uncomplicated ESBL-E cystitis.
Although carbapenems and the [[fluoroquinolones]] **ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin** are effective agents against ESBL-E cystitis, their use for uncomplicated cystitis is discouraged when other safe and effective options are available.
