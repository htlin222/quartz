# drug induced hyperkalemia

- A wide range of drugs can cause hyperkalemia by a variety of mechanisms.
- Drugs can interfere with potassium homoeostasis either by promoting transcellular potassium shift or by impairing renal potassium excretion.
- Drugs may also increase potassium supply.
- The reduction in renal potassium excretion due to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system represents the most important mechanism by which drugs are known to cause hyperkalemia.
- Medications that alter transmembrane potassium movement
  - include amino acids,
  - beta-blockers,
  - calcium channel blockers,
  - suxamethonium, and
  - mannitol.
- Drugs that impair renal potassium excretion are mainly represented by
  - angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
  - angiotensin-II receptor blockers,
  - direct renin inhibitors,
  - nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
  - calcineurin inhibitors,
  - heparin and derivatives,
  - aldosterone antagonists,
  - potassium-sparing diuretics,
  - trimethoprim, and
  - pentamidine.
- Potassium-containing agents represent another group of medications causing hyperkalemia.
