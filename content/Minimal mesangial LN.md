# Minimal mesangial LN
(class I)Â 
-Â This class of lupus nephritis (LN) is â†’ rarely, if ever, diagnosed because these patients typically have a normal urinalysis, no or minimal proteinuria, and a normal serum creatinine. As a result, a biopsy is â†’ not usually performed. Patients with class I disease have only mesangial immune deposits that are identified by immunofluorescence alone or by both immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, but such patients do not have light microscopic abnormalities. Minimal mesangial LN (class I) represents the earliest and mildest form of glomerular involvement.
