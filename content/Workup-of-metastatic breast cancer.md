# Workup-of-metastatic breast cancer

- H&P: Including [[KPS]], dz-related sxs
- Labs:
  - CBC,
  - CMP,
  - consider baseline tumor markers (CEA, CA15-3, CA 27.29)
- Imaging:
  - PET-CT vs. CT C/A/P & Bone Scan (BS),
  - additional imaging for specific concerns
    - fracture â†’ X-ray,
    - brain met â†’ MRI,
    - equivocal staging â†’ PET
- Bx:
  - Strongly consider for the 1st met/recurrence to document met & ER/PR/HER2 status & obtain NGS.
  - Can have discordance in receptor status between 1Â° & met
    - due to sampling bias,
    - Î” in tumor biology,
    - proliferation of different clone,
    - lab error
