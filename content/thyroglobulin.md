# thyroglobulin

Thyroglobulin is a protein produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid gland[1][2]. It plays a crucial role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, specifically triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) [3][4]. Thyroglobulin is used by the thyroid gland to produce and store these hormones[4].

Here are some key points about thyroglobulin:

- Thyroglobulin is stored in the thyroid gland before being released into the bloodstream[5].
- Certain types of thyroid cancer, such as papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, can also produce thyroglobulin[5].
- Thyroglobulin levels can be measured through a blood test, which is typically ordered by a healthcare professional[5].
- The normal range for thyroglobulin levels in a healthy patient is 3 to 40 nanograms per milliliter[1].
- Monitoring thyroglobulin levels can be useful in detecting thyroid cancer recurrence or metastatic disease[1].
- It is important to check for the presence of thyroglobulin antibodies, as they can interfere with the measurement of thyroglobulin levels[1].
- Thyroglobulin is measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [1].

Overall, thyroglobulin is a protein that plays a crucial role in thyroid hormone synthesis and can be used as a marker for thyroid cancer recurrence and metastasis.
