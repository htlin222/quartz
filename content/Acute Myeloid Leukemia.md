### Acute Myeloid Leukemia

â€¢Â Â Â **Midostaurin plus chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia with a FLT3 mutation**. *N Engl J Med* 2017;377(5):454â€“464.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized phase 3 clinical trial to determine whether the addition of midostaurin, an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor that is active in patients with AML and a FLT3 mutation, to standard chemotherapy would prolong overall survival in this population. The addition of midostaurin increased overall survival and event free survival.

â€¢Â Â Â **Final results of a phase III randomized trial of CPX-351 versus 7**\+**3 in older patients with newly diagnosed high risk (secondary) AML**. *J Clin Onc* 2016;34(15 suppl):7000.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized phase 3 clinical trial that randomized patients 60â€“75 yr of age with untreated AML and a history of prior cytotoxic treatment, antecedent MDS or CMML, or AML with MDS-related cytogenic abnormalities to receive CPX-351 or 7\+3 (cytarabine and daunorubicin) induction therapy. CPX-351 (later named Vyxeos) significantly improved overall survival, event free survival, and response without an increase in 60-day mortality or adverse event frequency or severity. The authors concluded that CPX-351 should become standard of care for older patients with secondary AML.

â€¢Â Â Â **Venetoclax combined with decitabine or azacitidine in treatment-naive, elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia**. *Blood* 2019;133(1):7â€“17.

-Â Â Â Phase Ib dose escalation and expansion study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of venetoclax combined with decitabine or azacitadine in patients 65 yr or older. This combination showed tolerable safety and favorable overall response rate in elderly patients, changing the way we treat older adults with AML.
