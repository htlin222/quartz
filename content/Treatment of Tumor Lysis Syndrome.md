# Treatment of Tumor Lysis Syndrome

• Avoid IV contrast and NSAIDs; treat hyperK, hyperPO4, and only symptomatic hypoCa
• Allopurinol + aggressive IV hydration ± diuretics to ↑ UOP for goal 80–100 cc/h
• Rasburicase (0.1–0.2 mg/kg or 6 mg IV fixed dose) for ↑↑ uric acid esp. in aggressive malig (JCO 2003;21:4402; Acta Haem 2006;115:35). Avoid in G6PD def (hemolytic anemia). Consider G6PD testing in Jehovah’s Witnesses especially if Black (12% prevalence).
• Hemodialysis may be necessary; early renal consultation for renal insufficiency or ARF


*   consider intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, depending on clinical status and degree of metabolic derangement (**Note:** TLS implies a highly responsive tumor and initial response to therapy.)

*   lab tests every 4 to 6 hours and treatment of electrolyte abnormalities

*   cardiac monitoring

*   intravenous fluids (IVF)

*   rasburicase for significant hyperuricemia, particularly if renal dysfunction is a concern

*   dialysis as a last resort



The following flowchart is helpful for the initial assessment and management of TLS:
