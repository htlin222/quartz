# epitope_definition

- Definition
  - An epitope, also known as antigenic determinant, is recognized by antibodies, B cells, or T cells.
- Types
  - Epitopes are categorized into conformational epitopes and linear epitopes based on their structure and interaction with the paratope.
- [[conformational_vs._linear_epitopes.md|Conformational vs. Linear Epitopes]]
  - Conformational epitopes are determined by 3-D conformations of discontiguous amino acid residues, whereas linear epitopes by contiguous residues.
- Prevalence
  - 90% of epitopes are conformational.
- T cell epitopes
  - T cell epitopes are peptides presented on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell, bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.
- MHC Class Peptides
  - MHC class I molecules typically present peptides of 8-11 amino acids, and MHC class II molecules present longer peptides of 13-17 amino acids.
