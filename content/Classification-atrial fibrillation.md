## Paroxysmal

*   Terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset.
*   Episodes may recur with variable frequency.
*   Paroxysmal (terminates spontaneously or within 7 d) vs. persistent (>7 d) vs. long-standing persistent (>1 y) vs. permanent (no plan for SR)

## Persistent

*   Continuous sustained >7 days

## Long-standing persistent

*   Continuous >12 mo in duration.

## Permanent

*   Used when the patient and clinician make a joint decision to stop further attempts to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm.
*   Acceptance represents a therapeutic attitude on the part of the patient and clinician rather than an inherent pathophysiological attribute.
*   May change as symptoms, efficacy of therapeutic interventions, and patient and clinician preferences evolve.

## Nonvalvular

*   In the absence of **rheumatic mitral** stenosis, a mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valve, or mitral valve repair.
*   Nonvalvular vs. valvular (mechanical heart valve or moderate-severe MS)

## With Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR)

*   With persistent [[ventricular heart rate >100 beats]] per minute
