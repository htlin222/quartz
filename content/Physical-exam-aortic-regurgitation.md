# Physical-exam-aortic-regurgitation

* Early diastolic decrescendo murmur at LSB (RSB if dilated Ao root); ↑ w/ sitting forward, expir, handgrip; severity of AR ∝ duration of murmur (except in acute and severe late); Austin Flint murmur: mid-to-late diastolic rumble at apex (AR jet interfering w/ mitral inflow)
* Wide pulse pressure due to ↑ stroke volume, hyper-dynamic pulse; pulse pressure narrows in late AR with ↓ LV fxn; bisferiens (twice-beating) arterial pulse
* PMI diffuse and laterally displaced; soft S1 (early closure of MV); ± S3 (≠ ↓ EF but rather just volume overload in AR)
