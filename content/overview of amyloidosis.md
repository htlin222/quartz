# overview of amyloidosis

- **Types of Amyloidosis:** Extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils made up of low molecular weight subunits from various proteins.
- **Subunit Proteins:** Derived from soluble precursors undergoing conformational changes leading to beta-pleated sheet configuration.
- **38 Protein Precursors:** Known for forming amyloid fibrils.
- **Major Forms:**
  - **AL Amyloidosis:** Result of protein deposition from immunoglobulin light chain fragments.
  - **Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTR):** Caused by hereditary mutations or aging-related factors.
  - **AA Amyloidosis:** Common in resource-limited regions, linked to chronic inflammation.
  - **Additional Forms:** Dialysis-related, hereditary, age-related, organ-specific amyloidosis, etc.
- **Clinical Manifestations:** Vary based on amyloid type and distribution.
- **Diagnosis:** Tissue biopsy essential for confirmation. Different biopsy sites based on organ involvement.
- **Monoclonal Protein Testing:** Biopsy-proven amyloidosis with plasma cell disorder may not need further testing. Monoclonal protein presence tested via electrophoresis and immunofixation.
- **Treatment:** Varies depending on fibril production cause, targeting underlying disorders.
- **AL Amyloidosis:** Targets plasma cell dyscrasia.
- **AA Amyloidosis:** Focuses on underlying infections or inflammatory issues.
- **Dialysis-Related Amyloidosis:** Adjusts dialysis mode or considers transplantation.
- **Hereditary Amyloidoses:** Liver transplantation may be effective.
- **Therapies:** Aim to decrease TTR production and clear amyloid deposits.
