### Neuromuscular Disorders

##### Motor Neuron Diseases

##### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons leading to a combination of hyperreflexia/spasticity and atrophy/fasciculations

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: EMG; rule out mimics with MRI brain/C-spine, B12/MMA, TSH, PTH, Lyme ab, heavy metals

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Riluzole (survival benefit of 2â€“3 months)

##### Peripheral Neuropathies

Exam is notable for LMN signs (hypo- or areflexia, decreased tone, atrophy, fasciculations); may be symmetric or asymmetric. Axonal neuropathy is typically length-dependent, demyelinating neuropathy is patchy.

##### Mononeuropathy

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Usually due to nerve compression (e.g., carpal tunnel, cubital fossa). Progressive sequential mononeuropathy suggests mononeuritis multiplex and requires an urgent work-up

##### Polyneuropathy

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Approximately 1/3 due to complications of diabetes, 1/3 due to complications of chronic alcohol use, and 1/3 due to other causes including:

-Â Â Â Immune mediated (Guillain-BarrÃ©, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy \[CIDP\])

-Â Â Â Metabolic (thyroid disease, uremia, vitamin B12 deficiency, paraproteinemia)

-Â Â Â Rheumatologic (SLE, vasculitis)

-Â Â Â Malignancy/monoclonal gammopathy (paraneoplastic, leukemia, MGUS, amyloid)

-Â Â Â Infection (HIV, syphilis, lyme, leprosy)

-Â Â Â Toxin/medications (heavy metals, amiodarone, chemotherapy)

-Â Â Â Inherited (Charcot-Marie Tooth disease)
