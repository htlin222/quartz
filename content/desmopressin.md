- Desmopressin can cause **hyponatremia**, which can be life-threatening.
- Desmopressin is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia.
- Risk factors include excessive fluid intake, illnesses causing fluid/electrolyte imbalances, and use of certain medications.
- Serum sodium concentrations should be normal before starting or resuming desmopressin.
- Serum sodium should be measured within 7 days and ~1 month after starting therapy and periodically during treatment.
- Monitor serum sodium more frequently in patients â‰¥65 years and at increased risk of hyponatremia.
- If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued.
