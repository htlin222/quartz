### Echocardiography

##### Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Most common type of echocardiogram. The ultrasound transducer is placed on the chest or abdomen of the patient to get various views of the heart to provide a noninvasive assessment of cardiac function, including an assessment of the heart valves and degree of cardiac contraction.

##### Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Echocardiogram performed using a transducer that is passed into the patientâ€™s esophagus, thus allowing better visualization of cardiac structures compared to a TTE.

â€¢Â Â Â Indications: Evaluating for a cardiac source of embolism, endocarditis, prosthetic heart valve dysfunction, native valvular disease, and aortic dissection or aneurysm

##### Point-of-care (PoC) echocardiography

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: A bedside echocardiogram that can be done to assess for gross abnormalities. Bedside assessment is highly dependent upon user skill, so it is important to practice with a skilled point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) provider. See Figure 1.12.



**FIGURE 1.12: Views in Cardiac Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS)**. This figure depicts four common views utilized in cardiac POCUS. For each view, the figure at left shows the position of the transducer on the patientâ€™s chest/abdomen. The figure at right shows a depiction of the cardiac structures visible using that view. Of note, POCUS is highly user-dependent so clinical findings should be confirmed with a formal TTE if indicated. Abbreviations: Right atrium (RA), Right ventricle (RV), Left atrium (LA), Left ventricle (LV), Inferior vena cava (IVC).

â€¢Â Â Â Indications: A bedside echocardiogram can be performed to identify different causes of acute cardiac failure or hemodynamic instability. The size and ability to compress the inferior vena cava (IVC) can be used to estimate the right atrial (RA) pressure:

-Â Â Â IVC >2.1 cm and <50% collapsible: Right atrial pressure approximately 15 mmHg

-Â Â Â IVC <2.1 cm and <50% collapsible: Right atrial pressure approximately 8 mmHg

-Â Â Â IVC >2.1 cm and >50% collapsible: Right atrial pressure approximately 8 mmHg

-Â Â Â IVC <2.1 cm and >50% collapsible: Right atrial pressure approximately 3 mmHg
