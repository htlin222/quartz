# Real-World Data_ P-REALITY X Study

Real-world data in diverse patient populations can complement clinical trial data in informing routine clinical practice.
In the real-world P-REALITY X study, patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer treated with palbociclib plus an aromatase inhibitor lived longer than those treated with only an aromatase inhibitor.
This podcast provides a comprehensive overview of the P-REALITY X study, including its design, key results, and clinical implications, and how this information can be integrated into conversations with patients.
