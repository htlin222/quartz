# Treatment: Asymptomatic Patients of mantle cell lymphoma
- Observation appears to be safe in asx pts w/ low tumor burden (JCO 2009;27:1209)
- Pattern of distribution (either spleen/leukemic/BM or GI only), low proliferative index by **Ki-67 staining** (<10%), & absence of **SOX11** have been suggested as markers of an indolent course
