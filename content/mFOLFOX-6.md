The mFOLFOX6 regimen is a chemotherapy treatment used primarily for colorectal cancer. It combines several drugs to help fight cancer cells. The "m" stands for modified, indicating a specific variation of the FOLFOX regimen. The components of mFOLFOX6 include:

1. **Oxaliplatin**
2. **Leucovorin** (Folinic acid)
3. **Fluorouracil** (5-FU)

The typical dose for the mFOLFOX6 regimen is as follows:

- **Oxaliplatin**: 85 mg/mÂ² IV over 2 hours, Day 1
- **Leucovorin**: 400 mg/mÂ² IV over 2 hours, Day 1 (given concurrently with oxaliplatin)
- **Fluorouracil**: 400 mg/mÂ² IV bolus on Day 1, followed by 2400 to 3000 mg/mÂ² IV over 46 hours continuous infusion

This regimen is usually repeated every 2 weeks, constituting one cycle of chemotherapy. However, the exact dosage and duration might vary based on the patient's health status, response to the treatment, and any side effects experienced. It's crucial for treatment to be supervised by a healthcare professional who can adjust the regimen as necessary for the patient's safety and well-being.
