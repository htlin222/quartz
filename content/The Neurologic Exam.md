### The Neurologic Exam

##### Mental status

•   Orientation: Person, place, time, situation

•   Language: Fluency, repetition, naming (high and low frequency items), comprehension (axial \[“close eyes, stick out tongue”\] and appendicular \[“show two fingers, give thumbs up”\] commands, complex commands \[“take your right thumb, touch your left ear, and stick out your tongue”\])

•   Attention: Ask patient to spell “WORLD” forward, then backward. Alternatively: Recite months of the year or days of the week backward.

•   Memory: Working (digit span forward (normal >5–7 digits), backward) and delayed (remember three words ×5 minutes)

##### Cranial nerves

•   I – Olfactory nerve: Not frequently tested

•   II – Optic nerve/III parasympathetic fibers: Visual fields/pupillary constriction (afferent – optic nerve, efferent parasympathetic fibers)

•   III, IV, VI – Oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves: Extraocular muscle movements

•   V – Trigeminal nerves: Facial sensation, motor for muscles of mastication

•   VII – Facial nerve: Facial movement, eyelid closure, lacrimation and salivation, taste in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue

•   VIII – Vestibulocochlear nerve: Hearing from the cochlear nerve, balance from the vestibular nerve

•   IX, X – Glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve: Palate elevation, gag, cough

##### Motor

•   Bulk and tone: Increased = spasticity, rigidity, or paratonia; decreased = flaccidity

•   Screening motor exam: Pronator drift (sign of upper motor neuron weakness; evaluate for finger flexion and/or pronation with arms outstretched and eyes closed), finger taps and toe taps (evaluate for large, symmetric, rapid movements)

•   Confrontational strength testing:

-   Power: Score motor strength in each muscle group from 0 to 5:

**•**   0: No contraction

**•**   1: Trace movement

**•**   2: Full range of motion when gravity is eliminated

**•**   3: Full range of motion against gravity

**•**   4: Movement against gravity with resistance, but still less than full strength

**•**   5: Full/normal strength

-   Preferential muscle groups to test:

**•**   Upper extremity: Shoulder abduction (deltoids), flexion and extension at elbow (biceps, triceps, resp), wrist extension, finger extension and abduction

**•**   Lower extremity: Hip flexion (ilioposas), knee flexion and extension (hamstrings, quads), ankle dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior)

##### Sensory

•   Screening exam: Assess ability to sense light touch

•   Small fiber: Pain (safety pin) and temperature (alcohol swab, cold tuning fork)

•   Large fiber: Vibration (tuning fork) and proprioception (joint position sense)

##### Reflexes

•   Upper extremity reflexes: Biceps (C5–6), triceps (C7–8)

•   Lower extremity reflexes: Patellae (L3–4), Achilles tendon (S1–S2)

•   Plantar response: Apply noxious stimulus starting at the lateral aspect of the sole of the foot, moving medially across the ball of the foot. Normal response is flexor (toes down); abnormal response is extensor (large toe goes up and remaining toes fan out = Babinski sign)

##### Coordination

•   Appendicular (limb) ataxia: Finger-nose-finger, heel-knee-shin

•   Truncal ataxia: Sitting upright unsupported, gait ataxia

##### Gait

•   Description of gait: Stance (normal, wide, or narrow-based), stride length, foot clearance (shuffling; foot drop → steppage gait), arm swing (decreased in parkinsonism)

•   Romberg test: Balance requires visual, vestibular (inner ear), and proprioceptive (positional sense) systems. Romberg testing eliminates vision and tests the remaining two; this is NOT a test of cerebellar function\!
