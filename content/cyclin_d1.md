# cyclin_d1

G1–S transition 過程中的重要蛋白，由 Growth Factor 所刺激

[CCND1 amplification and cyclin D1 immunohistochemical expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23494454/)

- Cyclin D1
  - Essential regulator of the G1–S transition in response to growth factor stimulation in somatic cells
  - ES cells express a low cyclin D1 level
  - Regulation of cyclin D1 expression differs between ES cells and other cells
    - Ras/ERK pathway does not contribute to regulation of cyclin D1 expression in ES cells
    - PI3K signaling critically regulates steady-state level of cyclin D1 protein in ES cells
    - PI3K activity seems to be uncoupled from persistent mitogenic stimulation in ES cells
  - Expression of cyclin D1 is disconnected from mitogenic signals transduced by tyrosine kinase receptors in ES cells
  - Constitutive, low expression of cyclin D1 could contribute to constitutive phosphorylation of RB
  - Functional significance of cyclin D-CDK4 complexes in ES cells may be to sequester p27kip1 and prevent inhibitor from acting on cyclin E-CDK2 kinase.
