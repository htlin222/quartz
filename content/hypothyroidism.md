# hypothyroidism

## Etiologies

- Primary (**>90%** of cases of hypothyroidism; ↓ free T4, ↑ TSH)
  Goitrous: [[Hashimoto’s thyroiditis]] (after hyperthyroid phase of thyroiditis), iodine deficiency, lithium, amiodarone
  Nongoitrous: surgical destruction, s/p radioactive iodine or XRT, amiodarone
- Secondary (central): ↓ free T4; TSH low, inappropriately nl, or slightly high (although functionally inactive due to abnormal glycosylation); due to hypothalamic or pituitary failure

## Hashimoto’s thyroiditis

## Clinical manifestations (Annals 2020;173:ITC1)

- Early: weakness, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, depression, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, menorrhagia, dry skin, coarse brittle hair, brittle nails, carpal tunnel syndrome, delayed DTRs (“hung up” reflexes), diastolic HTN, hyperlipidemia
- Late: slow speech; hoarseness; loss of outer third of eyebrows; myxedema (nonpitting skin thickening due to ↑ glycosaminoglycans); periorbital puffiness; bradycardia; pleural, pericardial, & peritoneal effusions; atherosclerosis
- Myxedema crisis: vide infra

## Diagnostic studies (Lancet 2017;390:1550)

- ↓ free T4; ↑ TSH in 1º hypothyroidism; ⊕ antithyroid Ab (TPO) in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
- May see hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, anemia, ↑ LDL, ↓ HDL and ↑ CK
- Screening recommended for pregnant women
