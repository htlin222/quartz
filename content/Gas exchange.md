### Gas exchange

•   Oxygen:

-   Oxygen is transported in two forms: 1) Dissolved in blood; 2) Bound to Hgb (most important/majority)

**•**   Hemoglobin: 2α2β subunits; heme moiety with iron-containing porphyrin

**•**   O2 capacity refers to the maximum amount of O2 that can be bound to Hgb

-   Upper limit of how much O2 can be carried by the blood

-   Must be measured at 100% saturation

**•**   O2 content refers to the total O2 carried in blood = Hgb-bound O2 \+ dissolved O2 = (1.34 × \[Hgb\] × % Sat) \+ (0.0031 \+ PaO2)

-   Oxygen–Hgb dissociation curve is SIGMOIDAL (Figure 2.6)



**FIGURE 2.6: Oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve.** “Right shifts” in the curve allow oxygen to be released from hemoglobin more easily, whereas “left shifts” cause oxygen to bind hemoglobin more tightly. O2 = oxygen; P50 = oxygen tension at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated; PCO2 = partial pressure of carbon dioxide; H\+ = hydrogen ions; 2,3-DPG = 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid

**•**   **Shift L**: Increased O2 affinity = ↓ PCO2, ↓ 2,3 DPG, ↓Exercise, ↓Temperature, ↓H\+, Fetal Hb, CO

**•**   **Shift R**: Lower O2 affinity = ↑ P**C**O2, **A**ltitude, ↑ 2,3 **D**PG, **E**xercise, ↑ **T**emperature, (**CADET**), ↑H\+

•   Carbon dioxide:

-   Carbon dioxide transport: 1) HCO3 formed by carbonic anhydrase (~90% of CO2), 2) Dissolved CO2, 3) Carbaminohemoglobin (i.e., Hgb-CO2)

-   Hgb–CO2 dissociation curve is LINEAR

**•**   In lungs, Hgb is oxygenated → Hgb–CO2 dissociation curve shifts right \+ down → CO2 unloads (Haldane effect)

•   Variations/disruptions in Hgb function:

-   **Methemoglobinemia (Met-Hgb):** Involves iron in Hgb converting from ferrous \[Fe2\+\] to ferric \[Fe3\+\] form, making it unable to bind oxygen. Medication culprits include dapsone, nitrates. Tx: Methylene blue.

-   **Carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hgb):** Product of reaction between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin; CO releases more slowly than CO2 from Hgb. Symptoms: Tiredness, dizziness, unconsciousness, death. Tx: Nonrebreather, hyperbaric chamber. Involve toxicology.
