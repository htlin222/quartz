### Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and Post-ACS Care

â€¢Â Â Â **CAPRICORN.** *The Lancet* 2001;357(9266):1385â€“1390.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 1959 patients who had had a hemodynamically stable MI with reduced LVEF of â‰¤40% who were already on an ACE inhibitor (unless proven intolerance) to receive carvedilol or placebo. Treatment with carvedilol was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (12% vs. 15% in placebo group).

â€¢Â Â Â **MIRACL.** *JAMA* 2001;285(13):1711â€“1718.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 3086 patients who were hospitalized for unstable angina/NSTEMI to receive either atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo daily. The early initiation of atorvastatin reduced the combined endpoint of death, nonfatal MI, cardiac arrest, and ACS requiring hospitalization at 16 weeks.

â€¢Â Â Â **IMPROVE-IT.** *N Engl J Med* 2015;375(25):2387â€“2397.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 18,144 patients with recent ACS to simvastatin 40 mg daily plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily vs. simvastatin 40 mg alone. The combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin reduced CV events (CV mortality, major CV event, or nonfatal stroke) when compared to statin therapy alone.
