### Depressed Mood/Suicidal Ideation

•   Definitions:

-   **Suicidal ideation** **(SI)**

**•**   **Active SI:** Thoughts about acting to kill oneself with intent and/or plan (e.g., considering whether to shoot oneself with an owned gun, etc.)

**•**   **Passive SI:** Thoughts about dying without intent and/or plan; an expression of despair/not wanting to be in a current mood, state, or situation (e.g., thoughts of “being better off dead,” thoughts of being hit by a car, etc.)

**•**   **Conditional SI:** Thoughts of suicide that are dependent on specific conditions, such as satisfying a need, obtaining secondary gain, or remaining in the sick role (e.g., “If you don’t prescribe pain medications, I’m going to kill myself”)

-   **Suicide attempt:** Self-injury made in an attempt to kill oneself that does not result in fatality

-   **Suicidal gesture:** Self-injury made in an attempt to lead others to think that one wants to kill oneself even though there is no intention of dying; clinical feature of borderline personality disorder (e.g., holding a knife to one’s neck, putting a rope around one’s neck)

•   Risk factors for suicide: Prior attempts, psychiatric disease (>90% of patient who attempt), hopelessness, married, member of sexual minority, certain occupations, veterans, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, access to firearms

•   Differential diagnosis for depressed mood:

-   Psychiatric disease:

**•**   Major depressive disorder

**•**   Bipolar disorder

**•**   Anxiety disorders

**•**   Personality disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder)

**•**   Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

**•**   Psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia)

**•**   Substance use disorders

-   Other causes:

**•**   Depression due to another medical condition

-   Cardiac disease

-   Malignancy (especially oropharyngeal and pancreatic)

-   Neurologic disease (including stroke, movement disorders)

-   Diabetes

-   Hypothyroidism

-   Chronic infection (including HIV, HCV)

**•**   Depression due to medication effect

**•**   Traumatic brain injury

**•**   Chronic pain

**•**   Malingering

•   Approach:

-   Safety assessment:

**•**   Assess the suicidal ideation (i.e., passive vs. active; assess for plan, intent, means, lethality of means, rehearsal \[i.e., elements of the plan being practiced, making preparations for one’s death\])

**•**   Assess protective factors (e.g., children or pets who rely on the person, loved ones who would be affected by their death, willingness to engage in safety planning/contingency planning for worsening symptoms, having hopes for the future \[“future-oriented”\], etc.)

**•**   Assess for risk factors (see list of risk factors above), especially for prior suicide attempts

-   Assess for triggers/stressors

•   Work-up: CBC, BMP, LFTs, TSH (assess baseline organ function in anticipation of pharmacotherapy; rule out fatigue due to medical comorbidities, e.g., anemia or hypothyroidism mimicking depression). Consider additional testing based on exam/review of symptoms.

**•**   Management:

-   Medical stabilization (if patient has attempted suicide and attempt was non-fatal) with involvement of psychiatry to make appropriate holding plan

-   Determine appropriate level of care (e.g., inpatient, day program, intensive outpatient therapy, outpatient): Inpatient hospitalization always indicated for recent attempt or high imminent risk (e.g., patients with plan/intent, poor social support, inability to discuss safety planning)

-   Create a safety plan

**•**   Know warning signs and precipitants

**•**   Secure/remove lethal agents

**•**   Utilize individual coping strategies, such as reflecting on reasons to live, distraction activities, relaxation, and exercise

**•**   Utilize interpersonal coping, such as friends or family who lift mood

**•**   Create a list of professionals who can help and how to contact them

-   Initiate pharmacotherapy: See Table 13.3
