# Hereditary RCC and germline testing-of-renal-cell-carcinoma

- There are several RCC-assoc genetic CA syn incl.
  - [[vhl.md|VHL]]
  - [[hlrcc.md|HLRCC]] (FH gene),
  - [[bap1 tumor predisposition syn.md|BAP1 tumor predisposition syn]]
  - Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© (FLCN gene)
  - among others

## Consider any of the following for Hereditary RCC gene panel testing & CA Genetics referral

#### FHx

- Close relative w/ known pathogenic variant
- â‰¥1 1st-or 2nd-degree relative w/ RCC

#### Clinical Characteristics

- Dxâ€™d at age â‰¤46 y
- Bilateral or multifocal tumors
- Angiomyolipomas of kidney + 1 other TSC-assoc criterion
  - tuberous sclerosis

#### Histopathologic Characteristics

- Multifocal papillary histology
- Histologic features a/w HLRCC or FH deficiency found
- BHD syn-related histology (multiple chromophobe, oncocytoma, oncocytic hybrid)
- Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficient histology
