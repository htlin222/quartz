### Management of Complications Associated with Advanced CKD/ESRD

##### Blood pressure/volume

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology of hypertension in CKD: Complex and multifactorial, attributed to reduced nephron mass, increased Na\+ retention, extracellular volume expansion, activation of hormones (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system, and endothelial dysfunction

â€¢Â Â Â Goal blood pressure: Generally <130/80 mmHg. This may be more liberal when accounting for certain factors, such as the degree of kidney disease, dialysis tolerance, polypharmacy, adverse effects of medication, and history of transplant.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Sodium restriction is a key element of BP control. Fluid restriction becomes more important when GFR is severely reduced.

-Â Â Â Patients should monitor PO intake and weight. Dry weight is estimated by exam and maintained through diuresis or ultrafiltration during dialysis.

-Â Â Â Pharmacotherapy:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Diuretics

-Â Â Â If a patient is still urinating, diuretics can assist with volume management

-Â Â Â Diuretics depend on reaching active concentrations in the tubule lumen; higher doses are required with worsening renal function as urea competitively binds to the Organic Anion Transporter 1 (OAT1) which transports the diuretics into the tubular lumen

-Â Â Â Most diuretics cause net fluid loss by preventing tubular sodium reabsorption

-Â Â Â Loop diuretics will often be necessary if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Efficacy in reduced eGFR: bumetanide > furosemide > metolazone > chlorthalidone > hydrochlorothiazide).

**â€¢**Â Â Â ACE inhibitors/ARBs

-Â Â Â First-line antihypertensive in CKD, especially with proteinuria and relatively preserved native kidney function

-Â Â Â Can cause hyperkalemia

-Â Â Â Increase in creatinine after starting agents is not necessarily indicative of kidney injury; generally should not be discontinued unless eGFR decreases by >30%

-Â Â Â Combination ACE/ARB associated with increased renal decline and generally contraindicated (**ONTARGET study *Lancet 2008***)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Calcium channel blocker (CCB)

-Â Â Â Do not need dose modification for renal clearance

-Â Â Â Relatively few adverse effects, can cause lower extremity edema

-Â Â Â Preferred class in CKD after ACE/ARB and diuretics; can reduce proteinuria

**â€¢**Â Â Â Beta-blockers

-Â Â Â Typically used if secondary prevention of cardiac events is warranted

-Â Â Â Agents with combination alpha/beta antagonism are preferred to avoid metabolic effects of beta blockers, e.g., carvedilol and labetalol

-Â Â Â Nonrenal clearance is preferred, e.g., carvedilol

**â€¢**Â Â Â Clonidine

-Â Â Â No renal dose adjustment

-Â Â Â Often used for hypertension on days between dialysis sessions

-Â Â Â Associated with rebound hypertension when discontinued or doses missed

##### Anemia

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Results from decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production, EPO resistance, and decreased RBC lifespan

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Goal Hgb 10â€“11.5 g/dL

-Â Â Â Check iron studies in CKD patients with anemia

-Â Â Â Guidelines recommend for transferrin saturation >30%, ferritin >500 ng/mL, though practice patterns vary widely and less stringent targets may be used (e.g., transferrin saturation >20% and ferritin >100 ng/mL)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Ferritin can be increased with inflammatory states too

**â€¢**Â Â Â Rule out GI bleeding if you detect iron deficiency

-Â Â Â Iron supplementation

**â€¢**Â Â Â IV iron is preferred in patients on hemodialysis. PO supplementation causes constipation, adds to pill burden, and is minimally absorbed compared to IV formulations.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Iron sucrose (Venofer) and ferric gluconate (Ferrlecit) are the most commonly used formulations

**â€¢**Â Â Â IV iron can cause anaphylaxis when first given; provide a test dose and administer slowly for patients who are IV iron naive

-Â Â Â Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Give if patient is iron replete but remains below Hgb goal

**â€¢**Â Â Â Three formulations:

-Â Â Â Epoetin alfa (Epogen). 3Ã— per week during HD or weekly in non-HD CKD.

-Â Â Â Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp). Weekly during HD or monthly in non-HD CKD.

-Â Â Â Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera). Every 2 weeks.

-Â Â Â RBC Transfusion

**â€¢**Â Â Â Uses:

-Â Â Â Consider pRBC transfusion if ESAs are contraindicated or unsuccessful

-Â Â Â Administer pRBCs if anemia is symptomatic or severe (Hgb <7 g/dL)

##### Bone mineral metabolism

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Mineral bone disorder is due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which has two main contributing factors:

-Â Â Â Decreased 1-alpha-hydroxylase (made by the kidney) â†’ decreased activation of 25-hydroxy vitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D â†’ decreased Ca2\+ absorption â†’ decreased serum Ca2\+ level â†’ increased PTH

-Â Â Â Poor phosphate excretion â†’ elevated phosphate â†’ increased PTH and decreased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D

â€¢Â Â Â Manifestations of CKD mineral bone disorder:

-Â Â Â Mineral and hormone abnormalities

**â€¢**Â Â Â Increased phosphate

**â€¢**Â Â Â Increased PTH

**â€¢**Â Â Â Decreased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D

-Â Â Â Structural bone abnormalities

**â€¢**Â Â Â Renal osteodystrophy: Range of abnormal bone pathology, bone turnover, and mineralization; includes osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease, and osteitis fibrosa cystica

**â€¢**Â Â Â Increased alkaline phosphatase: Reflects osteoblast activity and bone turnover

**â€¢**Â Â Â Increased FGF23: Secreted by osteocytes and involved in phosphate regulation

-Â Â Â Calcification of blood vessels and soft tissue

â€¢Â Â Â Management of CKD mineral bone disorder:

-Â Â Â Phosphate

**â€¢**Â Â Â Phosphate level should ideally be within the normal range, though levels <5.5 mg/dL are often tolerated by providers

**â€¢**Â Â Â Phosphate binders are used to lower phosphate by preventing absorption of dietary phosphate

**â€¢**Â Â Â Calcium-based phosphate binders (data below from **ST. PETER et al. *AJKD* 2018**)

-Â Â Â Calcium acetate (Phoslo) 667 mg/tablet; 34% of ESRD patients on this medication, cheap ($678/user-yr), strongest binder

-Â Â Â Calcium carbonate (Tums), cheap

**â€¢**Â Â Â Non-calcium-based phosphate binders

-Â Â Â Sevelamer (Renvela) 800 mg/tablet; preferred by some due to absence of calcium, 54% of ESRD patients on this medication, expensive ($2000â€“$4000/user-yr).

-Â Â Â Lanthanum carbonate (Carbrenol); 5% ESRD patients on this medication, expensive ($5000/user-yr).

-Â Â Â Iron-based phosphate binders: Ferric citrate and sucroferric oxyhydroxide. May be preferred if iron supplementation is needed.

-Â Â Â Calcium

**â€¢**Â Â Â Keep corrected Ca2\+ within normal range

**â€¢**Â Â Â Dialysate can be adjusted to address low or high Ca2\+ levels

**â€¢**Â Â Â Consider measuring ionized calcium (iCa) in patients with significant hypoalbuminemia, acidemia, or hyperphosphatemia

-Â Â Â Vitamin D

**â€¢**Â Â Â All CKD patients should be screened and treated for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (check 25-hydroxy vitamin D level). 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D is not routinely measured in practice.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treat with cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol unless hypercalcemia or significant hyperphosphatemia is present

-Â Â Â PTH

**â€¢**Â Â Â Guidelines recommend that PTH remain within 2â€“9Ã— the upper limit of normal (~150â€“600 pg/mL) in HD patients

**â€¢**Â Â Â Practice varies and treatment in non-HD patients is controversial

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treatment: Active vitamin D analogs or calcimimetics are prescribed for severely elevated or rising PTH with replete 25-hydroxy vitamin D

-Â Â Â Active vitamin D: Analogs of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D

â€¢Â Â Â Calcitriol (Rocaltrol). PO. Usually used for non-HD patients.

â€¢Â Â Â Paricalcitol (Zemplar). Administered IV. Usually given with HD.

â€¢Â Â Â Doxicalciferol (Hectorol). Administered IV. Usually given with HD.

-Â Â Â Calcimimetics: Competitive binder of Ca2\+ sensing receptor, which regulates PTH release. Usually used when active vitamin D analogues are inadequate or contraindicated due to hypercalcemia. More expensive than active vitamin D analogues. Side effects: Can cause hypocalcemia, nausea and vomiting.

â€¢Â Â Â Cinacalcet (Sensipar) â€“ PO; in use since 2004

â€¢Â Â Â Etelcalcetide (Parsabiv) â€“ IV; given with HD

-Â Â Â Parathyroidectomy: Reserved for severe and refractory hyperparathyroidism in CKD
