### Metabolic Acidosis

↓**pH, ↓ HCO3–, (Immediate respiratory compensation = Hyperventilation ↓PaCO2)**

•   Clinical features: Hyperventilation (Kussmaul’s respirations if pH <7.2); decreased cardiac output and tissue perfusion due to decreased response to catecholamines

•   Calculate anion gap (AG): **Anion Gap** = **Na**\+ **– (Cl**– \+ **HCO**3–)

-   **Increased anion gap:** There are mnemonics like “MUDPILES” or “GOLD MARK,” but simpler to consider four buckets:

**•**   Ketoacidosis (DKA, starvation, alcohol use)

-   Pearl: SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with *euglycemic* ketoacidosis (glucose <200 mg/dL). A normal serum glucose does not rule out ketoacidosis if these medications are being taken\!

**•**   Lactic acidosis (hypoperfusion, bowel ischemia, seizures)

-   L-lactic acidosis = Hypoperfusion and type B causes

-   D-lactic acidosis = Bacterial overgrowth, DKA or propylene glycol infusion. Of note, D lactic acidosis is NOT measured by laboratory lactate measurement.

**•**   Renal failure (decreased excretion of NH4\+ and other acids)

**•**   Intoxication (aspirin, methanol, ethylene glycol)

-   Check osmolar gap (Measured serum osms – calculated serum osms)

-   Calculated serum osms = 2(Na\+) \+ Gluc/18 \+ BUN / 2.8 \+ EtOH / 4.6

-   Pearl: Measure serum ethanol and incorporate into the serum Osm calculation to avoid a false-positive osmolar gap if it is present.

-   **Normal anion gap:** Check urine anion gap = Urine (Na\+ \+ K\+ – Cl-)

**•**   Renal losses (positive urine anion gap): Proximal/distal tubular acidosis, acetazolamide, spironolactone

**•**   GI or other extra-renal losses (negative urine anion gap): Saline administration, diarrhea, pancreatic or small bowel fistulas or drains

**•**   Hypoaldosteronism

•   Appropriate respiratory compensation? **Winter’s formula: PaCO**2 = **1.5(HCO**3–**) \+ 8** ± **2**

-   If PaCO2 falls within the excepted range, then the patient just has a metabolic acidosis

-   If the actual (i.e., measured) PaCO2 is higher than the calculated PaCO2 using Winter’s formula, then the patient has a metabolic acidosis \+ respiratory acidosis

-   If the actual (i.e., measured) PaCO2 is lower than the calculated PaCO2 using Winter’s formula, then the patient has a metabolic acidosis \+ respiratory alkalosis

•   Treatment: Treat the underlying cause; PO alkali supplementation (sodium bicarb, sodium citrate, potassium citrate) for chronic causes; IV sodium bicarb if pH <7.1
