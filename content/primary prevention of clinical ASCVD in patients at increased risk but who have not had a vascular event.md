# primary prevention of clinical ASCVD in patients at increased risk but who have not had a vascular event

## LDL-C >190 mg/dL
* No risk assessment, commence high- or maximally tolerated intensity statin
* Rule out secondary causes of hyperlipidemia

## Diabetes mellitus age 40â€“75 LDL-C <190 mg/dL
* Commence moderate-intensity statin with consideration for high-intensity statin based on ASCVD risk assessment

## No diabetes mellitus age 40â€“75 LDL-C <190 mg/dL

Calculate 10-year ASCVD risk percent to begin discussion:
1. <5% (low risk): diet and lifestyle factors
2. 5%â€“7.5% (borderline risk): if risk enhancers present consider moderate-intensity statin
3. 7.5%â€“20% (intermediate risk): if risk enhancers present initiate moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30%â€“49%
4. >20% (high risk): initiate statin to achieve LDL-C reduction of at least 50%
