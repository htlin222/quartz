-Â Â Â Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial that randomized patients at high risk for CVD but who did not have a history of diabetes or stroke to an intensive (<120 mmHg) vs. standard (<140 mmHg) SBP target. Intensive BP control (target SBP <120 mmHg) improved CV outcomes and overall survival compared to the standard SBP goal <140 mmHg, with modest increase in the risk of some serious adverse events. Similar benefits were demonstrated in a CKD subgroup analysis (*JASN* 2017:28(9):2561â€“2563).
