  - pulmonary effusion
  - ± pericardial and peritoneal effusions secondary to granuloma breakdown and local inflammation;
  - can occur in primary or reactivation
- Reactivation TB pulmonary disease:
  - upper lobe infiltrate
  - ± volume loss
  - ± cavitation
- Milliary TB:
  - diffuse millet seed-sized lesions,
  - more common in immunosupp.
- [[Extrapulmonary TB]]:
- TB and HIV:

  - reactivation (8–10%/yr without ART, higher w/ ↓ CD4),
