# Treatment-polyuria

- 1° polydipsia:
  - treat psychiatric illness,
  - check meds,
  - restrict access to free H2O
- Osmotic diuresis:
  - address underlying cause,
  - replace free H2O deficit
  - (see “[[hypernatremia]]” for formula to calculate) and ongoing losses

## Treatment of Diabetes insipidus

- [[treatment of Central DI]]: [[desmopressin]] (dDAVP, 1st line), low Na/protein diet + Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorpropamide
- Nephrogenic DI:
  - treat underlying cause if possible;
  - Na restriction + HCTZ (mild volume depletion → ↓ delivery of filtrate for free H2O absorption),
  - consider amiloride for Li- induced DI (Kid Int 2009;76:44), indomethacin (NEJM 1991;324:850) or trial desmopression
- Pregnancy-induced DI:
  - due to vasopressinase from placenta
  - ∴ Rx w/ dDAVP
