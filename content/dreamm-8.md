Belantamab Mafodotin, Pomalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma

**Information**

- **Design**: Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center
- **Number of patients**: 302
- **Patients characteristics**: Lenalidomide-exposed patients who had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after at least one line of therapy
- **Agent**: Belantamab mafodotin, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (BPd) vs pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd)
- **Treatment line**: Second-line therapy or later
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: DREAMM-8 (NCT04484623, EudraCT 2018-004354-21)

**Comparison of two groups**

| Endpoint                                      | BPd                                  | PVd                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Progression-Free Survival at 12 months        | 71% (95% CI, 63 to 78)               | 51% (95% CI, 42 to 60) |
| Hazard Ratio for Disease Progression or Death | 0.52 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.73); P<0.001 | -                      |
| Response Rate (Partial Response or Better)    | 77% (95% CI, 70 to 84)               | 72% (95% CI, 64 to 79) |
| Complete Response or Better                   | 40% (95% CI, 32 to 48)               | 16% (95% CI, 11 to 23) |

**Other findings**

- Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 94% of patients in the BPd group and 76% of those in the PVd group
- Ocular events occurred in 89% of patients who received BPd (grade 3 or 4 in 43%) and 30% of those who received PVd (grade 3 or 4 in 2%)
- Ocular events led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of patients in the BPd group and in no patients in the PVd group

**Summary**
In this phase 3 trial, the combination of belantamab mafodotin, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (BPd) significantly improved progression-free survival and response rates compared to pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd) in lenalidomide-exposed patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. However, BPd was associated with more frequent ocular events, which were manageable with dose modifications.
