# hpv

[衛生福利部國民健康署 - 什麼是人類乳突病毒(HPV)？](https://www.hpa.gov.tw/Pages/Detail.aspx?nodeid=809&pid=4416)

HPV (human papillomavirus) is a small, non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Papovaviridae family. It is the primary etiological agent in cervical cancer and other carcinomas, cutaneous and mucosal papillomas[1][2].

The viral mechanism of HPV infection involves several key steps:

1. **Initial Binding**: HPV binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the basement membrane (BM) exposed after epithelial trauma. This binding is mediated by the L1 major capsid protein[1][2].

2. **Conformational Change**: The virus undergoes a conformational change that exposes the N-terminus of the L2 minor capsid protein to furin cleavage. This change is necessary for the virus to interact with the cell surface receptor[1].

3. **Secondary Receptor Interaction**: The L1 protein binds to an as yet undetermined cell surface receptor on keratinocytes that have migrated over the BM to close the wound. This interaction is necessary for internalization[1].

4. **Internalization**: The virus is internalized via a clathrin-dependent endocytic mechanism, although some HPV types may use alternative uptake pathways such as caveolae-dependent or tetraspanin-enriched domains[2][3].

5. **Endosomal Escape**: The virus escapes from the endosome by an L2-dependent mechanism, allowing the viral genome to access the cellular transcription and replication machinery[2].

6. **Nuclear Transport**: The viral genome is transported to specific subnuclear domains designated ND10 bodies, where viral gene transcription is initiated[1].

7. **Transcription and Replication**: The viral genome is transcribed and replicated in the nucleus, leading to the production of new viral particles[1].

This complex process is characterized by a slow and asynchronous entry process, with the virus residing on the cell surface for an extended period before internalization[1][2].
