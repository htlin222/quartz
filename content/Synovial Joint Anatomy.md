### Synovial Joint Anatomy

•   Joint capsule (“articular capsule”): Envelope surrounding a synovial joint that connects to the periosteum (Figure 9.2). Each capsule has two layers: 1) An outer fibrous layer, 2) An inner membrane lined by synovium

•   Synovial fluid: Viscous fluid secreted by synovial cells that lubricates the joint

•   Articular cartilage: Thin layer of hyaline cartilage, composed of type II collagen, proteoglycans, and water, that covers the articulating surface of each bone

•   Enthesis: The site at which tendons or ligaments insert into the bone
