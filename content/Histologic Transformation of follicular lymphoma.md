# Histologic Transformation of follicular lymphoma
* ~3%/y risk of transformation from FL to DLBCL,
* rapid nodal enlargement & rising LDH, Â± systemic symptoms

* Bx is required to diagnose transformation.
* PET may be useful in determining a site for bx.
* SUV values >10â€“13 suggest transformation (Ann Oncol 2009;20:508)

* Transformation to DLBCL in a previously untreated pt treated similar to de novo DLBCL
* If histologic transformation occurs after prior chemotherapy, consider consolidation w/ high dose therapy and autologous stem cell rescue in chemosensitive disease
