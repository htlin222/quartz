# treatment of Central DI

There are three major therapeutic options:

- a low-solute (sodium and protein) diet;
- desmopressin (dDAVP), an antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as arginine vasopressin [AVP]) analog;
  and other drugs,
- including [[thiazide]] diuretics.

- The choice of therapy varies with the severity of the polyuria and whether the patient has access to water and is able to drink (algorithm 1).
- Patients with partial AVP-D and mild to moderate polyuria and nocturia may be adequately controlled with a low-solute diet (if acceptable to the patient) and, if necessary, a thiazide diuretic. Although these modalities also reduce the urine output in patients with marked polyuria and nocturia, desmopressin therapy is usually required for symptom control. Desmopressin can also be used in patients with less severe AVP-D who do not want to comply with a low-solute diet. (See 'Choice of therapy' above.)
