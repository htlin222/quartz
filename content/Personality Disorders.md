### Personality Disorders

Definitions:

•   Personality: Patterns of relating to and perceiving the world and oneself that persist across multiple contexts

•   Personality disorder: The presence of traits that are maladaptive and inflexible across enough contexts to cause distress and impaired functioning within an individual’s environment/culture

##### Cluster A (“weird”)

•   Paranoid: Distrust, suspiciousness of others (often directed towards a spouse)

•   SchizoiD: **D**istant, socially withdrawn, has few friends and prefers to be alone (**“**happy loner**”**)

•   SchizoTypal: Socially withdrawal and eccentric behavior, magical **T**hinking; 10–20% children with schizotypal personality disorder ultimately develop schizophrenia

##### Cluster B (“wild”)

•   Antisocial: Violates rights of others without remorse; often history of malingering, arrests/incarcerations, and substance use disorder. Must be ≥18 yr (in children, this behavior is instead called conduct disorder). Treatment: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), although two trials have not demonstrated benefit (**Psychol Med *2009;39(4):569;* Br J Psychiatry *2007;190:307***). Other modalities not studied.

•   Borderline: Unstable mood, labile intense relationships, poorly defined sense of self, chronic feelings of emptiness, intense fear of abandonment/rejection, black/white thinking, suicidal gestures common. Treatment: dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).

•   Histrionic: Attention-seeking, provocative, exaggerated, regression to childlike behavior

•   Narcissistic: Grandiose, limited empathy, often conveys a sense of superiority but the individual actually has fragile self-esteem. Desires recognition/admiration.

##### Cluster C (“worried”)

•   Avoidant: Shy and fear of rejection but would prefer to have friends (in contrast to schizoid); very isolated

•   Dependent: Need for others to make decisions and/or care for them. Fear rejection/abandonment.

•   Obsessive-compulsive personality: Perfectionism, inflexibility, orderliness, ego-syntonic (i.e., behavior does not threaten the ego; patient does not experience behavior as an external force/impulse, in contrast with obsessive-compulsive disorder)
