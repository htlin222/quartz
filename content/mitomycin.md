# mitomycin

- Mitomycin was first isolated in 1958 from the bacterium Streptomyces caespitosus
- Mitomycin is an alkylating agent that cross-links DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis and function
- Mitomycin is activated in vivo to a bifunctional and trifunctional alkylating agent. Binding to DNA leads to cross-linking and inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. It is cell cycle phase-nonspecific
- Intravesical instillation requires maintaining urine pH > 6

## Top 10 Things for an Oncologist to Know

1. Mitomycin is a potent vesicant - extravasation can cause severe tissue damage.
2. Bone marrow suppression, particularly thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, is common and dose-limiting
3. Avoid use if serum creatinine is elevated due to increased toxicity
4. Prolonged use may result in cumulative bone marrow toxicity
5. Increased risk of heart failure when used with anthracyclines
6. Mutagenic and clastogenic - can cause chromosomal aberrations
7. Immunosuppressive effects may reduce vaccine efficacy
8. Intravesical instillation requires maintaining urine pH > 6
9. Topical ophthalmic use is the only established route for glaucoma surgery
10. Combination with newer agents and optimizing dosing are areas of active research
