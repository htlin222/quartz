# Dry tap on bone marrow aspiration

leukemia (acute and chronic) was the commonest cause of a dry tap seen in 40.3% of the patients. 
Dry tap obtained on bone marrow aspiration should serve as a red flag for the hematologist rather than a failed procedure. 
In most cases, it indicates the possibility of underlying bone marrow pathology. 
[[Trephine biopsy]] should always be studied in such cases.
