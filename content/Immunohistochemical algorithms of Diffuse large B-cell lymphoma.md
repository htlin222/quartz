# Immunohistochemical algorithms of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

- to distinguish phenotype have been developed but reliability is â†’ unclear; not routinely used to guide management.
- GCB-like defined by HANS criteria CD10+ or BCL6+/MUM1âˆ’ (>30% staining for each) (Blood 2004;103:275)
- the five histopathological subtypes of DLBCL according to WHO classification

  - Centroblastic
  - immunoblastic
  - T-cell/histiocytic-rich
  - anaplastic
  - and plasmablastic variants

| CD 10 - | BCL6 +  | BCL6 - |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| MUM +   | non-GCB | GCB    |
| MUM -   | GCB     | GCB    |

> TLDR: - + + : non GCB
