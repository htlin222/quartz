# breast cancer

- [[Epidemiology of breast cancer]]
- [[Risk factors-of-breast cancer]]
- [[Genetics-of-breast cancer]]

## Epidemiology

- Most common CA affecting women & 2nd most common cause of CA death in the United States
- In the United States, approx 286,000 new cases in 2019 & 42,000 deaths. Approx 2.2 million new cases dxâ€™d worldwide in 2020
- â†‘ incidence, but â†“ mortality in past decades (â†‘ screening, â†‘ therapeutic options)

## Risk factors

- Strongest: Female gender, â†‘ age
- â†‘ Estrogen: Early menarche, late menopause, late/nulliparity (NEJM 2006;354:270); prolonged HRT (JAMA 2003;289:3243); no increased risk w/ OCP
- Certain benign conditions â†‘ risk: Proliferative features (ductal hyperplasia, papilloma, radial scars, sclerosing adenosis); atypia (atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia); dense breast tissue (decreased mammographic sensitivity)
- No â†‘ risk from: Cysts, fibroadenoma, columnar Î”s (NEJM 2005;353:229)
- Other: BMI, FHx, smoking, EtOH, prior thoracic irradiation
- Modified Gail model: (<www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool>). Provides 5 y & lifetime risk. Average risk is â†’ <15%. Do not use Gail model if prior Dx of breast CA, DCIS, LCIS, or inherited breast CA

## Genetics

- BRCA1/2 mt: 56-84% lifetime risk of breast CA
- Other familial/hereditary breast CA: CDH1 (lobular), CHEK2 (ER+), TP53, PALB2, PTEN, ATM, NF1, STK11
