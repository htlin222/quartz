# Definitions-sepsis and shock

## Sepsis

> [!tldr] TLDR
>
> Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

.. Suspected (or documented) infection and an acute increase in ≥2 sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) points

- Life-threatening organ dysfxn (SOFA ≥2) due to infection
- Quick SOFA (qSOFA): ≥2 of the following:
  - RR ≥22, 有夠喘
  - ΔMS, 有夠昏
  - SBP ≤100 mmHg 有夠低

## [[Shock]]

# Septic shock

- Sepsis-induced circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities severe enough to ↑ mortality;
- hypotension requiring pressors for MAP ≥65 and lactate >2 despite adequate fluid resuscitation
  - 有 sepsis 而且需要用到升壓劑

## Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ([[SOFA]])

Organ dysfunction can be identified as an acute change in total SOFA score ≥2 points consequent to the infection.
