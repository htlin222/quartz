# Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index PESI

> Predicts 30-day outcome of patients with pulmonary embolism using 11 clinical criteria.

* In the setting of a patient diagnosed with PE, the PESI can be utilized to determine mortality and long term morbidity.
* For those determined to be very low risk (score â‰¤ 65), all studies showed a 30-day mortality <2%.
* In the validation, low risk (Class I and II) had a 90-day mortality of 1.1%.
* The non-inferiority trial demonstrated Class I and II could have been treated as outpatients assuming no other issues.
