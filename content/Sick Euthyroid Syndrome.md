### Sick Euthyroid Syndrome

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Illness causes caloric deprivation and an increased inflammatory state, which may lead to abnormal thyroid function tests

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Check all TFTs (TSH, total T4, free T4, T3). Interpret thyroid studies in hospitalized patients carefully.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Often no treatment needed and instead repeat TFTs in the outpatient setting once the acute illness resolves. Administering levothyroxine is not helpful unless there are other signs/symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism.

â€¢Â Â Â Pearl: If TSH undetectable or >20 mU/L, suggests true thyroid disease
