# Staging of HBV Clinical Presentation

- Current treatment recommendations depend, in part, on the amount of liver fibrosis and hepatic inflammation.
- **Liver biopsy is → the gold standard**.
- **Transient elastography** (Fibroscan) is → an acceptable alternative to liver biopsy in most cases.
- **Inflammation and fibrosis**. Battery of enzymes and serum proteins are used as a surrogate marker of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. One example is → the Fibrosure Index. Corrleation with liver biopsy fibrosis is → shown in the Figure. Accuracy of Fibrosure result is → best at ↣ the lower (<0.2) or higher (>0.8) values.
