## how to pre-round

â€¢Â Â Â Purpose of pre-rounding: Pre-rounding refers to the activity of gathering data prior to rounds, typically including 24 hour and overnight events, nursing updates/concerns, the patientâ€™s subjective report, vital signs, physical exam, labs, and other test results. Gathering this data allows you to formulate a plan for each patient that you can present on rounds.

â€¢Â Â Â Pre-rounding template: An example template for pre-rounding is provided in Table A1.7.
