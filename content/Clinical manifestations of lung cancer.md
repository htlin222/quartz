# Clinical manifestations of lung cancer

* ~10% asymptomatic at dx, detected incidentally (only 16% w/ localized dis. at presentation)
* Endobronchial growth of 1° tumor: cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, pain, wheezing, post-obstructive pneumonia; more common with squamous or small cell (central location)
* Regional spread: can cause dysphagia (esophageal compression), stridor (tracheal obstruction), hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy). Pleural effusions & pleural metastases specifically = metastatic disease = Stage IV.
* [[Pancoast’s syndrome]]
* [[SVC syndrome]] 
* Extrathoracic metastases: brain (~25% of patients at dx), bone, liver, adrenal
* [[Paraneoplastic syndromes]]
