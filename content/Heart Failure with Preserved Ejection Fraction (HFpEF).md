### Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)

â€¢Â Â Â **TOPCAT.** *N Engl J Med* 2014;370(15):1383â€“1392.

-Â Â Â This trial randomized 3445 patients with HFpEF (LVEF >45%, findings or HF, and either a HF hospitalization or elevated BNP) to receive spironolactone or placebo. Spironolactone did not reduce the composite endpoint of CV mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, or HF hospitalizations compared to placebo, but it was associated with a small reduction in HF hospitalizations. Of note, this is a controversial study due to differences in subgroup analysis by region.
