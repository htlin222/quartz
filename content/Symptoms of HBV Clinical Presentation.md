# Symptoms of HBV Clinical Presentation

- Patients with Hepatitis B ([[HBV]]) are usually asymptomatic. When symptomatic, common complaints include:
  - fatigue,
  - nausea,
  - anorexia,
  - myalgias,
  - arthralgias,
  - asthenia,
  - weight loss (except where ascites). Poor correlation between symptoms and disease stage or transaminase elevation.
- Note: For patients with cirrhosis, abrupt change in clinical symptoms or lab findings suggests [[spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]] (SBP): tap ascites!
- Depends on stage of disease.
- Skin disorders: spider angiomas.
- Stigmata of cirrhosis:
  - ascites,
  - jaundice,
  - hepatomegaly,
  - splenomegaly,
  - peripheral edema,
  - hemorrhoids,
  - caput medusa.
