# KEYNOTE-177

[Pembrolizumab in Microsatellite-Instability-High Advanced Colorectal Cancer | NEJM](https://www-nejm-org.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2017699)

- at â†£ the second interim analysis, after a median follow-up (from randomization to data cutoff) of 32.4 months (range, 24.0 to 48.3), pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to
  - progression-free survival
  - (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.80; P=0.0002).

- The estimated restricted mean survival after 24 months of follow-up was 13.7 months (range, 12.0 to 15.4) as compared with 10.8 months (range, 9.4 to 12.2).
- As of the data cutoff date, 56 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 69 in the chemotherapy group had died.
- Data on overall survival were still evolving (66% of required events had occurred) and remain blinded until the final analysis.
- An overall response (complete or partial response), as evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was observed in 43.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1% in the chemotherapy group.
- Among patients with an overall response, 83% in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 35% of patients in the chemotherapy group, had ongoing responses at â†£ 24 months.
- Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 22% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 66% (including one patient who died) in the chemotherapy group.
