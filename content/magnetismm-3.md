- Compare efficacy:

| Parameter                                   | Result      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Confirmed ORR                               | 61.0%       |
| Complete response                           | 35.0%       |
| Median duration of response                 | Not reached |
| Progression-free survival rate at 15 months | 50.9%       |
| Overall survival rate at 15 months          | 56.7%       |

- Highlight of toxicity: Common adverse events included infections, cytokine release syndrome, anemia, and neutropenia. Grade 3-4 adverse events decreased with biweekly dosing.
