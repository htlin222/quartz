# p16

p16 is a protein that plays a crucial role in head and neck cancer (HNC). Here are some key points about p16 in HNC:

1. **p16 as a Surrogate Marker of HPV Infection**:
   - HPV-positive tumors are less likely to harbor p53 mutations[1].

2. **p16 Expression and Clinicopathological Parameters**:
   - A study found a statistically significant direct association between p16 expression and age, site of the tumor, abnormal sexual habits, and lymph node involvement[1].
   - p16 expression was positively correlated with sex and site of the primary tumor, but not with age[1].

3. **[[p16_and_hpv_discordance.md|p16 and HPV Discordance]]**:
   - Discordance between p16 and HPV DNA or RNA status exists in some patients with oropharyngeal cancer, which has significant implications for prognosis[2].
   - The controversy surrounding the prognostic significance of this discordant group has been addressed through a large, multicentre study that found substantial variations in survival outcomes[2].

4. **p16 in Oropharyngeal Cancer**:
   - p16 immunohistochemistry is widely used as a biomarker assay for inferring HPV causation in oropharyngeal cancer[2].
   - The study highlights the importance of accurately classifying patients with oropharyngeal cancer to guide treatment decisions and patient counselling[2].

These findings emphasize the importance of p16 expression in understanding the etiology and prognosis of head and neck cancers, particularly in the context of HPV infection.
