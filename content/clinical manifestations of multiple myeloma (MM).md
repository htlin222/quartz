## clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma (MM)

(CRAB criteria and other less common features)

- Hyper **Calcemia** 
	due to ↑ osteoclast activity
- **Renal** disease: 
	multiple mechanisms include toxic effect of filtered light chains → renal failure (cast nephropathy) or type II RTA; amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease → nephrotic syndrome; hypercalcemia, urate nephropathy, type I cryoglobulinemia
- **Anemia** (normocytic) 
	to bone marrow involvement; rarely, may see AIHA
- Lytic **Bone** lesions
	due to ↑ osteoclast activity → pathologic fx

- Recurrent infxns 
	due to relative hypogammaglob. (clonal plasma cells suppress nl Ig)
- Neurologic: 
	cord compression; POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, skin changes) syndrome
- Hyperviscosity: 
	usually when IgM >4 g/dL, IgG >5 g/dL, or IgA >7 g/dL
- Coagulopathy: 
	seen in amyloid due to binding & depletion of Factor X
- AL amyloidosis (see “Amyloidosis”)
