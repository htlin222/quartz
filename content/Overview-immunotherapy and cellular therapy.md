# Overview-immunotherapy and cellular therapy
immunotherapy and cellular therapy

* Immune checkpoints: co-inhibitory signaling molecules that limit immune responses
* Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-assoc. protein 4 (CTLA-4): â†“ T cell activation via negative signals and ligand competition w/ CD28 (activating co-stim. molecule).
* Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1): on activated T cells, turns off T cell responses
* Prog. death-ligand 1 (PD-L1): PD-1 ligand expressed on tumor and/or immune cells
