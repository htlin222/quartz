## [[definitions of bacteremia]]

## Diagnosis

- ≥2 sets BCx prior to → abx (set = aerobic + aneaerobic cx) at ↣ separate puncture sites
- If proven bacteremia,
  - daily surveillance cxs until 48 hrs of ⊖ cxs.
  - May not need for GNRs (ClD 2017;65:1776).
- if concern for endocarditis (see IE section)
  - TTE/TEE
- if yeast is → growing in BCx
  - TTE and
  - urgent ophthalmology evaluation

## Treatment (CID 2009;49:1; JAMA 2020;323:2160)

- Empiric abx based on Gram stain, cx, & clinical syndrome, then → tailor based on sensitivities
- [[Short-Term Central Venous Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infxns]]
- Persistently ⊕ BCx: remove CVCs, look for metastatic infxn (endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteo), infected thrombosis, or prosthetic material (vascular graft, PPM)
