# Definitions-acid-base disturbances

- Acidemia → pH <7.36, alkalemia → pH >7.44; pH = 6.10 + log([HCO3]/[0.03xPCO2])
- Acidosis → process that ↑ [H+] or ↓ pH by ↓ HCO3 or ↑ PaCO2
- Alkalosis → process that ↓ [H+] or ↑ pH by ↑ HCO3 or ↓ PaCO2
- Primary disorders: metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, respiratory acidosis or alkalosis

- The physiological approach uses the carbonic acid–bicarbonate buffer system.
- Based on the isohydric principle, this system characterizes acids as hydrogen-ion donors and bases as hydrogen-ion acceptors.
- The carbonic acid–bicarbonate system is important in maintaining homeostatic control.
- In the physiological approach, a primary change in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) causes a secondary “adaptive” response in the bicarbonate concentration and vice versa; further changes in carbon dioxide or bicarbonate reflect additional changes in acid–base status.
- The four recognized primary acid–base disorders comprise two metabolic disorders (acidosis and alkalosis) and two respiratory disorders (acidosis and alkalosis).
