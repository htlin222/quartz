# laboratory and radiologic studies of rheumatoid arthritis

- RF (IgM/IgA/IgG anti-IgGAb) positive in ~70%;
  - also seen in other rheumatic diseases
    - (SLE, SjÃ¶grenâ€™s),
    - cryoglobulinemia,
    - infection (SBE, hepatitis, TB),
    - ~5% of healthy population.
- Anti-CCP (Ab to cyclic citrullinated peptide) positive in ~70% of patients with RA,
  - similar sensitivity but higher specificity (>90%) than RF,
  - particularly for early RA;
  - associated with increased joint damage and low remission rates (Arth Rheum 2009;61:1472).
- Approximately 20% of patients are seronegative (RF and anti-CCP negative).
- Increased ESR/CRP but normal in ~30%; positive ANA in ~40%; increased globulin levels during periods of active disease.
- Radiographs of hands and wrists show
  - periarticular osteopenia,
  - bone erosions, and
  - joint subluxation.
- Increasing use of MSK U/S (musculoskeletal ultrasound) to diagnose
  - synovitis,
  - tenosynovitis, and
  - erosive disease.
