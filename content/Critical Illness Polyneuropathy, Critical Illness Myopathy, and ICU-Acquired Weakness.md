# Critical Illness Polyneuropathy, Critical Illness Myopathy, and ICU-Acquired Weakness #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Critical Illness Polyneuropathy, Critical Illness Myopathy, and ICU-Acquired Weakness

â€¢Â Â Â Risk factors: Mechanical ventilation, sepsis, prolonged use of paralytics, multiorgan failure, ARDS

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical manifestations: Symmetric limb weakness (proximal > distal), respiratory muscle weakness leading to failure to wean ventilation, sparing of facial muscles

-Â Â Â Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP): Features as noted above

-Â Â Â Critical illness myopathy (CIM): Features as noted above; sensory loss may be particularly suggestive, CK may be elevated

-Â Â Â ICU-acquired weakness: Diagnosis of exclusion, first sign is often the failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, spares cranial nerves

â€¢Â Â Â Management: Minimize sedation and neuromuscular blockade, treat underlying causes, rehabilitation with early mobilization and physical therapy
