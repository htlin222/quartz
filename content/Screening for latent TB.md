  - including HIV ⊕ and prior to immunosuppression (pre-transplant or anti-TNF)
- Relies on host immune system, so limited Se in immunosuppressed individuals
- NB: testing for host exposure & immune response to TB, not whether TB active (vide infra)

    - preferred test;
    - Ag-stimulated IFN-γ release from Pt’s T-cells.
    - ↑ Sp over TST/PPD in BCG vaccinated Pts.
