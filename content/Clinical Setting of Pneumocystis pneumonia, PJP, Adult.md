# Clinical Setting of Pneumocystis pneumonia, PJP, Adult

*   Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP) is a potentially life-threatening fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, especially HIV/AIDS.
*
## [[Patients at risk PJP, Adult]]

## Indications for primary prophylaxis-chronic suppression:

*   HIV/AIDS patients with CD4 count < 200 cells/Î¼L
*   Any patient taking [[equivalent of â‰¥ 20 mg]] Prednisone/day for more than 1 month
*   Patients receiving **Alemtuzumab** (monoclonal antibody for CLL), **Temozolomide** (alkylating agent for astrocytoma therapy)
*   **Hematopoietic and solid organ transplant** recipients during immunosuppression
*   Patients given Fludarabine (purine analog used to treat hematologic malignancy)
*   Patients with **Wegener's granulomatosis treated with Prednisone + cyclophosphamide**

## Diagnosis: Sputum PCR. If not available, DFA on sputum.

Beta D-Glucan

*   Cell wall polysaccharide of *Pneumocystis* and other fungi
*   Can detect in serum with chromogenic quantitative immunoassay
*   Pooled sensitivity/specificity of 95%/86%. Negative predictive value of over 95%: Clin Micro Infect 19:39, 2013
*   Need appropriate clinical syndrome; many false positives: J ClinÂ  Micro 51:3478, 2013.

*   Concomitant antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV:
    *   NIH HIV/AIDS Guidelines recommend initiation of ART within two weeks of starting treatment for PJP (see clinicalinfo.HIV.gov)
    *   Early therapy reduced risk of progression of AIDS and death by nearly half without associated increased risk of adverse events or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
