### Metabolic Emergencies

Hypercalcemia of malignancy

•   Pathophysiology: Multiple possible mechanisms

-   Tumor secretion of PTHrP (most common) – often SCC of lung, breast cancer, RCC

-   Osteolytic metastases, which cause increased bone turnover – commonly MM, breast cancer

-   Tumor production of 1,25-OH Vit D – Hodgkin’s and NH lymphoma

•   Symptoms: “Stones, groans, moans, psychiatric overtones” – kidney stones, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bony pain, AMS

•   Diagnosis: ↑Ca2\+ level (corrected for albumin), dehydration (↑Cr, ↑Na\+)

•   Treatment:

-   Aggressive hydration (200–300 mL/hr to maintain UOP of 100–150 ml/hr). Caution in heart failure and volume overload. Generally only use diuretics if there is concern for iatrogenic hypervolemia. Effect seen: Hours.

-   Calcitonin 4IU/kg Q6–12 hrs for up to 48 hrs (patients will develop tachyphylaxis after 48 hrs of therapy). Effect seen: Hours to days.

-   Bisphosphonate: Usually zoledronic acid. One-time dose, so full dose ok in renal dysfunction and no dental evaluation needed prior to treatment. Effect seen: 2–4 days.

-   Denosumab: Monoclonal antibody to RANK-ligand → blocks activation of osteoclasts, which promote bone breakdown and Ca2\+ release. Generally, bisphosphonates are preferred over denosumab for acute treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Effect seen: 4–10 days.

##### Neutropenic fever

•   See details in the hematology section under oncologic emergencies

##### DIC and TLS

•   Less common with solid than hematologic malignancies but can occur with solid tumor malignancies

•   See details in the hematology section under oncologic emergencies
