### Glofitamab in Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

**Information**

- **Design**: Phase 2 study
- **Number of patients**: 155
- **Patients characteristics**: Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who had received at least two lines of therapy previously
- **Agent**: Glofitamab, a bispecific antibody that recruits T cells to tumor cells
- **Treatment line**: Third-line therapy or later
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: Not provided (ClinicalTrials.gov number not specified)

**Results**

- **Primary endpoint**: Complete response rate
- **Complete response rate**: 39% (95% CI, 32 to 48)
- **Median time to complete response**: 42 days (95% CI, 42 to 44)
- **Duration of response**: 78% of complete responses were ongoing at 12 months
- **Progression-free survival**: 37% (95% CI, 28 to 46) at 12 months

**Other findings**

- **Adverse events**: 63% of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome, and 62% experienced adverse events of grade 3 or higher
- **Discontinuation due to adverse events**: 9% of patients

**Summary**
The study demonstrates that glofitamab therapy is effective in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with a complete response rate of 39%. However, more than half of the patients experienced adverse events of grade 3 or higher, including cytokine release syndrome.
