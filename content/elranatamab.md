# elranatamab

Elranatamab, marketed under the brand name **Elrexfio**, is a bispecific antibody designed for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in adults. This innovative therapy was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on August 14, 2023, and subsequently received approval in the European Union in December 2023 and in Canada in January 2024[1][2][5].

## Mechanism of Action

Elranatamab functions as a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE), targeting both B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells. By binding to these two proteins, it effectively redirects T-cells to attack and destroy myeloma cells, enhancing the immune response against the cancer[1][4][5].

## Indications and Usage

This medication is specifically indicated for adults who have experienced multiple relapses and have undergone at least four prior lines of therapy, which must include a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody[1][2][4].

## Clinical Efficacy

In clinical trials, elranatamab demonstrated a significant response rate, with about 61% of patients showing a reduction in cancer following treatment. Moreover, over 70% of these patients maintained their response for at least 15 months[5]. The drug is administered subcutaneously, which offers a convenient alternative to intravenous therapies[2][3].

## Side Effects

Common adverse effects associated with elranatamab include cytokine release syndrome, fatigue, injection site reactions, and various infections. There are warnings regarding the potential for severe cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicity, necessitating careful monitoring during treatment[1][2][5].

## Conclusion

Elranatamab represents a significant advancement in the treatment options available for multiple myeloma, particularly for patients who have exhausted other therapies. Its unique mechanism of action and promising clinical results position it as a valuable addition to the therapeutic landscape for this challenging disease.
