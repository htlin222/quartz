# epithelial sodium channel - ENaC

* open in response to signals that
* sodium levels in the blood are too low,
* which allows sodium to flow into cells.
* From the kidney cells, this sodium is returned to the bloodstream (a process called reabsorption)
* rather than being removed from the body in urine.
