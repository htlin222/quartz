### Congenital Heart disease with late Cyanosis (L → R shunt)

##### Atrial septal defect (ASD)

•   Etiolgy: Defect in the middle (ostum secundum, most common) or lower (ostum primum, which occurs in Down syndrome) part of atrial septum

•   Clinical presentation: Small defects are often asymptomatic. Large ASDs are typically detected/closed in childhood; if not patients may become symptomatic by middle age, causing exercise intolerance, dyspnea, fatigue

•   Complication: Pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger syndrome, right heart failure, Afib, stroke with paradoxical emboli

•   Heart sound: Loud S1, wide fixed split S2. More pulmonic flow = mild systolic ejection murmur, diastolic rumble across the tricuspid valve

•   Treatment: Most do not require closure. When pulmonary to systemic flow is high (Qp/Qs >1.5) or RV overload, consider closure. Closure contraindicated after right to left shunt develops.

##### Patent foramen ovale (PFO)

•   Etiology: The foramen ovale is an atrial opening that usually closes at birth, PFO = persistent opening (25% of the population)

•   Clinical presentation: Common and usually benign. May cause cryptogenic strokes and select patients may benefit from closure (**CLOSE, RESPECT, REDUCE trials**)

##### Ventricular septal defect (VSD)

•   Etiology: Defect in the muscular or membranous portion of the ventricular septum

•   Associations: Fetal alcohol syndrome, Down syndrome

•   Clinical presentation: Most large VSDs are detected and closed in childhood; if not patients may become symptomatic with eventual pulmonary hypertension and right to left shunting

•   Heart sound: Harsh blowing holosystolic murmur with thrill, loudest at the left third intercostal space with handgrip (smaller defect = louder murmur)

•   Treatment: Consider closure if large, but contraindicated after right to left shunt develops

##### Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)

•   Etiology: Persistent communication between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Associated with congenital rubella, prematurity.

•   Clinical presentation: Depends on the size; small PDAs are usually asymptomatic; moderate PDAs cause Eisenmenger syndrome if not diagnosed; large PDAs cause infantile heart failure.

•   Heart sound: Machine-like murmur, best heard at the left second intercostal space; wide pulse pressure and bounding peripheral pulses.

•   Treatment: Consider closure; options include pharmacologic therapy (e.g., indomethacin; used exclusively in premature infants), surgical ligation, percutaneous catheter occlusion.

##### Coarctation of the aorta (COA)

•   Etiology:

-   Infantile: Lower extremity cyanosis with weak pulses; associated with Turner’s syndrome

-   Adult: Can also be acquired due to inflammation of the aorta (e.g., Takayasu’s)

•   Clinical presentation: Upper extremity hypertension, low/unobtainable lower extremity blood pressure, and diminished/delayed femoral pulse; CXR can reveal “notched ribs” after age 4–12 yr due to erosion by collateral arteries; in adulthood, if previously undetected, likely to present with hypertension

•   Treatment: Indicated for CoA gradient >20 mmHg, radiologic evidence of significant collaterals, hypertension due to CoA, or HF due to CoA; options include balloon angioplasty, stenting, or surgery
