## Title

Based on the search results, a BTK (Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase) inhibitor is a class of drugs that target and inhibit the activity of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase enzyme:

- BTK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the survival and proliferation of B cells [1][2][3].

- BTK inhibitors work by binding to BTK, either reversibly or irreversibly, to block its enzymatic activity and disrupt BCR signaling. This leads to reduced growth and increased apoptosis of B cells, making BTK inhibitors effective treatments for B-cell malignancies [1][2][4].

- Several BTK inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of various B-cell cancers, including ibrutinib, [[acalabrutinib.md|acalabrutinib]], and zanubrutinib [1][2][3][4][5]. These inhibitors differ in their selectivity, reversibility, and pharmacokinetic properties.

- In addition to hematological malignancies, BTK inhibitors are also being investigated for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis, and other conditions where B cells play a pathogenic role [3].

In summary, BTK inhibitors are a class of targeted therapies that block the activity of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase enzyme to disrupt B-cell signaling and function, making them an important treatment option for B-cell-driven diseases [1][2][3][4][5].
