# Management of ICU patient-pulmonary hypertension

* Avoid tachyarrhythmias & overly aggressive volume resuscitation

* Caution w/ vasodilators if any L-sided dysfunction

* Intubation can cause hemodynamic collapse

* Dobutamine and inhaled NO or prostacyclin

* Consider R-sided mechanical support (Circ 2015;132:536)

* Consider fibrinolysis if acute, refractory decompensation (eg, TPA 100 mg over 2 h)
