### Neuroimmunology

##### Multiple sclerosis (MS)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnostic criteria:

-Â Â Â Relapsing-remitting MS: An attack, relapse, or exacerbation of symptoms typical of acute inflammatory demyelinating event with duration of at least 24 hours in the absence of fever or infection and clinical and/or radiographic evidence of dissemination in space and time

-Â Â Â Primary-progressive MS: Progressive accumulation of disability from onset without clear relapses

-Â Â Â Secondary-progressive MS: Progressive accumulation of disability after an initial relapsing course

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Optic neuritis (painful vision loss or blurring, color desaturation), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, transverse myelitis

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: MRI brain (\+/â€“ MRI cervical/thoracic spine depending on symptoms) w/wo contrast, LP with basic studies, IgG index, and oligoclonal bands. Rule out other etiologies with labs including HIV antibody, RPR, TSH, B12 with MMA \+ homocysteine, ESR, CRP, ANA, Sjogrenâ€™s antibodies, ACE

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Acute: Optic neuritis- PO and IV steroids are equally efficacious. Severe symptoms such as bilateral optic neuritis or transverse myelitis with paraparesis/quadriparesis may require IV steroids or plasma exchange

-Â Â Â Chronic: Numerous disease modifying therapies, prescribed by a neurologist

-Â Â Â If known MS: Rule out pseudoflare (infection, metabolic disturbance, etc.), which worsens previous MS symptoms in the absence of a new or enhancing lesion on imaging

##### Neuromyelitis optica (NMO)

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Optic neuritis (often bilateral), acute myelitis, area postrema syndrome (hiccups, nausea, vomiting), acute brainstem syndrome, narcolepsy, symptomatic cerebral syndrome

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Serum aquaporin 4 IgG

##### Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)

â€¢Â Â Â Description: Acute demyelination within the white matter of the brain and spinal cord following a viral infection or vaccination

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Often affects children/young adults; causes encephalopathy, weakness

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Steroids, plasmapheresis

##### Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

â€¢Â Â Â Description: Progressive damage of the white matter of the brain caused by the JC virus in immunosuppressed patients

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Weakness, visual changes, speech changes, personality changes

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: No cure. Treatment aimed at reversing the immune deficiency to slow or halt disease progression

â€¢Â Â Â Prognosis: Poor prognosis, 30â€“50% fatality
