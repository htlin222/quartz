# Physical Exam #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Physical Exam

â€¢Â Â Â Purpose: The cornerstone of dermatologic diagnosis is the physical exam

â€¢Â Â Â Approach: Identify the skin lesion(s) and try to describe it using specific medical terms (Table 11.1)

-Â Â Â Be systematic (e.g., head to toe) and try to examine as much of the cutaneous surface as possible


**TABLE 11.1** â€¢ Dermatologic Terminology to Describe Skin Lesions




-Â Â Â Proper lighting is essential

-Â Â Â It is useful to describe lesions with accurate medical language. A vivid description allows both the internist and the dermatologist to develop an appropriate differential diagnosis.

-Â Â Â However, when in doubt, simply describe what you see (e.g., multiple raised purple spots on the lower extremities) â€“ this can be translated afterward into medical language
