# pathology_and_molecular_biology_of_anal_cancer

- HPV E2 peptide:
  - Attaches HPV DNA to chromatin, allowing steady viral production
- HPV E6 peptide:
  - Mediates degradation of p53, impeding cellular arrest, & apoptosis; also mediates degradation of NFX1-91 telomerase repressor
- HPV E7 peptide:
  - Inactivates pRB, promoting cell-cycle progression
- Most anal CAs are of SCC histotype.
  - Histologic variants (keratinizing, nonkeratinizing, basaloid) do not alter tx.
  - Anal adenoCA & anal melanoma per rectal CA & melanoma guidelines, respectively
