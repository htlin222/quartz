# Migraine with aura

[[aura]] 
 
Approximately one third of individuals with migraine experience aura, 
either with every attack or with some attacks. 


In >90% of affected individuals, aura manifests visually, classically as fortification spectra. 

Sensory symptoms occur in ~31% of affected individuals and are usually experienced as predominantly unilateral paraesthesia (pins and needles and/or numbness) that spreads gradually in the face or arm.

Notably, migraine with aura and migraine without aura can coexist. Many individuals with migraine with aura also experience attacks that are not preceded by aura4. In such cases, migraine with aura and migraine without aura should both be diagnosed.
