# pretreatment_considerations_of_nigro_protocol

- Emesis risk
  - LOW on all days.
- Prophylaxis for infusion reactions
  - Routine prophylaxis is not indicated.
- Vesicant/irritant properties
  - Mitomycin is a potent vesicant and can cause ulceration, necrosis, cellulitis, and tissue sloughing; avoid extravasation.[3] FU is an irritant but can cause significant tissue damage with a large volume, concentrated extravasation; avoid extravasation.[4]
- Infection prophylaxis
  - Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF not indicated; use of G-CSF should be avoided in patients receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy.
- Dose adjustment for baseline liver or kidney dysfunction
  - Lower initial doses of mitomycin may be needed in patients with kidney insufficiency. Do not use mitomycin if serum creatinine >1.7 mg/dL.[3] A lower starting dose of FU may be needed for patients with liver impairment.
