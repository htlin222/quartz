### **在光學顯微鏡下，大多數 CUP 癌症被鑑定為腺癌 (~60%) 或低分化腺癌或未分化癌或腫瘤 (~30% –35%)；其餘病灶為鱗狀細胞癌（~5%）或神經內分泌癌（~2%）。**

- On light microscopy, most CUP cancers are identified as adenocarcinoma (~60%) or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma or neoplasm (~30% –35%); the remaining lesions are squamous cell carcinoma (~5%) or neuroendocrine cancers (~2%).
