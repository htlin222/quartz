### Diagnostic Reasoning in Rheumatology

•   Most rheumatologic diseases are diagnosed “clinically” – e.g., a rheumatologist weighs the exam findings, labs, imaging and/or tissue biopsy results and makes a (sometimes tentative) diagnosis based on the strength of concordance between these findings and a given disease entity.

•   Classification criteria: Diagnostic criteria exist to ensure homogeneity of patients with rheumatologic diseases who enroll in clinical trials. Therefore, these criteria are biased in favor of specificity and NOT intended to diagnose rheumatic diseases.
