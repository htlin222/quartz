### Gilteritinib Maintenance after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in FLT3-ITD AML

**Information**

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center
- **Number of patients**: 356
- **Patients characteristics**: Adults with FLT3-ITD AML in first remission who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
- **Agent**: Gilteritinib (120 mg once daily) vs placebo
- **Treatment line**: Post-HCT maintenance therapy
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: NCT02997202

**Comparison of two groups**

| Endpoint                               | Gilteritinib                                                | Placebo |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Relapse-Free Survival (RFS)            | Hazard ratio (HR) 0.679 (95% CI, 0.459 to 1.005); P = .0518 | -       |
| RFS in patients with detectable MRD    | HR 0.515 (95% CI, 0.316 to 0.838); P = .0065                | -       |
| RFS in patients without detectable MRD | HR 1.213 (95% CI, 0.616 to 2.387); P = .575                 | -       |

**Other findings**

- 50.5% of participants had measurable residual disease (MRD) detectable pre- or post-HCT
- Gilteritinib was beneficial in patients with detectable MRD, but not in those without detectable MRD

**Summary**
In this randomized trial, gilteritinib maintenance therapy after allogeneic HCT in FLT3-ITD AML patients did not show a statistically significant improvement in relapse-free survival overall. However, a prespecified subgroup analysis revealed that gilteritinib was beneficial in patients with detectable measurable residual disease (MRD) pre- or post-HCT, supporting the use of MRD-based post-HCT therapy.
