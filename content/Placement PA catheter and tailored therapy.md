# Placement PA catheter and tailored therapy

* Insertion site: R IJ or L subclavian veins preferred for “anatomic” flotation into PA

* Inflate balloon (max 1.5 cc, mindful of resistance) when advancing and to measure PCWP

* Deflate the balloon when withdrawing and at all other times

* CXR should be obtained after placement to assess for catheter position and PTX

* If catheter cannot be floated (i.e., severe TR, RV dilatation), consider fluoroscopic guidance
