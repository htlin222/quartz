## Explain by ChatGPT


- Clostridioides difficile infection is a infection caused by a bacteria.
- Asx colonization is when the bacteria is present in the body, and is found in 3% of healthy adults, and 20% of hospitalized patients who are on antibiotics.
- Acute watery diarrhea is a symptom of the infection, as well as pseudomembranous colitis, which is when there is inflammation of the colon, and pseudomembranes, which are false membranes, present in the colon.
- Fulminant colitis is when the infection is more severe, and can cause toxic megacolon, which is when the colon doesn't work properly, and/or bowel perforation, which is when there is a hole in the bowel.
