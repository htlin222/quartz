# Comments of Neutropenia-Febrile-High-Risk

*   **Duration of empiric therapy:**Â  when clinically recovered and afebrile for 72 hrs
    *   In a multicenter randomized study, control patients continued empiric antibiotic therapy until the absolute neutrophil count was â‰¥ 0.5 x 10<sup>9 </sup> cells /L; the experimental group discontinued empiric antibiotics if clinically recovered and afebrile for 72 hrs. Early discontinuation was as safe as continuing empiric antibiotic until the marrow had recovered ([Lancet HematolÂ  2017;4:e573][22]).
    *   A retrospective study supported the recommendations of the [Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia][23] which includesÂ a strategy of stopping empiric antibacterials within 48-72h after resolution of fever ([Open Forum Infect Dis 2021][24])[][25]
*   Addition of granulocyte colony stimulating factors during neutropenic fever can be considered in patients at high-risk for infectious complications.
*   Recommendations above are based on the IDSA Practice Guidelines ([Clin Infect Dis 52:427, 2011][26]) and [National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines][27] on Prevention and Treatment of Cancer-Related Infections, Version.2019
