### Diseases involving the Vasculature

##### Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Virchowâ€™s triad: 1) Endothelial injury, 2) Venous stasis, 3) Hypercoagulability.

â€¢Â Â Â Risk factors: Older age, malignancy, prior VTE, hypercoagulable state (factor V Leiden mutation, protein C/S deficiency), prolonged bed rest, CHF, obesity, orthopedic surgery, trauma, pregnancy, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis:

-Â Â Â EKG: Classic findings: S1Q3T3, RV strain, new incomplete RBBB. Most common finding: Sinus tachycardia

-Â Â Â CXR: Classic findings (rare): Hamptonâ€™s hump, Westermarkâ€™s sign. Most common finding: Normal

-Â Â Â Wellâ€™s criteria (most commonly used, but subjective), Geneva Score (objective), **PESI score** (objective)

**â€¢**Â Â Â LOW pre-test probability â†’ D-dimer. D-dimer has high sensitivity (95%), but low specificity (50%) (**Christopher study, *JAMA* 2006**)

**â€¢**Â Â Â HIGH pretest probability (or \+D-dimer) â†’ CT-PE (**Stein et al., *New Engl J Med* 2006**)

â€¢Â Â Â Approach:

-Â Â Â Assess hemodynamic stability

**â€¢**Â Â Â If unstable, manage emergently

**â€¢**Â Â Â If stable, assess PE risk (i.e., low risk, intermediate-low risk, or intermediate-high risk)

â€¢Â Â Â Comment on PE management:

-Â Â Â Management approach for PE depends on risk stratification, features of individual patients, access to advanced therapies, and local practice

-Â Â Â Treatment modalities include tPA, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and systemic anticoagulation alone

-Â Â Â One possible approach stratified by risk classification is described on the next page

â€¢Â Â Â Classifications and management:

-Â Â Â **Massive PE** (high-risk PE)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Key features: SBP <90 mmHg, SBP drop >40 mmHg, or shock for >15 minutes despite IVF

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treatment: Fibrinolytic (catheter-directed or reduced-dose systemic thrombolysis)

-Â Â Â Absolute contraindications to tPA: History of hemorrhagic stroke or stroke of unknown origin; ischemic stroke in previous 6 months; central nervous system neoplasm; major trauma, surgery, or head injury in previous 3 weeks; bleeding diathesis; active bleeding

-Â Â Â **Nonmassive PE**

**â€¢**Â Â Â **Intermediate-high risk PE**

-Â Â Â Key features: Acute PE without hypotension but with evidence of abnormal RV function by echocardiography (or a clearly dilated right ventricle by CT pulmonary angiography), plus an elevated troponin and/or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level; BOVA score >4 may also be suggestive

-Â Â Â Treatment: Anticoagulation, plus multidisciplinary discussion about role for fibrinolytics (systemic vs. catheter-directed)

**â€¢**Â Â Â **Intermediate-low-risk PE**

-Â Â Â Key features: Acute PE without hypotension or evidence of abnormal RV function, but sPESI screen is positive (i.e., at least one of the following: Age >80 yr, cancer, cardiopulmonary disease, HR >110 bpm, SBP <100 mmHg, SpO2 <90%)

-Â Â Â Treatment: Anticoagulation

**â€¢**Â Â Â **Low-risk PE**

-Â Â Â Key features: Acute PE with negative sPESI screen (i.e., all of the following: Age <80 yr, no cancer, no cardiopulmonary disease, HR <110 bpm, SBP >100 mmHg, SpO2 >90%)

-Â Â Â Treatment: Consider outpatient management with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC); admission may be appropriate based on safety of discharge plan, likelihood of follow-up, etc.
