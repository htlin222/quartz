# germinal-center B-cell

- High-grade B-cell lymphoma w/ _MYC & BCL2_ &/or BCL6 translocations by FISH (formerly “[[double-hit in DLBCL]]”) represent ∼8% of all DLBCL & have poorer prog.
  - Almost always GCB.
  - IHC detected “double expressors” (MYC >40% BCL2 >70%) may be assoc w/ ↓ prog (JCO 2012;30:3460).
  - Burkitt typically BCL-2(−) vs. DLBCL nearly always BCL2(+)
