# Local management with surgery and radiation-of-localized breast cancer

- Mastectomy = lumpectomy + RT in OS (NEJM 2002;347:1227)
- [[SLNB]]
- [[ALND]]
- RT: No OS for RT after BCS for pts >70 yo, ER+, & node (âˆ’) (CALGB 9343, JCO 2013;31:2382)
- [[Post mastectomy RT]]
- Consider addition of regional nodal irradiation to whole-breast irradiation after BCS if pos. LN (NEJM 2015;373:307; NEJM 2015;373:317)

## General (neo)adjuvant principles

- Aims: â†“ recurrence risk & â†‘ survival, NAC âˆ¼ adj. (JCO 2008;26:778)
- [[aims of NAC in breast cancer]]
- Recurrence:
  - TNBC, HER2+ mostly in 1st 3-5 y.
  - ER+ steady risk 0-14 y
- Isolated local recurrence:
  - Tx decision case-by-case;
  - chemo benefit limited to ER-neg dz (CALOR, Lancet Onc 2014;15:156)
