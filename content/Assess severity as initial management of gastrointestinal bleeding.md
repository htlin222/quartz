# Assess severity as initial management of gastrointestinal bleeding

> VS including orthostatic Î”s, JVP. Tachycardia (can be masked by Î²B use) suggests **10% volume loss**, orthostatic hypotension 20% loss, shock >30% loss.

Scoring predicts rebleeding & mortality: AIMS65, ABC Score & Glasgow-Blatchford.


* When assessing vital signs, it is important to consider changes in blood pressure when moving from a lying down to a standing position (orthostatic changes), as well as the jugular venous pressure (JVP).

* Tachycardia, which can be masked by beta-blocker use, can indicate a 10% loss of blood volume.
*
* Orthostatic hypotension may indicate a 20% loss of blood volume, and shock can occur with a loss of more than 30% of blood volume.

## Scoring systems
such as [[AIMS65]], [[ABC Score]], and [[Glasgow-Blatchford]], can be used to predict the likelihood of rebleeding and mortality.
