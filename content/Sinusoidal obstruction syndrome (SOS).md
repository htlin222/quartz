# Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)

(Bone Marrow Transplant 2020:55:485)

* Occlusion hepatic venules & sinusoids (formerly veno-occlusive disease) 2/2 toxic insult

## Etiologies:
* post HSCT (15%),
* chemo (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine),
* XRT, bush tea

## Clinical manifestations:
* painful hepatomegaly,
* RUQ pain,
* ascites,
* weight gain,
* ↑ bilirubin


## Dx:
* U/S w/ reversal of portal flow
* dx made clinically
	* early weight gain
	* ↓ plt refractory to transfusion
	* ↑ bili, hx of recent toxins
* if necessary, liver bx or HVPG (>10 mmHg)

## Rx:
* supportive,
* diuretics;
* if severe → early [[defibrotide]] ↑ survival,
	* but side effects & expensive

## Ppx
* defibrotide
* ursodeoxycholic acid for high-risk HSCT pop
* ? low-dose heparin

incidence ~10%, mortality ~30%

* Previously known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (BBMT 2016;22:400).
* Mechanism: direct cytotoxic injury to hepatic venules → in situ thrombosis.
* Symptoms: tender hepatomegaly, ascites, jaundice, fluid retention with severe disease → liver failure, encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome
* Diagnosis: ↑ ALT/AST, ↑ bilirubin; ↑ PT with severe disease; Doppler U/S may show reversal of portal vein flow; ↑ hepatic wedge pressure; abnl liver bx
* Treatment: supportive; prophylaxis with ursodiol; treat w/ defibrotide (Blood 2016;127:1656)
