# Diagnostics for active TB

(CID 2017;64:11)

- Pulmonary TB:

  - common CXR findings discussed above;
  - induced sputum AFB smear & culture (3 samples at ↣ least 8 h apart)
  - ± NAAT/ PCR (GeneXpert);
  - consider bronchoscopy + BAL ± transbronchial biopsy.
  - GeneXpert can also detect RIF resistance (non-bloody sputum only).
  - Sp 98%/Se 74%,
  - independent of HIV status.

- BUG: Interferon-gamma release assay 沒辦法區分 active 和 latent TB
