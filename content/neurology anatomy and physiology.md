## neurology anatomy and physiology

In neurology, we talk about “localizing” a lesion.

•   Step 1: Where is the lesion that is responsible for a patient’s signs and symptoms?

•   Step 2: Based on the location, what are the possible etiologies of the signs and symptoms?

These steps require a clear understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the central and peripheral nervous systems and blood supplies. A helpful tip is to learn to map signs and symptoms to a location (e.g., vertigo, diplopia, and nystagmus = brainstem).
