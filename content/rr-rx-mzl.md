# rr-rx-mzl

- General approach:
  - Treat w/ nonoverlapping combination regimens + anti-CD20 (if >6 mos since last exposure)
  - (benda + R/obinituzumab, R-CHOP, R-CVP, len + R) or BTKi
- Ibrutinib (BTKi) w/ ORR 48%, PFS 14.2 mos in phase II trial,
  - likely due to MZL dependence on B-cell receptor signaling (Blood 2017;129:2224; Blood Adv 2020;4:5773)

- Ibrutinib shows long-term safety and effectiveness in relapsed/refractory MZL.
- Patients with only prior RTX treatment had better outcomes than those who also received chemotherapy.
- Findings support ibrutinib use regardless of MZL subtype.

- PI3K inhibitors: [[copanlisib.md|Copanlisib]], [[duvelisib.md|duvelisib]], idelalisib, umbralisib (dual PI3K‚àÇ/CK1Œµ). Umbralisib is FDA approved for MZL (ASH 2020;Abs 623)
