## Concordance

- Sometimes explained as the _absence of_ a “RS complex,” concordance simply means “all up” or “all down.’
- A simple way to think of this would be to ask the question
  - Are all QRS complexes completely upright (positive) or completely downward (negative) in the precordial leads ?
  - If the answer is → yes, then → VT is → the diagnosis.
