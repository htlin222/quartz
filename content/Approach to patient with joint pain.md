â€¢ Inflammatory vs. noninflammatory pain: features of inflammatory arthropathy include joint swelling, warmth or redness, prolonged morning stiffness (>30 min), improvement of pain/stiffness w/ motion/exercise. Assess for extra-articular features.
â€¢ Physical exam: localize complaint, identify signs of inflammation, and assess number and pattern of affected joints.
