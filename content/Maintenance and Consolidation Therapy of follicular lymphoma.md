# Maintenance and Consolidation Therapy of follicular lymphoma

* Maintenance dosing of rituximab after completing initial Rx improves PFS but not OS (JNCI 2011;103:1799)
	* No trials have directly evaluated the role of maintenance obinutuzumab. If maintenance therapy is recommended, obinutuzumab-chemo â†’ obinutuzumab maintenance is superior to R-chemo â†’ R maintenance (GALLIUM Study, ASH 2016).
	* RIT also improves PFS but not OS, converts some PRs to CRs (JCO 2008;26:5156)
