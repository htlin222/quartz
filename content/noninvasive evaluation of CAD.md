# [[Test-results-noninvasive evaluation of CAD]]

* [[Stress testing]] (J Nucl Cardiol 2016;23:606; EHJ 2020;41:407)
* [[Exercise-tolerance-test]] (w/ ECG alone)
* [[Pharmacologic-stress-test]] (nb, requires imaging because ECG not interpretable)
* [[Imaging-for-stress-test]]

## High-risk test results (PPV ~50% for LM or 3VD, ∴ consider coronary angio)
* ECG: ST ↓ ≥2 mm or ≥1 mm in stage 1 or in ≥5 leads or ≥5 min in recovery; ST ↑; VT
* Physiologic: ↓ or fail to ↑ BP, <4 METS, angina during exercise, Duke score ≤–11; ↓ EF
* Radionuclide: ≥1 lg or ≥2 mod. reversible defects, transient LV cavity dilation, ↑ lung uptake

* [[Myocardial viability]] (Circ CV Imaging 2020;13:e53)
* [[Coronary CT angiography]] (JCCT 2021;15:192)
* [[Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score]]
