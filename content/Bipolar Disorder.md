### Bipolar Disorder

â€¢Â Â Â **The STEP-BD Trial.** *N Engl J Med* 2007;356:1711â€“1722.

-Â Â Â Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial assessing the use of a mood stabilizer plus an antidepressant vs. a mood stabilizer alone for reducing bipolar depression symptoms (without increasing the risk of mania). Combined therapy did not demonstrate increased efficacy and demonstrated similar rates of treatment-emergent affective switch.

â€¢Â Â Â **BALANCE Trial.** *Lancet* 2010;375(9712):385â€“95.

-Â Â Â Open-label, randomized clinical trial evaluating lithium monotherapy, valproic acid (VPA) monotherapy, and combination therapy in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Lithium monotherapy or lithium \+ VPA > VPA monotherapy. Results could neither confirm nor refute a benefit of lithium \+ VPA compared to lithium alone.
