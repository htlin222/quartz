# Rationale of BIPSS

In the setting of hypercortisolemia, the procedure is performed to differentiate a pituitary from an ectopic source of ACTH.

ACTH is expected to be found at a higher concentration close to the gland with respect to distant location where admixture with blood from the systemic circulation occurs; the higher concentration of ACTH near the pituitary suggests pituitary ACTH excess as the cause of hypercortisolism.

The suppression of normal corticotrophs by the longstanding hypercortisolemia is crucial for the diagnostic accuracy of BIPSS, because it ensures that any ACTH measured is secreted by tumor tissue (pituitary or ectopic).
