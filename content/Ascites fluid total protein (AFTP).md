# Ascites fluid total protein (AFTP)

- <2.5 (Pre- & Intrahepatic)
- ≥2.5 (Post-hepatic)

- useful when SAAG ≥1.1 to →
  - distinguish cirrhosis (AFTP <2.5 g/dL) ← from
    - Ascitic protein <2.5 g/dL
    - Cirrhosis
    - Late Budd-Chiari syndrome
    - Massive liver metastases
  - cardiac ascites (AFTP ≥2.5 g/dL).
- Low AFTP (<1 g/dL) assoc. w/ ↑ risk of SBP (see “Cirrhosis” for guidelines on SBP Ppx based on [[AFTP]]).
  - I Heart failure/constrictive pericarditis
  - Early Budd-Chiari syndrome
  - IVC obstruction, SVC syndrome
  - Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome
