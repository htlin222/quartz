### Other Statistical Concepts and Formulas

â€¢Â Â Â Standard deviation (SD): For normal distribution, 68% of results within one SD, 95% of results within two SDs, 99% of results within three SDs

â€¢Â Â Â Standard error of the sample mean (SEM): SD/âˆš*n*, where *n* = sample size

â€¢Â Â Â p-values: Probability that result achieved by chance, e.g., p = 0.01 means 1% probability that the result occurred by chance

â€¢Â Â Â Confidence interval (CI): Mean \+/â€“ *Z*(SEM); when *Z* = 1.96, calculates 95% CI

-Â Â Â When comparing means, if the 95% CI includes 0, then there is no difference (assuming significance is a p-value <0.05)

-Â Â Â When comparing OR or RR, if the 95% confidence interval includes 1, then there is no difference (assuming significance is a p-value <0.05)

â€¢Â Â Â Comparing means:

-Â Â Â **T**-test: Compares Two means

-Â Â Â ANOVA: Compares three or more means

â€¢Â Â Â Comparing categorical variables:

-Â Â Â **C**hi2: Compares 2\+ proportions (**C**ategorical variables)

â€¢Â Â Â Error:

-Â Â Â Type I error (Î±): Stating that there is an effect when none exists (Î± <0.05)

**â€¢**Â Â Â False positive rate = FP/(FP\+TN)

-Â Â Â Type II error (Î²): Stating that there is not an effect when there really is one

**â€¢**Â Â Â False negative rate = FN/(FN\+TP)

-Â Â Â Power (1-Î²): Probability of rejecting the null when it is false
