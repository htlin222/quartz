Abd U/S: bowel gas often obscures pancreas visualization; however should be ordered to r/o biliary etiology (ie, gallstones, BD dilatation)

Abd CT: not rec for first 3 days (local complic. not yet visible & concern for AKI w/ IV contrast). However, if persistent pain and/or clinical deterioration after 48â€“72 h, CT(I+) useful to r/o local complications (necrosis, fluid collections).

MRI/MRCP: Can detect necrosis, assess for stones & ductal disruption earlier than CT

Endoscopic U/S (EUS): useful for occult biliary disease (microlithiasis)
