### Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology:

-Â Â Â In adults â‰¤30 yr, primary CNS tumors more common. See Table 7.7.

-Â Â Â In adults >30 yr, brain metastases are more common (breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, melanoma)

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Small lesions can be asymptomatic. If symptomatic: Headache, signs of increased intracranial pressure (nausea/vomiting), new onset seizures, focal neurologic deficits.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: MRI with contrast (much superior sensitivity than head CT). LP not typically needed unless concern for leptomeningeal disease (LMD). Tissue diagnosis via stereotactic biopsy vs. open surgery. Biopsy often not pursued for metastatic cancer with known primary site unless surgical resection is indicated for symptom-related reasons.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Glucocorticoids can reduce cerebral edema; then treatment depending on tumor type.
