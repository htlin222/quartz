# Diagnostic clues that favor VT

(assume until proven o/w)

- Prior MI, CHF, or LV dysfunction best predictors that WCT is VT (Am J Med 1998;84:53)
- Hemodynamics and rate do not reliably distinguish VT from SVT
- MMVT is regular, but initially it may be slightly irregular, mimicking AF w/ aberrancy; grossly irregularly irregular rhythm suggests AF w/ aberrancy or pre-excitation
- ECG features that favor VT (Circ 2016;133:e506)
-[[Brugada Criteria]] 
  - _AV dissociation_ (independent P waves, capture or fusion beats) proves VT
  - Very wide QRS (>140 ms in RBBB-type or >160 in LBBB-type);
  - extreme axis deviation
  - QRS morphology atypical for BBB (longest precordial RS >100 ms and R wider than S)
  - RBBB-type:
    - absence of tall Râ€² (or presence of monophasic R) in V1,
    - r/S ratio <1 in V6
  - LBBB-type:
    - onset to nadir >60 ms in V1,
    - q wave in V6
- Initial R wave in aVR; concordance (QRS in all precordial leads w/ same pattern/direction)
