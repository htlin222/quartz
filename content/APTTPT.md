# APTTPT

# Mild PT and severe APTT prolong, etiology to be determined, mild easily ecchymosis recently, no but menorrahgia, suspected asymptomatic lupus anticoagulant, rule out factor deficiency, rule out super wafarin intoxicification but not likely

- No chinese medicine or other drug exposure except drinking some collagen fiber `___`
- Previous APTT/PT data if available
  - check mixing test `___`
  - check for factors IVVV, IX, or XI, and lupus anticoagulant activity
  - Check PT/APTT again on `___`/`___`/`___`
  - If the aPTT is prolonged and the PT is normal, we do a mixing study.
  - If the mixing study corrects, then we perform assays for factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII.
  - Even though factor XII deficiency is not associated with bleeding, it may explain a prolonged aPTT that corrects with mixing.
  - If the mixing study fails to correct,
    - we test for the presence of a lupus anticoagulant and factor VIII activity (the latter to detect a rare patient with acquired hemophilia A).
