# PALOMA-3

- Overall Survival with Palbociclib and Fulvestrant in Advanced Breast Cancer
- N Engl J Med 2018; 379:1926-1936

## The Effect of Palbociclib on Overall Survival in Hormone-Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer: A Prespecified Analysis by Endocrine Sensitivity, Visceral Metastases, and Age

1. Design:
   - Phase: III
   - Randomized
   - Double-blind
   - Multicenter
2. Number of Patients: 521
3. Patients Characteristics:
   - Hormone-receptor-positive
   - HER2-negative
   - Advanced breast cancer
   - Progression or relapse during previous endocrine therapy
4. Agent:
   - Palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant
5. Treatment Line: Advanced breast cancer
6. Trial Name: PALOMA-3 (NCT01942135)
7. Comparison of two groups:

   | Outcome Measure           | Palbociclib-Fulvestrant | Placebo-Fulvestrant |
   | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
   | Progression-free survival | 9.5 months              | 4.6 months          |
   | Overall survival          | 34.9 months             | 28.0 months         |
   | Response rate             | 42.1%                   | 28.3%               |

8. Other findings:
   - No new safety signals were observed with 44.8 months of follow-up.
   - The median duration of subsequent therapy was similar in the two groups.
   - The median time to receipt of chemotherapy was 17.6 months in the palbociclib-fulvestrant group, compared with 8.8 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group.
9. Summary:
   The clinical trial results demonstrate that treatment with palbociclib-fulvestrant resulted in significantly longer overall survival in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had sensitivity to previous endocrine therapy. The study provides evidence for the use of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant as a standard treatment option for this patient population.
