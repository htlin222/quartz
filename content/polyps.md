## Pathophysiology & epidemiology (NEJM 2016;374:1065)

- Accumulation of mutations in colonic epithelial cell DNA affecting oncogenes & tumor suppressor genes
  - → tumor initiation (formation of adenoma; APC loss of fxn)
  - → tumor progression (adenoma → carcinoma; K-ras gain of fxn, DCC, p53 loss of fxn)
- [[increased risk for colorectal cancer]]
- [[Protective factors for colorectal cancer]]
- [[Neoplastic polyps]]
- [[Non-neoplastic polyps]]
- [[CRC screening]]
