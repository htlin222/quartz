Classical HL characterized pathologically by the Reed–Sternberg Cell: large, multinucleated cell w/ classic “owl’s eyes” appearance & stains (+) for CD15 & CD30

Subtypes of Classical HL include: Nodular sclerosis (most common), lymphocyte rich, mixed cellularity, & lymphocyte depleted. Tx does not differ among these subtypes

The most common genetic alterations in cHL are amplification of
9p24.1 containing the PD-L1, PD-L2, & JAK2 genes as well as Mts of the
beta-2 microglobulin gene resulting in immune evasion
