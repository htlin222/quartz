### Heart Failure (HF)

•   Etiology:

-   Left-sided HF: Ischemic vs. nonischemic (e.g., arrhythmia or tachycardia-mediated; valvular disease; hypertension; drugs/toxins \[chemotherapy, alcohol, stimulants\]; infiltrative diseases \[sarcoid, amyloid, hemochromatosis\])

-   Right-sided HF: Most often due to L-sided heart failure. Other causes: cor pulmonale (e.g., due to OSA, COPD, pulmonary arterial hypertension)

•   Symptoms: Dyspnea, decreased exercise capacity, orthopnea, PND, nocturnal cough, fatigue, edema, abdominal bloating, early satiety

•   Physical exam:

-   Signs of congestion: S3, pulmonary crackles, Cheyne-Stokes respirations (deep/fast breathing cycling with apnea), jugular venous distention, hepatojugular reflex, hepatomegaly, pulsatile liver, lower extremity or sacral edema, IVC >2.1 cm and <50% collapsible on POCUS, B-lines on lung POCUS (Table 1.11)


**TABLE 1.11 • Heart Failure: Signs of Congestion and Low Cardiac Output**




-   Signs of low cardiac output: Cool extremities, narrow pulse pressure, weak pulse, low SBP, altered mental status, reduced urine output (Table 1.11)

-   Other notable findings: Irregular rhythm, tachycardia, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), murmurs (e.g., MR, AS, TR), S4, reduced EF on POCUS

•   Classification:

-   American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) stages and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes:

**•**   **A** – At risk of HF but no diagnosis

**•**   **B** – Structural heart disease but without symptoms of HF

-   NYHA I – No limitations on physical activity

**•**   **C** – Structural heart disease with symptoms of HF

-   NYHA II – Slight limitation on physical activity, ordinary activity does not cause symptoms

-   NYHA III – Marked limitation on physical activity, ordinary activity causes symptoms

**•**   **D** – Refractory HF requiring advanced therapies

-   NYHA IV – Symptoms at rest and inability to participate in physical activity

•   Diagnosis and work-up of heart failure:

-   TTE: Do when euvolemic

**•**   EF <40%: HF with reduced EF (HFrEF)

**•**   EF >50% with diastolic dysfunction: HF with preserved EF (HFpEF)

**•**   EF 40–50%: HF with mid-range EF (HFmrEF)

-   CXR: Kerley B-lines, pleural effusions, prominent interstitial markings and alveolar opacities (“butterfly” pattern)

-   Natriuretic peptides: Peptides released from the ventricles in response to stretch; elevated in acute and chronic HF but also increase with age, valvular disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial arrhythmias (e.g., Afib), sepsis, CKD; false negative in obesity; useful to trend when patient’s baseline is known; has prognostic value in HF

**•**   B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP): Uninterpretable in patients on sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto)

-   Can be used to exclude diagnosis of HF (**“Breathing Not Properly” Study 2003**)

•   <20 pg/mL = Rule out HF in asymptomatic outpatient with 96% NPV

•   <40 pg/mL = Rule out HF in symptomatic outpatient with 96% NPV

•   <50 pg/mL = Rule out Acute Decompensated HF (ADHF) in ED patient with 96% NPV

•   <100 pg/mL = Rule out ADHF in ED with 90% NPV

-   Can be used to identify HF:

•   >400 pg/mL = Identify ADHF in ED with 86% PPV

**•**   NT-proBNP: Useful in patients on sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), <300 pg/mL useful to rule out ADHF in ED with 99% NPV (**PRIDE study 2005**)

-   ECG: Look for signs of the cause of HF such as LVH, atrial arrhythmias, tachycardia, Q waves, active ischemia, pacing spikes; low voltage ECG with LVH on ECHO suggests infiltrative disease

-   Troponin: Rule out active ischemia/ACS

-   Sodium: Hyponatremia may occur due to volume retention, diuretic use, increased neurohumoral activation; Na\+ <135 mEq/L associated with increased mortality in HF

-   Assess severity of advanced heart failure: BUN/Cr, LFTs, lactate

-   Assess for co-occurring conditions: HgA1c, lipid panel, TSH, iron studies

-   Assess heart failure etiology: Stress test or coronary angiogram (depending on pre-test probability of CAD), HIV, Utox, Upreg; sometimes: SPEP/SFLC, cardiac MRI, endomyocardial biopsy

•   Goals of hospitalization for ADHF:

-   Decongestion: IV diuretics (see Table 1.12; typically start by doubling the patient’s home diuretic dose, ensure urination within 30 min), BID electrolytes (repletion of K >4 mmol/L and Mg >2 mg/dL), strict I/Os (goal negative >2 L daily or more if tolerated), diurese fully to euvolemia (i.e., no JVD, no crackles, IVC<2.1 cm and >50% collapsible), establish dry weight, trial on PO diuretics prior to discharge


**TABLE 1.12 • Diuretics**




-   Define and reverse triggers: **FAILURES** mnemonic

**•**   **F**orgetting (i.e., not taking heart failure medications)

**•**   **A**rrhythmia (especially Afib)

**•**   **I**schemia

**•**   **L**ifestyle (e.g., fluids, alcohol, salt, drugs)

**•**   **U**p-regulation (e.g., in pregnancy, hyperthyroidism)

**•**   **R**enal failure

**•**   **E**mbolism

**•**   **S**tenosis (e.g., aortic stenosis, renal artery stenosis)

-   Establish HF etiology: Reassess the reason that the patient has HF, determine if additional workup is required to define the etiology

-   Initiate and up-titrate guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): Prior to discharge, try to get patients on the maximum tolerated ACEi/ARB/ARNI, BB, MRA, SGLT2 inhibitor as indicated (see later)

-   Prevent rehospitalization: Schedule outpatient follow-up within 2 weeks to reassess volume exam, weight, labs, and medication tolerance

-   Additional measures for severe ADHF:

**•**   Noninvasive ventilation (NIV): Respiratory support for cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPAP preferred, may trial bilevel NIV if hypercapnia present)

**•**   Inotropes: Dobutamine or milrinone

**•**   Pulmonary artery catheter (Swann-Ganz catheter): Continuously measures cardiac and pulmonary pressures and can calculate cardiac output; has not been shown to improve outcomes in ADHF (**ESCAPE 2005**), but has a role in some patients, particularly those with cardiogenic shock, mixed shock, RV failure due to pulmonary hypertension, or those with a challenging clinical assessment

-   Treatment: Depends on the type of heart failure, as described below

##### HFrEF (EF <40%): Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

•   Lifestyle: Sodium restriction (<4 g/day), weight loss, smoking cessation, restrict alcohol, daily weights

•   Symptomatic relief: Diuretics. Common recommendation for patients: If weight increases 3–5 lb, double diuretic and K\+ repletion and call provider.

•   Guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF: Medications with mortality benefit

-   **ACE inhibitor (ACEi)** (**SAVE 1992, SOLVD 1991**)

**•**   ~20% mortality reduction

**•**   Recommended for EF <40%, NYHA I-IV

**•**   Medications: Lisinopril (initial = 2.5–5 mg qD; goal = 40 mg qD). Alternatively, can use short-acting captopril (initial = 6.25 mg TID; goal = 50 mg TID) for easier titration inpatient then convert to once-daily lisinopril prior to discharge. Ratio captopril:lisinopril is 5:1 (captopril 50 mg TID = lisinopril 30 mg qD). Other options: benazepril, enalapril, ramipril

**•**   Side effects: Hypotension, hyperkalemia, cough; careful in CKD, bilateral renal artery stenosis. Teratogen

-   **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** (**Val-HeFT 2001; HEAAL 2009**)

**•**   ~15% mortality reduction

**•**   Recommended for EF <40%, NYHA II–IV

**•**   Medications: Losartan (initial = 12.5–25 mg; goal = 50 mg daily). Alternative for patients who do not tolerate ACEi (usually due to cough). Other options: valsartan, candesartan

**•**   Side effects: Hypotension, hyperkalemia. Cough less common with ARBs than ACEi, but can occur. Teratogen

-   **Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) \+ ARB (sacubitril/valsartan \[Entresto\]) (PARADIGM-HF 2014)**

**•**   Up tô15% mortality reduction (over ACEi)

**•**   Recommended for EF ≤35% and BNP ≥150 pg/mL ***or*** NT-proBNP ≥600 pg/mL ***or*** hospitalization

**•**   Medications: Sacubitril/valsartan (initial = 24/26 mg BID; goal = 97/103 mg BID)

**•**   Side effects: Hyperkalemia, angioedema. Do not combine with ACEi due to risk of angioedema

-   **Beta blockers** (**MERIT-HF 1999**)

**•**   ~35% mortality reduction

**•**   Recommended for EF <40%, NYHA I–IV

**•**   Medications: Carvedilol if hypertensive (initial 3.125 mg BID; goal = 25 mg BID) or metoprolol succinate if normotensive (initial = 12.5–25 mg qD; goal = 200 mg qD). When up-titrating can start with metoprolol tartrate q6h and then convert total daily dose 1:1 to metoprolol succinate at discharge

**•**   Side effects: Hypotension, bradycardia

**•**   Note: OK to continue home BB in stable patient with ADHF but do not start new BB until nearing euvolemia

-   **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)** (**RALES 1999, EMPHASIS-HF 2011**)

**•**   ~30% mortality reduction

**•**   Recommended for EF ≤35%, NYHA II–IV

**•**   Medications: Spironolactone (initial 12.5–25 mg qD; goal = 50 mg qD) or eplerenone (initial 25 mg qD; goal 50 mg qD, less gynecomastia)

**•**   Side effects: Hyperkalemia. Do not use in CKD (Cr >2.5)

-   **SGLT2 inhibitors** (**DAPA-HF 2019**)

**•**   ~20% mortality reduction (over standard guideline-directed medical therapy \[GDMT\])

**•**   Recommended for EF ≤40%, especially in patients with diabetes

**•**   Medications: Dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin

•   Less frequently used:

-   **Hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate** (**A = HeFT 2004**)

**•**   Mortality reduction in persons who self-identified as Black (defined as of African descent). Beneficial if hypertensive and/or symptomatic despite GDMT, especially in African American patients

**•**   Medications: Hydralazine 37.5–75 mg/Isordil 20–40 mg TID

-   **Ivabradine (SHIFT 2010)**

**•**   No mortality reduction

**•**   SA node (funny current) blocker. Consider if HR<70 bpm after on maximum dose beta blocker

-   **Tolvaptan**

**•**   No mortality reduction

**•**   Consider if severe hyponatremia (e.g., Na\+ <120 mEq/L) despite fluid restriction. Initiated inpatient only with close sodium monitoring.

**•**   Do not use for >30 days. Do not use in liver disease.

-   **Digoxin**

**•**   Unclear mortality benefit and potential for harm. Consider rarely if a patient is symptomatic despite GDMT.

**•**   Dose 0.125 mg daily and maintain serum digoxin level <1 ng/mL

**•**   Side effects: Dizziness, diarrhea, rash, confusion

•   Procedures:

-   **Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD):** Consider if EF <35% after 3–6 months on medical therapy, for prevention of sudden cardiac death.

-   **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT):** Cardiac resynchronization (placement of a pacemaker with RV and LV leads to synchronize RV/LV contraction). Consider if EF <35%, NYHA II–IV, wide QRS (at least >120 ms; particularly with LBBB) after optimal medical therapy for 3–6 months.

-   **CardioMEMS:** Implantable device that monitors changes in pulmonary artery pressure to allow clinicians to remotely titrate diuretics. Consider in patients with frequent hospitalizations, difficult to manage volume status.

•   Advanced therapies: Consider in ACC/AHA Stage D/NYHA IV despite guideline-directed medical therapy:

-   **LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device):** For bridge to transplant or destination therapy

-   **Heart transplant**

-   **IV inotropic therapy:** For symptom benefit/quality of life often as a bridge to transplant

-   **Palliative care:** For symptom benefit/quality of life

##### HFmrEF (EF 40–50%): Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction

•   Definition: Between HFrEF and HFpEF. Recognized by most as a subcategory of HFreF

•   Treatment: Unclear how exactly to manage given limited clinical trials directed at this population, but generally treated like HFrEF

##### HFrecEF (EF < 40% that improves to > 50%): Heart failure with recovered ejection fraction

•   Definition: HFrEF that recovers over time with treatment

•   Treatment: Unclear exactly how to manage but should NOT stop HFrEF therapies

##### HFpEF (EF > 50% \+ clinical symptoms of HF): Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

•   Treatment: Data less clear; unclear if standard HFrEF medications help this population, but trials have largely not shown benefit

•   Mainstays of treatment:

-   Management of hypertension

-   Diuretics, lifestyle changes, consideration of remote hemodynamic monitoring (e.g., CardioMEMs) when difficult to control - MRAs: Spironolactone decreases hospitalizations (**TOPCAT 2014**; controversial study due to differences in subgroup analysis by region)

-   SGLT-2 inhibitors may have benefit (trials on-going)
