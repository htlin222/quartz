[Bevacizumab Beyond First Progression is â†’ Associated With Prolonged Overall Survival in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Results From a Large Observational Cohort Study (BRiTE) | Journal of Clinical Oncology](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2008.16.3212)

1. Design: observational, bevacizumab treatment study (Bevacizumab Regimens: Investigation of Treatment Effects and Safety [BRiTE]), single-center, not randomized, open-label.

| Group/Outcome | No post-PD | No BBP | BBP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Median OS | 12.6 months | 19.9 months | 31.8 months |
| HR (vs No BBP) | Not reported | 0.48 | Not reported |
| P value | Not reported | < .001 | Not reported |
| Hypertension that required medication | Not reported | 19.2% | 24.6% |
