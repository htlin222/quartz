* intensive (i.e., tight) control target of 81 to 108 mg per deciliter (4.5 to 6.0 mmol per liter), based on that used in previous studies,
* conventional-control target of 180 mg or less per deciliter (10.0 mmol or less per liter),

In this large, international, randomized trial, we found that **intensive glucose control increased mortality** among adults in the ICU: a blood glucose target of 180 mg or less per deciliter resulted in lower mortality than did a target of 81 to 108 mg per deciliter.
