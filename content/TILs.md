# TILs

(Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytesï¼›TILs)

- Higher levels of TILs present at diagnosis were significantly associated with **decreased distant recurrence** rates in primary TNBC.
- These results confirm our previous data and further support that TILs should be considered as a robust prognostic factor in this BC subtype.
- We also report for the first time an association between **higher levels of TILs and increased trastuzumab benefit** in HER2+ disease.
