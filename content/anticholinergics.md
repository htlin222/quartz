- Benztropine and trihexyphenidyl: Used to counter reduced dopamine levels and relieve symptoms of Parkinson disease [6]
- Oxybutynin and tolterodine: FDA approved for the treatment of urge incontinence and detrusor hyperactivity[6]

- Scopolamine: Used as a prophylactic anti-emetic[8]
- Atropine: Used to dilate pupil during retina visualization and in the treatment of cholinergic toxicity[9]
- Vecuronium and Succinylcholine: Antinicotinic medications used as a neuromuscular blockade in surgeries[6]
- Mecamylamine: Used strictly in research settings as a ganglionic blocker[6]
