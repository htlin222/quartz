â€¢Â Â Â Pearls about glomerular filtration rate (GFR):

-Â Â Â GFR is measured with exogenous substances (inulin or radioisotopes) or estimated with endogenous substances (creatinine or cystatin C)

-Â Â Â In clinical practice, estimated GFR (eGFR) is calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, which has the best accuracy in persons with normal eGFR, or using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. These equations have largely replaced the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

-Â Â Â eGFR is most accurate when a patient is in a steady state (i.e., has a stable sCr). When interpreting eGFR, consider common scenarios that affect the result, such as muscle mass, medication effect (e.g., TMP/SMX), or dynamic states (e.g., early AKI).

-Â Â Â If eGFR accuracy is critical, consider calculating eGFR with cystatin C, a freely filtered molecule that is not affected by muscle mass.
