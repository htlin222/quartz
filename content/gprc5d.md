# gprc5d

GPRC5D, or **G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D**

is a protein that has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Here are the key points about GPRC5D:

## Function

- GPRC5D is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, but its specific function has not been fully determined[1].
- It is a seven-pass transmembrane receptor protein with a short extracellular N-terminal domain[2].

## Expression in Multiple Myeloma

- GPRC5D is highly expressed on malignant plasma cells in MM patients, while its normal tissue expression is limited primarily to the hair follicle[2][4][6].
- The strong and selective expression of GPRC5D in MM cells, similar to the expression pattern of B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), makes it a promising target for MM immunotherapy[3][4].

## GPRC5D as a Target for MM Treatment

- Targeting GPRC5D with immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and bispecific antibodies has shown promising results in early clinical trials for relapsed or refractory MM[2][5][7].
- GPRC5D-targeted CAR T cells have demonstrated high overall response rates and complete response rates, with a low incidence of severe cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity[5].
- These therapies have also shown efficacy in patients who do not respond to or relapse after BCMA-targeted therapy[5].

In summary, GPRC5D is an attractive target for MM immunotherapy due to its selective expression on myeloma cells and the encouraging results from early clinical trials of GPRC5D-targeted CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies[2][4][5][7].
