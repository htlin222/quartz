### Systemic Fungal Infections

â€¢Â Â Â Pathogens:

-Â Â Â See Tables 8.7 and 8.8 for organisms that cause systemic and opportunistic fungal infections

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnostic tests to evaluate for fungal infections:

-Â Â Â **1,3-Beta-D-glucan (BDG):** Tests for a cell-wall polysaccharide that is present in most, but not all, fungi. It is 75â€“85% sensitive and specific for a fungal infection.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Relevant fungi for which it tests include:

â€¢Â Â Â *Candida*

â€¢Â Â Â *Aspergillus*

â€¢Â Â Â *[[Pneumocystis]]*

â€¢Â Â Â *Histoplasma*

â€¢Â Â Â *Coccidioides*

**â€¢**Â Â Â It does not detect mucormycosis (e.g., *Rhizopus* spp. and *Mucor* spp.), *Cryptococcus* spp., and *Blastomyces* spp.

**â€¢**Â Â Â False positives can occur with administration of IVIG, albumin, and some hemodialysis filters

-Â Â Â **Galactomannan:** Tests for a specific component of the cell wall in *Aspergillus*. Sensitivity of ~70% in serum. More sensitive on BAL samples (~80%). Rarely, false positives can occur in patients receiving TPN. Piperacillin/tazobactam causes false positives, but less commonly now due to new formulations of the antibiotic

-Â Â Â **Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg):** Tests for an antigen associated with *Cryptococcus.* The serum test is useful in patients with HIV/AIDS and CD4 counts <100 cells/Î¼L.

**â€¢**Â Â Â If serum CrAg is negative, there is a very low likelihood that the patient has cryptococcal meningitis (especially in HIV, may not be as sensitive in other types of immunocompromise)

**â€¢**Â Â Â If serum CrAg is positive, get an LP to rule out cryptococcal meningitis in all patients

**â€¢**Â Â Â If LP demonstrates crypto meningitis, treatment includes induction therapy with amphotericin B \+ flucytosine, followed by consolidation and maintenance therapy with fluconazole once repeat LP demonstrates clearance of the organism from CSF

-Â Â Â *Histoplasma* **antigen:** Tests for an antigen associated with histoplasmosis. Can be tested off of serum or urine; >90% sensitivity (urine) and 80% sensitivity (serum). Urine *Histoplasma* antigen is very sensitive for disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV infection.

-Â Â Â **Cocci immunofixation and complement fixation:** Used to evaluate for coccidioidomycosis. Different sensitivity/specificity for these tests in blood vs. CSF.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Antifungal agents â€“ see Table 8.24
