# RAISE

## Ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI for metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 3 randomised double-blind study

[Ramucirumab versus placebo in combination with second-line FOLFIRI in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma that progressed during or after first-line therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine (RAISE): a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 study - The Lancet Oncology](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)70127-0/fulltext)

- Design:
  - Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 RAISE trial
  - Randomised (1:1) via a centralised, interactive voice-response system to receive 8 mg/kg intravenous ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI or matching placebo plus FOLFIRI every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or death.
  - Stratified by region, KRAS mutation status, and time to disease progression after starting first-line treatment.
- Number of patients: 1072 patients (536 in each group)
- Patients characteristics: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with disease progression during or within 6 months of the last dose of first-line therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.
- Agent: Ramucirumab
- Treatment line: Second-line FOLFIRI (leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan)
- Trial Name: RAISE trial (NCT01183780)
- Comparison of two groups in a markdown table:

  | Outcome Measures | Ramucirumab + FOLFIRI | Placebo + FOLFIRI |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Median overall survival (months) | 13.3 (95% CI 12.4-14.5) | 11.7 (10.8-12.7) |
  | Hazard ratio | 0.844 95% CI 0.730-0.976 | - |
  | Log-rank p-value | 0.0219 | - |
  | Neutropenia (â‰¥Grade 3) | 203 (38%) | 123 (23%) |
  | Febrile neutropenia incidence | 18 (3%) | 13 (2%) |
  | Hypertension (â‰¥Grade 3) | 59 (11%) | 15 (3%) |
  | Diarrhoea (â‰¥Grade 3) | 57 (11%) | 51 (10%) |
  | Fatigue (â‰¥Grade 3) | 61 (12%) | 41 (8%) |

- TLDR: OS: 13.6

- Other findings in this trial:
  - Survival benefit was consistent across subgroups of patients who received ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI.
- Summary:
The RAISE trial shows that ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI significantly improves overall survival compared to FOLFIRI with placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had disease progression during or within 6 months of the last dose of first-line therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine. The survival benefit was consistent across subgroups of patients who received ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI.
