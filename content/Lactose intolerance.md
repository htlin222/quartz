# Lactose intolerance

* Lactose intolerance - A digestive disorder where the body is unable to properly digest lactose, a type of sugar found in milk and dairy products. This results in symptoms such as bloating, flatulence, discomfort, and diarrhea when lactose is consumed.

* Acquired after gastroenteritis, medical illness, or gastrointestinal surgery - Lactose intolerance can develop as a result of various factors, including gastroenteritis (an inflammation of the stomach and intestines), medical illness (such as celiac disease or Crohn's disease), or gastrointestinal surgery.

* Clinical symptoms - The symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, flatulence (excess gas), discomfort, and diarrhea. These symptoms typically occur within 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming lactose-containing foods.

* Diagnosis - The diagnosis of lactose intolerance can be made through a hydrogen (H+) breath test, which measures the amount of hydrogen in the breath after consuming lactose, or through an empiric lactose-free diet, where the patient eliminates lactose from their diet and symptoms are monitored.

* Treatment - The primary treatment for lactose intolerance is a lactose-free diet, where the patient eliminates lactose from their diet and avoids lactose-containing foods. Lactase tablets, which contain the enzyme lactase, can also be used to help break down lactose in the small intestine. This can help reduce symptoms and improve digestion for some patients.
