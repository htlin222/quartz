# Calcium

## Calcium regulation (Ca**2\+** 8.5–10.5 mg/dL)

•   Physiology: Most calcium is bound to albumin; free ionized calcium is the physiologic active form under control of PTH

-   Calcium levels are affected by albumin and pH

-   Hypoalbuminemia: Total calcium \+ \[(4 - albumin) × 0.8\]

-   High serum pH: Normal total Ca2\+ but ionized Ca2\+ low

•   Hormones/molecules regulating calcium:

-   **PTH:** ↓Ca2\+ or ↓Mg2→ ↑PTH (from chief cells) → Net ↑Ca2\+, ↓PO43–

**•**   Bone: PTH → Ca2\+ and PO43– release from bones

**•**   Kidney: PTH → ↑ Ca2\+ reabsorption (distal tubule) \+ ↓PO43 reabsorption (proximal tubule)

**•**   Gut: PTH → ↑1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D by stimulating 1-α-hydroxylase in kidney → ↑Gut absorption of Ca2\+ \+ PO43

-   **Vitamin D:** D3 from sun, D2 ingested → 25-OH vitamin D in the liver → 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D in kidney. ↑PTH, ↓PO43–, ↓Ca2\+→ ↑ Αctivated vitamin D → Net ↑Ca2\+, ↑PO43–

**•**   Bone: Activated vitamin D → Bone resorption of both Ca2\+ and PO43–

**•**   Gut: Activated vitamin D → Absorption of both Ca2\+ and PO43

-   **Calcitonin:** Parafollicular cells (C cells) of thyroid (relatively minor effect) ↑Ca2\+→ ↑Calcitonin → ↓Bone resorption of Ca2\+. Opposes action of PTH (“tones down Ca2\+”).

##### Hypercalcemia (Ca**2\+** >10.5 mg/dL after correcting for serum albumin)

•   Etiologies: See Table 6.3


**TABLE 6.3** • Evaluation of Hypercalcemia




•   Clinical features: “Stones, bones, groans, psychiatric overtones”

-   Stones: Nephrolithiasis, nephrogenic DI → [[polyuria]]

-   Bones: Osteopenia, osteitis fibrosa cystica (occurs in severe hyperparathyroidism only)

-   Groans: Abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, pancreatitis

-   Psychiatric overtones: Fatigue, depression, confusion, coma

•   Diagnosis: See Table 6.3

•   Treatment:

-   Address underlying etiology, withhold offending medications

-   Calcium <12 mg/dL corrected:

**•**   If patient asymptomatic, often don’t need immediate treatment but monitor closely. If symptoms of rising calcium, try fluids first.

**•**   If etiology due to hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy is curative in most patients. Refer for surgery; if declined/deferred, can offer cinacalcet or bisphosphonates.

-   Calcium >12 mg/dL corrected:

**•**   Aggressive normal saline repletion (4–6 L/day): Increased urine output = increased renal calcium secretion. Use furosemide cautiously, typically only if evidence of volume overload.

**•**   Calcitonin: Acts rapidly (hours) but tachyphylaxis in 1–2 days so less effective long term

**•**   Bisphosphonates: Slower onset of action (~2 days): Inhibits osteoclasts. Caution in renal failure.

**•**   Consider hemodialysis for rapid calcium correction if Ca2\+ >18 mg/dL

**•**   Special use therapies: Phosphate (may increase risk of calciphylaxis), glucocorticoids (certain malignancies, vitamin D excess, sarcoidosis)

##### Hypocalcemia (Ca**2\+** <7.0 mg/dL after correcting for serum albumin)

•   Etiologies: See Table 6.4


**TABLE 6.4** • Hypocalcemia Workup




•   Clinical features:

-   Seizures, muscle spasms (tetany)

-   Trousseau’s sign (inflate BP cuff → carpal spasm)

-   Chvostek’s sign (tap facial nerve → contraction facial muscles)

-   Hypotension

-   Long QT

-   Renal osteodystrophy (from secondary hyperparathyroidism)

•   Diagnosis: See Table 6.4

•   Treatment:

-   Correct the underlying etiology

-   Replete calcium:

**•**   If severe/symptomatic or acute: IV calcium gluconate \+/- calcitriol; replete Mg2\+ if needed

**•**   If mild/asymptomatic: Oral calcium, ensure magnesium and vitamin D repleted if needed

**•**   Chronic renal failure: Oral calcium, phosphate binder, calcitriol
