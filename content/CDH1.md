# CDH1

- CDH1 is a risk gene for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.
- Families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer meeting certain criteria are recommended for genetic testing, and carriers of pathogenic variants in CDH1 are considered for prophylactic gastrectomy.
- We recently found that germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the homologous-recombination7 genes substantially increased the risk of gastric cancer.
- It has also been suggested that other cancer-predisposing genes, such as mismatch-repair genes,7 are associated with the risk of gastric cancer.
owever, with the exception of CDH1, the identification of variants in these genes are not included in screening recommendations.9
