### Stomach

##### Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)

•   Pathophysiology: Ulcers that develop in the stomach or duodenum. Common risk factors include *H. pylori* infection, NSAID use

•   Clinical features: Asymptomatic (70%), abdominal pain, bleeding. Features differ based on the ulcer location:

-   Gastric ulcer: NSAIDs, *H. pylori*, high malignant potential (*always biopsy\!*), eating does NOT help

-   Duodenal ulcer: *H. pylori* 90%, low malignant potential (don’t need biopsy), eating relieves pain

•   Diagnosis:

-   Endoscopy: Low-risk gastric ulcers (e.g., young person on NSAIDs) and duodenal ulcers do not typically require follow-up; high-risk patients (including gastric ulcers with inadequate-quality biopsy) require repeat endoscopy in 8–12 weeks

-   *H. pylori* testing:

**•**   *H. pylori* IgG antibody test: Positive if any prior exposure (i.e., cannot differentiate active vs. prior infection); however, a negative result is very helpful. Highest-yield clinical use is if never tested or treated before and high pre-test probability for infection; no role if known prior *H. pylori* infection.

**•**   Urea breath test: Identifies active infection. Costly. Used to confirm infection if pre-test probability low, to confirm eradication (eradication should be confirmed for *all* patients, approximately 4 weeks after treatment), or to assess for reinfection. Less accurate in patients taking a PPI, bismuth, or antibiotics, or during active PUD bleeding.

**•**   Fecal antigen test: Identifies active infection. Less expensive. Used to confirm infection if pre-test probability low, to confirm eradication (eradication should be confirmed for *all* patients, approximately 4 weeks after treatment), or to assess for reinfection. Less accurate in patients taking a PPI, bismuth, or antibiotics; the impact on accuracy of active bleeding may depend on the assay used.

**•**   EGD with biopsy: Gold standard, identifies active infection. Less accurate in patients taking a PPI, bismuth, or antibiotics, or during active UGIB.

•   Treatment:

-   Supportive care: Stop ASA, NSAIDs, restrict alcohol use, smoking cessation

-   Acid suppression: PPIs (first line; more rapid at promoting ulcer healing); H2 blockers, antacids

-   Eradicate *H. pylori,* if present. Guidelines now recommend triple therapy only in regions where *H. pylori* clarithromycin resistance is known to be <15% and in patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure. Quadruple therapy is an appropriate first-line treatment, and the paradigm is shifting toward quadruple therapy as first line for most patients due to resistance.

**•**   Triple therapy: PPI BID \+ clarithromycin 500 mg BID \+ amoxicillin 1000 mg BID *or* metronidazole 500 mg BID for 14 days

**•**   Quadruple therapy: PPI BID \+ bismuth 420 mg QID \+ metronidazole 500 mg QID \+ tetracycline 500 mg QID for 10–14 days

•   Key association: *H. pylori* infection is also associated with gastric MALT lymphoma. First-line treatment is *H. pylori* treatment, followed by serial endoscopies.

##### Gastritis

•   Atrophic gastritis: Two forms 1) *H. pylori* associated (treat *H. pylori*); 2) Autoimmune (not curable; can lead to pernicious anemia requiring lifelong vitamin B12 replacement).

•   Metaplasia (chronic) atrophic gastritis: Precancerous lesion of the gastric mucosa associated with *H. pylori*. Treat *H. pylori*. Risk factor for adenocarcinoma; unclear if *H. pylori* eradication can affect the natural history of gastric intestinal metaplasia/progression to gastric cancer.

•   Eosinophilic gastritis/gastroenteritis: Rare inflammatory disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the stomach and/or duodenum (most commonly). Treatment: Elimination diet, steroids.

•   Lymphocytic gastritis: Rare, benign, chronic inflammatory condition, associated with *H. pylori* and Celiac disease. Treat *H. pylori.*

##### Gastroparesis

•   Clinical features: Delayed stomach emptying; early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea/vomiting, pain, bloating, weight loss

•   Diagnosis: Perform EGD and upper GI barium radiography first to rule out an obstruction. Then perform a gastric emptying study while off all medications that can affect motility (e.g., opiates). Evaluate for the cause of gastroparesis with work-up such as: HgA1c, TSH, \+/− ANA or additional testing for neuroautonomic etiologies based on the clinical context.

•   Treatment: Dietary changes, diabetes control, metoclopramide (side effects: parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia), erythromycin, prucalopride (off-label). For refractory symptoms, consider PEG placement for decompression and feeding or gastric pacemaker for diabetic gastroparesis.

##### Gastric outlet obstruction

•   Pathophysiology: Obstruction of the gastric outlet by malignancy, PUD, strictures, caustic injury

•   Clinical features: Nausea/vomiting, epigastric pain, early satiety; “succussion splash” on physical exam

•   Diagnosis: EGD to diagnose and identify cause

•   Treatment: Depends on the cause of obstruction; sometimes need nasogastric tube placement, PPI, endoscopic dilation, stenting or surgery

##### Bariatric surgery

•   Indication: Can be offered to patients with an elevated BMI (typically >35) despite diet/exercise and lifestyle interventions

•   Procedure: Surgical procedure. There are several different types/approaches.

•   Potential complications:

-   Restrictive complications: Band slippage, staple-line leakage

-   Malabsorptive complications: Cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis (due to increased urine oxalate excretion), dumping syndrome, short bowel syndrome, SBO, fistulas, stricture

-   Nutritional complications: Micronutrient deficiencies

-   Bleeding-related complications: Marginal ulcers
