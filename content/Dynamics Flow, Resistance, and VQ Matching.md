# Dynamics Flow, Resistance, and VQ Matching #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Dynamics: Flow, Resistance, and V/Q Matching

â€¢Â Â Â Flow:

-Â Â Â **Ohmâ€™s Law (Î”P = Q Ã— R)**

*P* = *pressure, Q* = *flow, R* = *resistance*

**â€¢**Â Â Â Laminar flow: Î”Q proportional to Î”P (peripheral airway). Reynoldâ€™s \# < 2000.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Turbulent flow: Î”Q proportional to âˆšÎ”P (central airway). Reynoldâ€™s \# >2000.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Reduce density of gas â†’ favors turbulent over laminar flow â†’ decrease work of breathing

-Â Â Â **Breathing cycle**

**â€¢**Â Â Â At rest: Lung collapsing forces = Chest wall expanding forces; Intra-alveolar pressure = 0 cm H2O (i.e., equal to atmospheric pressure); pleural pressure negative (âˆ’5 cm H2O); Transmural pressure positive (\+5 cm H2O); Lung volume = FRC.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Inspiration: Inspiratory muscles contract â†’ Thoracic volume increases â†’ Intra-alveolar pressure <0 cm H2O (i.e., becomes lower than atmospheric pressure) â†’ Air flows in â†’ Intrapleural pressure becomes more negative; Lung volume = FRC \+ TV.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Expiration (passive): Elastic forces of lungs compress greater volume of air in alveoli â†’ Alveolar pressure > atmospheric pressure â†’ Air flows out â†’ Intrapleural pressure returns to baseline (âˆ’5 cm H2O)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Forced expiration: Similar to passive expiration, except use of musculature (abdominal wall, internal intercostals) results in even more positive intrapleural pressure, which rapidly forces air out of the lungs

â€¢Â Â Â Resistance/Poiseuilleâ€™s Law: **R = 8Î·l/Ï€r4**

R = Resistance to flow, Î· = *viscosity of gas*, *l* = *length of airway*, *r* = *radius of airway*

-Â Â Â Medium-sized airways = Highest resistance (small-sized bronchi exist in parallel, so less resistance)

-Â Â Â Resistance influenced by:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Modification of airway radius via bronchial smooth muscle

-Â Â Â Sympathetic stimulation: Î²2 receptors â†’ smooth muscle relaxation â†’ airway dilation â†’ decreased resistance (e.g., Î²2-agonist inhalers)

-Â Â Â Parasympathetic stimulation: Smooth muscle contraction â†’ airway constriction â†’ increased resistance (e.g., anticholinergic toxicity)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Modification of airway radius by lung volume

-Â Â Â High volume = more traction holding airways open, thus decreased resistance (and vice versa)

â€¢Â Â Â V/Q Matching:

-Â Â Â **Calculating ventilation**

**â€¢**Â Â Â Minute ventilation = Tidal volume Ã— breaths/min

**â€¢**Â Â Â Alveolar ventilation = (Tidal volume â€“ dead space) Ã— breaths/min

-Â Â Â **Dead space:** Ventilation but no perfusion (Figure 2.5)



**FIGURE 2.5: Dead space and shunt.** Dead space refers to areas that are ventilated but not perfused, whereas shunt refers to areas that are perfused but not ventilated. V = ventilation; Q = blood flow.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Types of dead space:

-Â Â Â Anatomic dead space: Volume of the conducting airways (i.e., areas that move air but do not participate in gas exchange; ~150 mL)

-Â Â Â Physiologic dead space: Functional measurement of the volume of the lungs that does not participate in gas exchange

â€¢Â Â Â Calculating physiologic dead space: **VD = VT Ã— (PACO2 â€“ PECO2)/(PACO2)**

-Â Â Â VD = Physiologic dead space, VT = Tidal volume, PACO2 = PCO2 of arterial blood = PCO2 of alveolar gas, PECO2 = PCO2 expired air

**â€¢**Â Â Â If physiologic dead space > predicted anatomic dead space, then pathology is present that increases dead space

-Â Â Â E.g., pulmonary embolism â€“ clot disrupts blood flow (i.e., Q = 0) â†’ V/Q = infinity; 100% O2 will help

-Â Â Â **Shunt:** Perfusion but no ventilation (Figure 2.5)

**â€¢**Â Â Â E.g., airway obstruction (i.e., V = 0) â†’ V/Q = 0; 100% O2 does NOT help

-Â Â Â **V/Q mismatch is more likely to cause hypoxemia than hypercapnia**

**â€¢**Â Â Â O2 has a sigmoidal hemoglobin binding curve and thus is generally saturated in the alveolarâ€“capillary bed (i.e., exchange only increases with increased blood flow) â†’ hyperventilating does not help

**â€¢**Â Â Â CO2 has a linear hemoglobin binding curve, and increased ventilation can increase removal from blood â†’ hyperventilating can help/compensate for mismatch
