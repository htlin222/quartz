# FinHER trial

1. Design: Prospective-retrospective study.
2. Number of patients: 1010 early-stage breast cancer patients were enrolled in the FinHER adjuvant, phase III trial, with 778 patients having HER2-nonamplified disease and 232 patients having HER2+ disease.
3. Patients characteristics: Patients with early-stage breast cancer, including both triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+ disease.
4. Agent: Trastuzumab.
5. Treatment line: Adjuvant therapy after surgery, with patients randomized to 9 weeks of trastuzumab or no trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy.
6. Trial Name/NCT Number: FinHER adjuvant, phase III trial, not reported.
7. Comparison of two groups in a markdown table:

| Group/Outcome | TNBC | HER2+ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Association between TILs and distant recurrence | Each 10% increase in TILs was significantly associated with decreased distant recurrence (hazard ratio adjusted for clinicopathological factors: 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.98, P = 0.02) | Each 10% increase in TILs was significantly associated with decreased distant recurrence in patients randomized to the trastuzumab arm (DDFS Pinteraction = 0.025) |
| Trastuzumab benefit | Not reported | Higher levels of TILs were associated with increased trastuzumab benefit. |
| Primary end point | Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) | Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) |
