# epidemiology_of_anal_cancer

- Estimated 9,090 new cases & 1,430 deaths in 2021 (American Cancer Society)
- Increasing incidence (1.9-fold for men, 1.5 for women) from 1970s to 2000s
- association with
  - HPV,
  - receptive anal intercourse,
  - MSM,
  - STD,
  - cervical/vulvovaginal CA,
  - immunosuppression (transplant or HIV),
  - hematologic malignancy,
  - AI d/os,
  - smoking
- HPV (dsDNA nonenveloped virus) is the #1 causative agent; 
    - HPV DNA detected in 84% of specimens (commonly HPV-16, HPV-18)
- HPV prevalence is â†‘ in MSM pop 
    - (detectable in 1/3 of HIV+ men & 1/8 of HIVâˆ’ men)
- HAART â†‘ HIV-assoc survival 
    - but does not impact progression of anal CA. 
    - This contributes to recent â†‘ in anal CA incidence from 19 â†’ 78/100k among HIV+ pts
- [[hpv_vaccination.md|HPV vaccination]] likely to be effective (NEJM 2011;365:1576)
- High-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL) can be a precursor lesion
- Evidence for screening & tx of HSIL (vs. observation) is limited
