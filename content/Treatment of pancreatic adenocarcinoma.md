# Treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma

(Lancet 2016;388:73)

- Resectable: pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) + adjuvant chemo:
  modified FOLFIRINOX (5-FU + leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) if ECOG 0-1
  (NEJM 2018;379:2395), o/w gemcitabine + capecitabine (Lancet 2017;389:1011). Gemcitabine
  monoRx recently standard, but now w/ â†“ role. Role of RT is controversial.
- Borderline: goal to â†“ tumor to allow complete resection (R0 â€“ neg margin at histology) using neoadjuvant Rx (various approaches tested). General schema: chemo Â± RT â†’ restage & potential resection depending on response. May need vasc. reconstruction during resection. Regimens include: FOLFIRINOX; gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel.
- Locally advanced (ie, unresectable): Rx is typically palliative. However, in highly select Pts recent trend toward Rx w/ FOLFIRINOX plus XRT followed by laparotomy for response assessment (imaging can be unreliable) and potential resection.
- Metastatic: clinical trials preferred; Rx based on performance status (PS)
  Good PS: FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (NEJM 2013;369:1691); germline BRCA1/2 mut: maintenance olaparib (NEJM 2019;381:317) also â†‘ response to platinum combination chemo (eg, cisplatin w/ gemcitabine), ICI for MSI-high.
  Poor PS: gemcitabine; capecitabine; continuous infusion 5-FU
- Palliative care: Biliary/gastric outlet obstruct.: endoscopic stenting, IR drain, surg bypass. Pain: opiates, celiac plexus neurolysis, XRT. Wt loss: enzyme replacement.

- **FOLFIRINOX** = 5-FU/LV, irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin
- **nab-P** = [[nab-paclitaxel.md|nab-paclitaxel]]
- Except for CapeOx, all regimens were compared to GEM (Gemcitabine) in randomized phase II or III studies.
