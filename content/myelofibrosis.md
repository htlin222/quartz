[[hematology]]

- from [[primary myelofibrosis (PMF)]]

---

## Epidemiology

- Prevalence of 16‚Äì18,500 people in the United States
- Median age of onset mid-60s
- Includes 1¬∞ MF as well as post-PV & post-ET MF

## Signs and symptoms

- Systemic sxs: Fatigue, fevers, night sweats, wt loss, pruritus, early satiety
- Organomegaly: Hepatomegaly & splenomegaly (may be massive)

## Physical and laboratory findings

- CBC: Anemia, thrombocytopenia common, thrombocytosis may also be seen early in dz. Leukopenia or leukocytosis may be seen. WBC differential may show left shift
- Other labs: Elevated LDH, alkaline phosphatase, & uric acid common
- Blood smear: Leukoerythroblastosis (nucleated RBCs, dacrocytes, myeloid left shift)
- BMBx: Prefibrotic MF vs. overt MF (2016 WHO classification)

## Differential diagnosis

- Other causes of BM fibrosis: Other myeloid neoplasms, lymphoid neoplasms, metastatic malignancy, infxn, connective tissue disorder (lupus)
- WHO criteria: Requires meeting all three major criteria & at least 1 minor criterion
  - [[who_2016_criteria_for_the_diagnosis_of_prefibrotic_myelofibrosis.md|WHO 2016 Criteria for the Diagnosis of Prefibrotic Myelofibrosis]]
  - [[who_2016_criteria_for_the_diagnosis_of_overt_myelofibrosis.md|WHO 2016 Criteria for the Diagnosis of Overt Myelofibrosis]]

## Genetics

- Driver muts: Majority of pts have mut in one of JAK2 (JAK2 V617F in ‚àº50%, JAK2 exon 12 in ‚àº15%), CALR (‚àº25%), or MPL (‚àº5%). Approx 10% of pts are ‚Äútriple-negative‚Äù & have none of these muts. CALR muts are a/w improved survival relative to other muts
- Muts in ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/2, SRSF2, Ras pathway are a/w worse prog (Leukemia 2013;27(9):1861; Leukemia 2020;34(3):799)

## Disease sequelae

- Transformation to acute leukemia: Occurs in 20% of pts. Carries extremely poor prog w/ median survival of 2.7 mos. Factors a/w transformation include: Blasts ‚â•3%, plt <100, unfav karyotype (see DIPSS)
- Extramedullary hematopoiesis: May occur in areas such as near vertebral column, LNs, & can result in organomegaly, effusions, cord compression
- Thrombotic events: ‚Üë Risk of both arterial & venous thrombotic events
- Bone & joint alterations: May include osteosclerosis, gouty arthritis

## Prognostication

- IPSS: Estimates survival from time of dx (Blood 2009;115:392)
- DIPSS: Can be used at any time DIPSS-plus additionally considers karyotype, transfusion, thrombocytopenia (JCO 2011;29(4):392)
- Molecular IPSS (MIPSS)-70 & MIPSS70-plus include molecular data ie, high-risk muts (ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/2, SRSF2) (JCO 2018;36(4):310)
- Lille system: Based on Hb levels & presence of leukopenia or leukocytosis
