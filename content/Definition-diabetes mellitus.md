# Definition-diabetes mellitus

(Diabetes Care 2022;45:S256)
* HbA1c ≥**6.5**
* fasting **glc ≥126** mg/dL
* glc 2 h after [[OGTT]] ≥200 mg/dL × 2 (for any test) or
* single random glc ≥200 mg/dL w/ classic sx of hyperglycemia;
**all tests equally reasonable** (nb, may be ⊕ on one test but not another);
* OGTT preferred during preg

## Blood glc higher than normal,
* but not frank DM (“prediabetics,” ~40% U.S. population)
## Definition:
* HbA1c **5.7–6.4%** impaired fasting glc (IFG) **100–125 mg/dL**, or **2 h prandial glc 140–199**.
* Preventing progression to DM: diet/exercise (58% ↓), metformin (31% ↓; NEJM 2002;346:393)
* [[Reduction in the Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes with Lifestyle Intervention or Metformin]]


## Explain by ChatGPT

* The first line states that diabetes mellitus is a condition where the blood glucose is higher than normal.
* The second line says that this condition can be caused by impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or 2 hour prandial glucose.
* The third line says that diet and exercise can help prevent this condition from progressing to diabetes mellitus.
* The fourth line says that the study found that lifestyle intervention or metformin can help reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes.

## 窩的英文不太好

* 第一行指出糖尿病是一种血糖高於正常水平的疾病。第二行表示這種情況可能是由空腹血糖 (IFG) 或 2 小時餐時血糖受損引起的。第三行說飲食和運動可以幫助防止這種情況發展為糖尿病。第四行說研究發現生活方式乾預或二甲雙胍有助於降低2型糖尿病的發病率。
