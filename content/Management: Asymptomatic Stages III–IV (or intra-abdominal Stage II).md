# Management: Asymptomatic Stages IIIâ€“IV (or intra-abdominal Stage II)
Observation is recommended for asx pts: serial clinical exams & periodic CT (PET is suspicion of transformation). Optimal timing of scans not determined, tailored to individual pt characteristics
In observed pts, median time to initiation of Rx is ~3.5 y, & ~20% never require Rx
No OS advantage has been demonstrated w/ early initiation of Rx
