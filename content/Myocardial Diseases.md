### Myocardial Diseases

##### Myocarditis

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Inflammation of the myocardium due to a viral infection (e.g., adenovirus, coxsackievirus parvovirus B19, HIV, HHV6), parasitic infection, bacterial infection, autoimmune condition (e.g., SLE, sarcoidosis, poly/dermatomyositis), medications (e.g., sulfonamides, doxorubicin, cocaine), idiopathic

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: May have preceding symptoms depending on the etiology (e.g., URI prior to viral myocarditis). May be asymptomatic or can cause fever, fatigue, chest pain, pericarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias. Often â†‘ESR, CRP

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Supportive care

##### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Hypertrophied and stiff LV due to sarcomere protein abnormality, sometimes due to inherited autosomal dominant mutations

â€¢Â Â Â Problems:

-Â Â Â Structural: Septal hypertrophy obstructs LVOT

-Â Â Â Hemodynamic: Flow acceleration sucks anterior MV leaflet into the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) by the Venturi effect, worsening obstruction and causing MVR

-Â Â Â Ischemic: Supply/demand mismatch given thick/highly contractile heart

-Â Â Â Arrhythmias

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Dyspnea on exertion, angina, syncope after exertion/Valsalva, sudden death

â€¢Â Â Â Heart sound: Sustained PMI, loud S4, rapid carotid upstroke, crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur louder with Valsalva/standing and softer with hand grip

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Requires 1) Appropriate clinical symptoms; 2) Wall thickness >15 mm visualized anywhere in the ventricle; 3) Absence of secondary cause of LVH (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis, infiltrative diseases) **or** if LVH is out of proportion to the stressor

â€¢Â Â Â Suggestive features: Helpful but not required for diagnosis: Septal hypertrophy with or without obstruction (LVOT gradient >30 mmHg at rest); genetic testing

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Decrease LVOT obstruction and improve symptoms; avoid anything that increases contractility or impairs filling (e.g., avoid dehydration, diuretics, isometric exercise, nitrates, dobutamine); give BB or CCB, disopyramide; consider procedures (e.g., myectomy, catheter-based alcohol septal ablation).

-Â Â Â Prevent sudden death: ICD indicated for secondary prevention, or if family history of sudden death, LV wall >30 mm, and/or unexplained syncope.

##### Restrictive cardiomyopathy

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Infiltrative diseases (e.g., amyloid, sarcoid, hemochromatosis), lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Fabry disease), endomyocardial damage (e.g., XRT, fibrosis), scleroderma, carcinoid

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Stiff poorly filling ventricles may cause diastolic dysfunction. Right heart failure is common (because right heart is thin walled, and thus more sensitive to change).

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: ECG: Low voltages; PYP scan for ATTR amyloid; often need cardiac biopsy to diagnose other etiologies

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat underlying disorder; e.g., hemochromatosis (phlebotomy, deferoxamine), sarcoid (steroids), amyloid (chemotherapy for AL amyloid; tafamidis for ATTR amyloid)
