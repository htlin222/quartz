# Evaluation for the presence of heart failure

- CXR (see Radiology insert):
  - pulm edema,
  - pleural effusions ± cardiomegaly,
  - cephalization,
  - Kerley B-lines;
- lung U/S better than CXR (PPV & NPV 92% vs. 77%; Chest 2015;148:202)
- [[BNP and NT-proBNP]] can help exclude HF;
- Evidence of ↓ organ perfusion:
  - ↑ Cr,
  - ↓ Na,
  - abnl LFTs
- Echo (see inserts):
  - ↓ EF & ↑ chamber size → systolic dysfxn; hypertrophy,
  - abnl MV inflow,
  - abnl tissue Doppler → ? diastolic dysfxn; abnl valves or pericardium; ↑ estimated RVSP
- PA catheterization:
  - ↑ PCWP,
  - ↓ CO,
  - and ↑ SVR (in low-output failure)
