# Neurologic Psychologic-complications of HIV AIDS

* Meningitis: Crypto (dx w/ CSF; serum CrAg 90% Se), bacterial (inc. Listeria), viral (HSV, CMV, 1° HIV), TB, histo, Coccidio, lymphoma; neurosyphilis (cranial nerve palsies)
* Space-occupying lesions: may present as HA, focal deficits or Δ MS. Workup: MRI, brain bx only if suspect non-Toxo etiology (Toxo sero ⊖) or no response to 2 wk of empiric anti-Toxo Rx (if Toxo, 50% respond by d3, 91% by d14; NEJM 1993;329:995)
Etiology Imaging Appearance Diagnostic Studies
## Toxoplasmosis
Enhancing lesions, typically in basal ganglia (can be multiple)
⊕ Toxo serology (Se ~85%)
## CNS lymphoma
Enhancing ring lesion (single 60% of the time)
⊕ CSF PCR for EBV
⊕ SPECT or PET scan
## Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Multiple nonenhancing lesions in white matter
⊕ CSF PCR for JC virus
## Other: abscess, nocardiosis, crypto, TB, CMV, HIV
Variable
Biopsy

* HIV-assoc. dementia: depressive sx, impaired attention/concentration, psychomotor slowing
* Depression: ↑ rates of suicide/depression
* Myelopathy: infxn (CMV, HSV), cord compression (epidural abscess, lymphoma)
* Peripheral neuropathy: meds (esp 1st gen NRTIs), CMV, diabetes
