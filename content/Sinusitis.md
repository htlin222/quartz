# Sinusitis #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Sinusitis

â€¢Â Â Â **Physical exam**: Palpate the sinuses (frontal, ethmoid, maxillary); inspect the oropharynx and nasal cavities; perform a cranial nerve exam

â€¢Â Â Â **Differential diagnosis:**

-Â Â Â **Viral rhinosinusitis**

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Most common cause of sinusitis

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Nasal congestion, sore throat

â€¢Â Â Â Physical exam: Patients are less sick and lack findings associated with bacterial infection

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis (no specific labs/imaging required)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Supportive care, no antibiotics indicated

-Â Â Â **Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis:** *S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae*

â€¢Â Â Â Symptoms: Facial pain/pressure/fullness, purulent nasal drainage, nasal congestion, fever

â€¢Â Â Â Physical exam: Pain with palpation of the facial sinus, nasal turbinate edema, purulent drainage in the nasal cavity/posterior pharynx

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis (no specific labs/imaging required) based on:

-Â Â Â Persistent symptoms >10 days, especially if severe/worsening symptoms >3 days; OR

-Â Â Â Initial improvement followed by worsening of symptoms

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Consider observation for patients who are immunocompetent and have good follow-up; amoxicillin-clavulanate BID (typically not amoxicillin due to increasing resistance of *S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae*) for 5â€“7 days

â€¢Â Â Â Complications:

-Â Â Â Chronic rhinosinusitis: Symptoms that last >12 weeks. Obtain CT scan and refer to ENT.

-Â Â Â Orbital cellulitis: Pain with extraocular movement of the eyes, diplopia, opthalmoplegia. Urgent management required.

-Â Â Â Cavernous sinus thrombosis: New headache, focal neurologic findings. Urgent imaging and intervention required.
