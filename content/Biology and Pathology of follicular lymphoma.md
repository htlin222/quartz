# Biology and Pathology of follicular lymphoma

- Composed primarily of small, cleaved lymphocytes that grow in a follicular pattern resembling that of nl 2Â° lymphoid tissue
- Variable numbers of larger centroblasts, w/ â†‘ number indicating higher grade
- Grade I, II, & IIIA share the tx paradigm outlined below. Grade IIIB is â†’ treated as DLBCL
- Immunophenotypically, FL cells classically express the B-cell Ags CD19 & CD20, the _follicular center Ags CD10 & BCL-6_, & the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2. Does not express T-cell Ags, including CD3 or CD5 (latter is â†’ typically expressed in CLL/SLL or MCL)
- Overexpression of [[BCL-2]],
- As w/ other lymphomas, incisional or excisional bx is â†’ preferred for initial dx
- The term [[follicular center cell lymphoma]] is â†’ nonspecific & may refer to FL or DLBCL
- Testicular FL, duodenal-type FL, pediatric FL, & 1Â° cutaneous follicle center lymphoma are rare, distinct dzs & are managed differently than classic FL
