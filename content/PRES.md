# PRES

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
## characterized by
headache,
visual disturbances
seizures
altered mental states.

In hypertensive- related PRES cases, severe hypertension breaks down the blood-brain barrier (BBB), impairing cerebrovascular autoregulation, and causing the subsequent development of interstitial brain edema, predominantly involving bilateral parieto-occipital regions. After the underlying factor has been controlled, symptoms subside.
