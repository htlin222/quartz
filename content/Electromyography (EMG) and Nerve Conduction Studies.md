â€¢Â Â Â Definitions:

-Â Â Â EMG: Clinical study of electrical activity of muscle fibers

-Â Â Â Nerve conduction study: Clinical study of electrical activity from nerve roots, plexus, peripheral nerves \+/â€“ neuromuscular junction

â€¢Â Â Â Indications:

-Â Â Â Localization of lower motor neuron disorders, including anterior horn, nerve root, plexus, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, or muscle
