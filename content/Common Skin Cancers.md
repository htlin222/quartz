### Common Skin Cancers

##### Benign skin conditions

•   Seborrheic keratosis (SK): Benign pigmented neoplasm; common after age 50 yr; presents as tan-brown “stuck on” papules or plaques. Sudden appearance of multiple SK’s is associated with underlying malignancy (Leser-Trelat sign). Treatment: Cryotherapy or shave removal if symptomatic.

•   Melanocytic nevi (“mole”): Benign neoplasm composed of melanocytes; can occur anywhere on the body and can mimic melanoma. Treatment: Biopsy to rule out melanoma if concerning appearance.

•   Acrochordon (“skin tag”): Skin-colored pedunculated papules on the neck and skin folds; associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Treatment: Cryotherapy or snip excision.

•   Cherry angioma: Benign vascular lesion that presents as a red-violaceous papule

•   Dermatofibroma: Benign fibrohistiocytic lesion; presents as a tan-brown papule that “dimples” with pressure; often on the lower extremities; F>M

##### Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)

•   Epidemiology: Most common skin cancer; due to UV light exposure; rarely metastasizes but can cause significant local tissue destruction

•   Clinical features: Presents as a pearly nodule with arborizing telangiectasias and ulceration (nodular type, most common), a pink-red patch (spreading type), or shiny black-blue papules (pigmented type)

•   Diagnosis: Confirm histologically with biopsy

•   Treatment: Surgical excision (standard versus Mohs), electrodessication and curettage, or topical chemotherapy

##### Actinic keratosis (AK)

•   Definition: Precancerous lesion of the epidermis (<5% progress to squamous cell skin cancer)

•   Clinical features: Presents as pink, scaly, “sandpaper-like” papules and plaques in sun exposed areas

•   Treatment: Cryotherapy, topical 5-FU, imiquimod

##### Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

•   Epidemiology: Second most common skin cancer; risk factors include UV light exposure, radiation, chemicals (coal, soot, arsenic), HPV, and immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplantation).

•   Clinical features: Presents as a pink, scaly papules, plaques, and nodules that ulcerate, bleed, and become crusty; may arise from a chronic wound/scar (Marjolin ulcer)

•   Diagnosis: Confirm histologically with biopsy

•   Treatment: Surgical excision (standard versus Mohs) is first line, radiation if surgery is contraindicated, systemic chemotherapy if metastasis

##### Malignant melanoma

•   Epidemiology: Most deadly skin cancer; histologically aggressive and has a high risk of metastasis; lifetime risk is 1 in 50 individuals

•   Clinical features: **ABCDE** – Asymmetry, **B**order irregularities, **C**olor variation, **D**iameter >6 mm, **E**volution over time

•   Subtypes include:

-   Superficial spreading (~70% of melanomas): Presents as variably pigmented macules with irregular borders; commonly located on the back (men) or posterior legs (women)

-   Nodular (15–30% of melanomas): Presents as darkly pigmented “berry-like” papules or nodules

-   Lentigo maligna (10–15% of melanomas): Presents as atypical pigmented macules, typically in chronically sun-damaged areas in older adults

-   Acral lentiginous (<5% of all melanomas): Most common melanoma among dark-skinned individuals; presents as dark brown macules or patches on the palmar, plantar, and subungual surfaces (e.g., beneath the nail plate)

-   Uveal melanoma: Melanoma of the eye involving the iris, ciliary body, or choroid (collectively referred to as the uvea)

-   Mucosal melanoma: Rare type of melanoma that occurs on mucosal surfaces (e.g., GI tract, GU tract, respiratory tract)

•   Staging: Via TNM system. Based on tumor depth, lymph node involvement, and presence of metastatic spread

•   Prognosis: Poor prognostic factors include: male gender, older age, increased tumor thickness (Breslow depth), ulceration, increased tumor mitotic rate, and tumor location on head/neck

•   Treatment:

-   Stage I–II: Wide local excision, consider sentinel lymph node biopsy if stage IB or higher (e.g., tumor thickness ≥1 mm)

-   Stage III: Wide local excision \+ lymph node dissection \+ adjuvant systemic therapy

-   Stage IV: Systemic immunotherapy (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) or targeted therapy (e.g., BRAF/MEK inhibitors if BRAF V600 mutant)
