# note of Principles of Clinical Pharmacology

* Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are two essential aspects of pharmacology that help to understand how drugs work in the body.

* Pharmacokinetics (PK) refers to what the body does to a drug, which involves absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of the drug. PK studies the drug's behavior in the body, including how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated from the body. PK helps to determine the drug concentration in the blood over time and how long it stays in the body.

* Pharmacodynamics (PD) refers to what the drug does to the body, which involves the drug's effects on its target site in the body, such as receptors, enzymes, or ion channels. PD studies the drug's mechanism of action, including how the drug interacts with its target and how it produces its effects. PD helps to determine the drug's potency, efficacy, and safety.

* In summary, pharmacokinetics focuses on the movement of drugs through the body, while pharmacodynamics focuses on the drug's effects on the body.
