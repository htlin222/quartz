# The Confusion Assessment Method
(CAM) Diagnostic Algorithm

The diagnosis of delirium requires the presence of
- features 1 and 2 and
- either feature 3 or 4.

## Feature 1. Acute Onset and Fluctuating Course
This feature is satisfied by positive responses to the following questions:
- Is there evidence of an acute change in mental status from the patient’s baseline?
- Did the (abnormal) behavior fluctuate during the day, that is,
	- tend to come and go,
	- or did it increase and decrease in severity?

## Feature 2. Inattention
This feature is satisfied by a positive response to the following question:
Did the patient have difficulty focusing attention
	- for example, being easily distractible,
	- or have difficulty keeping track of what was being said?

## Feature 3. Disorganized Thinking
This feature is satisfied by a positive response to the following question:
Was the patient’s thinking disorganized or incoherent,
	- such as rambling or irrelevant conversation,
	- unclear or illogical flow of ideas,
	- or unpredictable switching from subject to subject?

## Feature 4. Altered Level of Consciousness
- This feature is satisfied by any answer other than “alert” to the following question:
- Overall, how would you rate the patient’s level of consciousness:
	- alert (normal)
	- vigilant (hyperalert)
	- lethargic (drowsy, easily aroused)
	- stupor (difficult to arouse)
	- coma (unarousable)?
