# introduction of NSCLC Treatment

- Localized disease: surgery if possible; RT (eg, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy [SABR]) vs. chemo/RT if not (see Figure 5-7)

- Metastatic disease: >20 new Rx since 2015. Some targeted Rx substantially improves survival & are better tolerated (see Stage IV Rx table); however, 5-y survival still poor.
- First-line immunotherapy (IO) ± chemo for most Pts w/o targetable mutations.
- Pemetrexed + pembrolizumab often continued as maintenance when used.
- Palliative care ↑ survival (NEJM 2010;363:733); palliative RT for local sx from tumor/mets.

> 參考 ➡️ [Early palliative care improved quality of life in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/0003-4819-153-12-201012210-02003)

- Avoid **combining IO & targeted Rx**, ↑↑ tox (eg, rash/diarrhea, lung/liver injury [can be fatal])

- Solitary brain metastasis (oligomet): surgical resection + brain radiation may ↑ survival
