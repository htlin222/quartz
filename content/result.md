RESULTS
At the first interim analysis, among the first 602 patients who underwent randomization, the percentage of patients with a pathological complete response was 64.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.9 to 69.5) in the pembrolizumab窶田hemotherapy group and 51.2% (95% CI, 44.1 to 58.3) in the placebo窶田hemotherapy group (estimated treatment difference, 13.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.4 to 21.8; P<0.001). After a median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 2.7 to 25.0), 58 of 784 patients (7.4%) in the pembrolizumab窶田hemotherapy group and 46 of 390 patients (11.8%) in the placebo窶田hemotherapy group had disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, had local or distant recurrence or a second primary tumor, or died from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.93). Across all treatment phases, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 78.0% in the pembrolizumab窶田hemotherapy group and 73.0% in the placebo窶田hemotherapy group, including death in 0.4% (3 patients) and 0.3% (1 patient), respectively.
