# BIPSS

bilat. Inferior petrosal é¡³éª¨å²©éƒ¨ sinus vein sampling;
âœ“ petrosal:peripheral ACTH ratio (âŠ• â‰¥2 basal, â‰¥3 after CRH)

## ddx: pituitary or ectopic origin
with a sensitivity and specificity of 88â€“100% and 67â€“100%, respectively.

[[Rationale of BIPSS]]

In the setting of hypercortisolemia, ACTH levels obtained from venous drainage of the pituitary are expected to be higher than the levels of peripheral blood, thus suggesting pituitary ACTH excess as the cause of hypercortisolism.
Direct stimulation of the pituitary corticotroph with corticotrophin-releasing hormone enhances the sensitivity of the procedure.
The procedure must be undertaken in the presence of hypercortisolemia, which suppresses both the basal and stimulated secretory activity of normal corticotrophic cells: ACTH measured in the sinus is, therefore, the result of the secretory activity of the tumor tissue.
The poor accuracy in lateralization of BIPSS (positive predictive value of 50â€“70%) makes interpetrosal ACTH gradient alone not sufficient for the localization of the tumor.
An accurate exploration of the gland is recommended if a tumor is not found in the predicted area.
Despite the fact that BIPSS is an invasive procedure, the occurrence of adverse events is extremely rare, particularly if it is performed by experienced operators in referral centres.
