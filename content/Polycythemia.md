### Polycythemia

•   Definition: High hemoglobin (Hbg >16.5 g/dL in men, Hbg >16 g/dL in women)

•   Clinical features: “Ruddy” complexion, hyperviscosity (if severe, can cause chest pain, headache, blurred vision, parasthesias, thrombosis)

•   Diagnosis: Check EPO level to differentiate primary vs. secondary

•   Differential diagnosis:

-   Primary (normal EPO): Polycythemia vera (see myeloproliferative neoplasms)

-   Secondary (↑EPO):

**•**   Chronic hypoxia (body responds to increase oxygen carrying capacity by producing more RBCs): COPD, OSA, heart failure, carbon monoxide exposure

**•**   Tumor-associated: Some tumors can produce EPO (e.g., RCC, HCC)

•   Treatment: Treat underlying cause
