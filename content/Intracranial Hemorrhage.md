### Intracranial Hemorrhage

##### Epidural hematoma

•   Etiology: Rupture middle meningeal artery due to head trauma. Can have periods of unresponsiveness with interval lucidity; CSF is often yellow because bilirubin is present (xanthochromia)

•   NCHCT: Convex, lens-shaped hematoma that respects suture lines

•   Treatment: Reverse coagulopathy, consult neurosurgery, craniotomy may be indicated

##### Subdural hematoma (SDH)

Acute subdural

•   Etiology: Head trauma resulting in injury to small bridging veins

•   NCHCT: Crescent shaped hematoma that crosses suture lines

•   Treatment: Reverse coagulopathy, consult neurosurgery, craniotomy may be indicated

Chronic subdural

•   Etiology: Typically occurs in elderly patients or patients on anticoagulation who have mild head trauma

•   NCHCT: Crescent-shaped hematoma

•   Treatment: Reverse coagulopathy, consult neurosurgery, can sometimes observe or may need craniotomy

##### Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)

•   Etiology: Ruptured aneurysm or due to an AV malformation (e.g., in the setting of Marfan’s syndrome, ADPKD), trauma, arterial dissection

•   Symptoms: “Worst headache of my life,” meningismus, focal neurologic deficits, encephalopathy, seizure

•   Diagnosis: NCHCT, LP needed to definitely rule out if head imaging is negative

•   Treatment: Reverse coagulopathy, consult neurosurgery, maintain SBP goal <140 mmHg, nimodipine, clip or coil aneurysm

•   Complications: Rebleed (highest risk during the first 24 hr), vasospasm (highest risk 3–14 days after SAH), hydrocephalus, seizures, hyponatremia (SIADH)

##### Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)

•   Etiology: Intraparenchymal bleed, which is most often due to hypertension

•   Symptoms: Focal neurologic symptoms and then signs of ↑ICP (somnolence, vomiting, headache, bradycardia, hypertension, coma)

•   Diagnosis: CT angiogram, repeat NCHCT at 6 hours

•   Treatment: Reverse coagulopathy, consult neurosurgery, maintain SBP < 160 mmHg
