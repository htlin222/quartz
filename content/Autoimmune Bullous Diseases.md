### Autoimmune Bullous Diseases

##### Bullous pemphigoid (BP)

•   Pathophysiology: Chronic autoimmune blistering disease most commonly seen in the elderly due to autoantibodies targeting hemidesmosomes in the basement membrane, resulting in sub-epidermal blistering (“bullow”).

•   Clinical features: Pruritic plaques and urticarial lesions with tense, intact blisters on the thighs and flexural areas

•   Histology: Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) shows linear IgG deposition at the basement membrane zone

•   Treatment: Topical high-potency glucocorticoids, oral steroids, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil

##### Pemphigus vulgaris

•   Pathophysiology: Rare autoimmune blistering disease with mucocutaneous involvement due to autoantibodies targeting desmoglein proteins in the epidermis, resulting in suprabasal (interepidermal) blistering.

•   Clinical features: Flaccid blisters that easily rupture (\+Nikolsky sign) leaving painful, bright red erosions; most patients have oral involvement but can also see esophageal, urethral, vulvovaginal, and penile lesions

•   Histology: DIF shows intracellular IgG deposition; may also see “tombstones” of basal cells attached to the basement membrane

•   Treatment: Systemic steroids, azathioprine, or mycophenolate, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab for severe disease

##### Dermatitis herpetiformis

•   Pathophysiology: Autoimmune blistering disease due to IgA autoantibodies targeting epidermal tissue transglutaminase; >90% of patients have gluten insensitivity

•   Clinical features: Presents with severe pruritus and excoriated papulovesicles on the extensor surfaces (elbows, knees)

•   Treatment: Gluten avoidance, dapsone
