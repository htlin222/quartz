### Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (aka “Biologics” or Biologic DMARDs)

•   Definition: DMARDs that work by targeting immune system pathways

•   General principles of use:

-   Screen for chronic infections prior to starting biologic DMARD therapy: Tuberculosis (PPD or IGRA), HepB, HepC, HIV

-   Biologic DMARD administration: Subcutaneous medications can be self-administered; IV medications are administered at an infusion center

-   Lab monitoring: Check CBC/CMP q2–3 months to evaluate for cytopenias and check renal/hepatic function

-   Do not administer live vaccines while on biologics, including live influenza vaccine, Zostavax (→ use Shingrix instead), yellow fever vaccine

-   Nomenclature: See Table 9.15 for structure-suffix relationships for therapeutic antibodies


**TABLE 9.15** • Structure-Suffix Relationship of Therapeutic Antibodies





**TABLE 9.16** • Non-Biologic DMARDs





**TABLE 9.17** • Biologic DMARDs




•   Medications: See Table 9.17
