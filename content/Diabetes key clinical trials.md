### Diabetes

â€¢Â Â Â **Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT).** *N Engl J Med* 1993;329(14):977â€“986. Follow-up: *N Engl J Med* 2000;342(6):381â€“389.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized controlled trial that randomized 1441 patients with type 1 diabetes to intensive vs. conventional glycemic control therapy. Patients who kept their blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible with intensive diabetes treatment as early as possible in their disease had fewer diabetes-related health problems after 6.5 yr (including diabetic retinopathy, development of kidney and cardiovascular disease), compared to patients who used conventional treatment. Long-term follow-up of these patients demonstrated that these benefits persisted. After 30 yr of follow-up, the group that had tightly controlled blood glucoses in the study had a 32% reduction in major cardiovascular events, suggesting that better control early in DM1 can prevent cardiovascular disease.

â€¢Â Â Â **UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS).** *Lancet* 1998;352:837â€“853. Follow up: **Holman et al.** *N Engl J Med* 2008;359(15):1577â€“1589.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized controlled trial that randomized 3867 patients with newly diagnosed DM2 to intensive vs. lenient glycemic control therapy. A follow-up study 10 yr later found that the intensive glucose control group had a lower risk of MIs and death from any cause. Patients who underwent intensive glycemic control (fasting glucose <108 mg/dL) had a 25% reduction in microvascular complications, but there was no effect on macrovascular disease or mortality between treatment groups.

â€¢Â Â Â **Nice-Sugar Study**. *N Engl J Med* 2009;360(13):1283â€“1297.

-Â Â Â Multicenter, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial that randomized 6104 patients with diabetes who had been admitted to an intensive care unit and were expected to stay at least 3 days to intensive glucose control (goal glucose 80â€“108 mg/dL) vs. liberal glucose control (<180 mg/dL). Intensive glucose control led to more deaths than the conventional approach, suggesting more permissive glucose control with glucose <180 mg/dL is preferred in the ICU setting.
