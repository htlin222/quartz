# Diagnostic evaluation of thrombocytopenia

- H&P: meds, infxns, underlying conditions, splenomegaly, lymph nodes, bleeding hx
- CBC with differential: isolated thrombocytopenia vs. multilineage involvement

## Peripheral smear

- (r/o pseudothrombocytopenia due to platelet clumping)
- ↑ destruction → look for large plts, ↑ MPV, schistocytes (see “Peripheral Smear” inserts)
- ↓ production → rarely limited to platelets → look for blasts, hypersegmented PMNs, leukoerythroblastic Δs; can see inclusion bodies (anaplasma), parasites (Babesia)

## Additional laboratory evaluations as indicated

- (eg, viral titers, flow cytometry, ANA, APLA)
- if anemia: ✓ reticulocyte count, LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin to detect hemolysis
- if hemolytic anemia: ✓ PT, PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, Coombs, ANA
- BM bx for unexplained thrombocytopenia, esp. if associated with splenomegaly
