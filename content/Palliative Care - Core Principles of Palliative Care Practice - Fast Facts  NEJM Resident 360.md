# Palliative Care - Core Principles of Palliative Care Practice - Fast Facts | NEJM Resident 360
**Interdisciplinary care:** Palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team that includes physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, pharmacists, and others. The interdisciplinary team strengthens whole-person care for patients with serious illness.

**Integrative model of palliative care:** Palliative care is provided along the continuum of a patient’s illness and alongside curative or life-prolonging care. At the time of diagnosis, palliative care may have a more limited role. Over the course of a patient’s illness, palliative care needs often increase. Late in the disease trajectory, palliative care may be the primary focus of care. After a patient’s death, bereavement support continues for surviving family and friends.

This model of the continuum for palliative and hospice care is depicted in the following figure:
