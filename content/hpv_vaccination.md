### Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine (qHPV) for Prevention of Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia in Men Who Have Sex with Men

**Information**

- **Design**: Double-blind, randomized substudy
- **Number of patients**: 602 healthy men who have sex with men, 16 to 26 years of age
- **Agent**: Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (qHPV)
- **Endpoints**:
  - Primary: Prevention of anal intraepithelial neoplasia or anal cancer related to infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18
  - Secondary: Rates of adverse events
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: NCT00090285

**Results**

- **Efficacy**:
  - Intention-to-treat population: 50.3% (95% CI, 25.7 to 67.2) against anal intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18
  - Per-protocol efficacy population: 77.5% (95% CI, 39.6 to 93.3) against anal intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18
- **Rates of anal intraepithelial neoplasia**:
  - Intention-to-treat population: 17.5 per 100 person-years in the placebo group, 13.0 per 100 person-years in the vaccine group
  - Per-protocol efficacy population: 8.9 per 100 person-years in the placebo group, 4.0 per 100 person-years in the vaccine group
- **Grade 2 or 3 anal intraepithelial neoplasia**:
  - Intention-to-treat population: Reduced by 54.2% (95% CI, 18.0 to 75.3)
  - Per-protocol efficacy population: Reduced by 74.9% (95% CI, 8.8 to 95.4)
- **Persistent anal infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18**:
  - Intention-to-treat population: Reduced by 59.4% (95% CI, 43.0 to 71.4)
  - Per-protocol efficacy population: Reduced by 94.9% (95% CI, 80.4 to 99.4)
- **Safety**: No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.

**Summary**
The quadrivalent HPV vaccine (qHPV) was found to be effective in reducing the rates of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, including grade 2 or 3, among men who have sex with men. The vaccine had a favorable safety profile and may help to reduce the risk of anal cancer.
