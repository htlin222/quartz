# cpx-351

CPX-351 is a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin that delivers a synergistic 5:1 drug ratio into leukemia cells to a greater extent than normal bone marrow cells.

## CPX-351 versus 7+3 for Newly Diagnosed Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial

- **Design:** Phase III, open-label, randomized clinical trial
- **Number of patients:** 309 patients age 60 to 75 years
- **Patients characteristics:** Newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML)
- **Agent:** CPX-351 or 7+3
- **Treatment line:** One to two induction cycles of CPX-351 or 7+3 followed by consolidation therapy with a similar regimen
- **Trial Name/NCT Number:** Not reported

### Comparison of CPX-351 vs. 7+3

| Endpoints           | CPX-351                          | 7+3                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| OS                  | Median 9.56 months               | Median 5.95 months               |
| Response rate       | Overall remission rate was 47.7% | Overall remission rate was 33.3% |
| Non-hematologic AEs | Comparable between arms          | Comparable between arms          |

- **Other findings:**
  - Early mortality rates with CPX-351 and 7+3 were 5.9% and 10.6% (two-sided P = .149) through day 30 and 13.7% and 21.2% (two-sided P = .097) through day 60.

### Summary

- CPX-351 significantly improved overall survival and response rate compared to 7+3 in older adults with newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML).
- The safety profile of CPX-351 was similar to that of conventional 7+3 therapy, despite a longer treatment phase and prolonged time to neutrophil and platelet count recovery with CPX-351.
- Early mortality rates were lower with CPX-351 compared to 7+3, although the difference was not statistically significant.
