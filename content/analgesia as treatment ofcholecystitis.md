# analgesia as treatment ofcholecystitis

Class Summary
Pain is a prominent feature of cholecystitis. The classic teaching is that morphine is not the agent of choice because of the possibility of increasing tone at the sphincter of Oddi. Meperidine has been shown to provide adequate analgesia without affecting the sphincter of Oddi and, therefore, is the drug of choice.
