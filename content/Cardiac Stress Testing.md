### Cardiac Stress Testing

â€¢Â Â Â Indications:

-Â Â Â Assessment for a new diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with chest pain who have been ruled out for acute coronary syndrome (ACS)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Helpful in patients who have INTERMEDIATE pre-test probability of CAD (Table 1.3)


**TABLE 1.3 â€¢ Pre-Test Probability of CAD Based on Age and Features of Chest Pain**




-Â Â Â If low pre-test probability of CAD, stress testing is not specific enough (positive results are often *false* positives)

-Â Â Â If high pre-test probability of CAD, stress testing is not sensitive enough (negative results are often *false* negatives); instead proceed to coronary angiogram, which is more sensitive/specific

**â€¢**Â Â Â Chest pain quality and age together determine the probability of underlying CAD (Table 1.3)

-Â Â Â Features of chest pain concerning for CAD:

â€¢Â Â Â Substernal location

â€¢Â Â Â Provoked by exertion or emotion

â€¢Â Â Â Improved by rest or with nitroglycerin

-Â Â Â All features = Typical angina; 2â€“3 features = atypical angina; 0â€“1 features = nonanginal

**â€¢**Â Â Â Also adjust assessment of CAD risk using the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Calculator and additional factors:

-Â Â Â Very high risk: History of MI, stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease

-Â Â Â High risk: Familial hypercholesterolemia, prior CABG or PCI, DM, HTN, CKD (eGFR 15â€“59), current smoker, LDL-C persistently â‰¥100 mg/dL despite treatment, heart failure

-Â Â Â Other risk enhancers: Low HDL, LDL >160 mg/dL, family history of premature ASCVD (<55 yr in male first degree relative; <65 yr in female first degree relative), metabolic syndrome (TG >150 mg/dL, HTN, DM, low HDL-C, increased weight circumference), inflammatory conditions (especially RA, psoriasis, HIV), menopause before 40 yr, pregnancy complications (e.g., preeclampsia), high-risk ethnicity (e.g., South Asian)

â€¢Â Â Â Contraindications: Recent MI or active ACS, decompensated heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmias; severe hypertension may preclude testing or affect the validity of the results

â€¢Â Â Â Pre-stress test patient instructions:

-Â Â Â Instruct patients to take all medications as usual with the exception of beta blockers

-Â Â Â Patients are allowed to eat, but cannot consume caffeine prior to vasodilator testing

â€¢Â Â Â Types of stress tests: Can vary the combination of stressor and detector (Table 1.4)


**TABLE 1.4 â€¢ Types of Cardiac Stress Tests**




-Â Â Â Possible stressors:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Exercise â€“ Treadmill or bike

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pharmacologic â€“ Coronary vasodilators (adenosine derivatives, e.g., regadenoson) or Î²1 agonist (dobutamine)

-Â Â Â Possible detectors:

**â€¢**Â Â Â ECG

**â€¢**Â Â Â ECHO

**â€¢**Â Â Â Nuclear (PET vs. SPECT such as 99m Tc-sestamibi)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Cardiac MR (new technology, only available in select centers)
