- Myocardial ischemia (± Tw abnl)
- Acute true posterior MI:
  - posterior STE appearing as anterior STD (± ↑ R wave) in V1-V3 ✓ posterior ECG leads;
  - manage as a STEMI with rapid reperfusion (see “ACS”)
- Digitalis effect:
  - downsloping ST ± Tw abnl;
  - does not correlate w/ dig levels
- Hypokalemia (± U wave)
- Repolarization abnl a/w LBBB or LVH (usually in leads V5, V6, I, aVL, called “LV strain”)
