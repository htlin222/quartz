# selected cognitive biases contributing to diagnostic errors

[[diagnostic error]]

1. Premature closure: accepting a diagnosis before it has been fully verified

2. Anchoring: tendency to fixate on a specific symptom or piece of information early in the diagnostic process with subsequent failure to appropriately adjust

3. Confirmation bias: tendency to look for confirming evidence to support oneâ€™s diagnostic hypothesis, rather than disconfirming evidence to refute it

4. Search satisficing: tendency to call off a search, satisfied once a piece of data or presumed explanation is found, and not considering/searching for additional findings or diagnoses

5. Availability bias: tendency to give too much weight to diagnoses that come more readily to mind (e.g., recent dramatic case)

6. Base-rate neglect: failing to adequately take into account prevalence of a particular disease (e.g., erroneously interpreting a positive test as indicating disease in a low-prevalence population using a test with 5% false-positive rate)

7. Knowledge deficit (on part of provider, with accompanying lack of awareness)

8. Framing bias: Judgement overly influenced by the way the problem was presented (how it was framed in words, settings, situations)

9. Social/demographic/stereotype bias: biases from personal or cultural beliefs about women, minorities, or other patient groups for whom prejudices may distort diagnostic assessment
