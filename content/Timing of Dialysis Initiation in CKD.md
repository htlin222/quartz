### Timing of Dialysis Initiation in CKD

â€¢Â Â Â **IDEAL.** *N Eng J Med* 2010;363(7):609â€“619.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized controlled trial that randomized adults with progressive CKD and eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 to receive early initiation of dialysis vs. late initiation of diagnosis (usual care). Early initiation of dialysis did not improve survival, risk of CV events, or several dialysis-related outcomes when compared to initiation based on symptoms or eGFR <7.
