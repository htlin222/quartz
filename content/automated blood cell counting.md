# automated blood cell counting

- In addition to complete blood counts (CBCs) and the traditional 5-part leukocyte differential:
  - neutrophils
  - lymphocytes
  - monocytes
  - eosinophils
  - basophils
  - NOTE: Âü∫Êú¨ 5 Â§ßË°ÄÁêÉ

## newer hematology analyzers can also provide

- quantitative and qualitative information about:
  - reticulocytes
  - nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs)
  - immature granulocytes
  - platelet parameters, such as platelet immaturity
- Because of:
  - the large number of cells counted
  - analysis using multiple physical principles and sophisticated software:
    - "Figure 12-1": most analyzers use at least 2 techniques
- hematology analyzers produce accurate and precise CBCs and leukocyte differential counts, with the exception of basophils because of their low numbers.
- Many laboratories no longer report band neutrophils because:
  - accurate and precise identification by automated and morphologic techniques is poor
  - their clinical significance (if any) appears minimal, with the possible exception of:
    - neonatal sepsis
    - febrile children with sickle cell disease:
      - to identify bacterial infection in the setting of vaso-occlusive crisis
- In most clinical circumstances:
  - total white blood cell (WBC) count
  - automated absolute neutrophil count:
    - are better tests for identifying infection
- Hematology analyzers provide excellent sensitivity to distinguish between normal and abnormal samples via operator alerts (flags) prompting:
  - microscopic review of a stained peripheral blood film for selected samples
