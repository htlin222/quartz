# Follow-up, treatment response and failure of Migraine

* Use headache calendars
* Assess effectiveness and adverse events
* When outcomes are suboptimal, review diagnosis, treatment strategy, dosing and adherence
* When treatment fails, re-evaluate before changing
* Referral to specialist care should be reserved for patients whose condition is diagnostically challenging, difficult to treat or complicated by comorbidities
