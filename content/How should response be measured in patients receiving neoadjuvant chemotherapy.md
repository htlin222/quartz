# How should response be measured in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy

Recommendations
Recommendation 2.1.
Patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy should be monitored for response with clinical examination at regular intervals. Breast imaging may be used to confirm clinical suspicion of progression and for surgical planning. When imaging is used, the modality that was most informative at baseline-mammography, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging-should be used at follow-up (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).

Recommendation 2.2.
Blood- and tissue-based biomarkers should not be used for monitoring patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).

Recommendation 2.3.
Pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as absence of invasive disease in breast and lymph nodes, should be used to measure response to guide clinical decision making (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
