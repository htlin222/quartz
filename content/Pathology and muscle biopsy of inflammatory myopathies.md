# Pathology and muscle biopsy of inflammatory myopathies

> all with interstitial mononuclear infiltrates, muscle fiber necrosis, degeneration, & regeneration (required for definitive diagnosis)

- PM: CD8 T cell-mediated muscle injury; perivascular and endomysial inflammation surrounds MHC class I-expressing non-necrotic fibers
- DM: immune complex deposition in blood vessels with complement activation; perifascicular atrophy w/ interfascicular and perivascular inflam (B & CD4 T cells)
- NM: necrotic fibers w/ macrophages
- IBM: T cell-mediated injury, vacuole formation; same as PM w/ eosinophilic inclusions and rimmed vacuoles and chronic myopathic changes (variable fiber size)
