â€¢Â Â Â **Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia to Improve the Neurologic Outcome After Cardiac Arrest (HACA).** *N Eng J Med* 2002;346(8):549â€“556.

-Â Â Â Multicenter unblinded randomized controlled trial that randomized patients with return of systemic circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia to normothermia vs. 12â€“24**Â°**C of cooling to 32â€“34**Â°**C. Patients who underwent therapeutic hypothermia (32â€“34**Â°**C) had improved neurologic outcomes and reduced mortality at 6 months.
