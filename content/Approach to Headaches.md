### Approach to Headaches

•   History:

-   Is this an old or new headache? If old, how do the current headaches differ?

-   What’s the headache phenotype?

**•**   **PQRST:**

-   **P**rovocation – associated with stress, foods, posture, menstruation, lack of sleep?

-   **P**alliation – which medications have been tried, how often, treatment response?

-   **Q**uality

-   **Q**uantity

-   **R**egion – unilateral or bilateral?

-   **R**adiation – from neck or jaw? (may suggest cervicogenic headache or TMJ-associated headache)

-   **S**ymptoms – nausea/vomiting, photo/phonophobia, lacrimation/rhinorrhea, aura?

-   **T**iming – frequency (including \# of h/a per month), duration, onset (gradual or thunderclap), worse in morning (suggests increased ICP)?

-   Are there features suggestive of a primary headache disorder?

**•**   Associated features: Photo/phono/osmophobia, N/V, restlessness/agitation (TACs), allodynia?

**•**   Aura: Visual scotoma, scintillations, wavy lines in vision, photopsia, paresthesias?

**•**   Autonomic features (unilateral): Eye tearing, periorbital discoloration, ptosis or eyelid edema, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion/discharge, forehead/face sweating/flushing?

**•**   Triggers: Menses, alcohol, bright lights, loud sounds, weather changes, dehydration, skipped meals, stress, poor sleep?

**•**   Are there any headache red flags? **SNOOP**

-   **S**ystemic symptoms

-   **N**eurologic signs/symptoms

-   **O**lder age of onset (>50 yr)

-   **O**nset (sudden “thunderclap” headache)

-   **P**apilledema, **P**ositional (worse when supine → intracranial hypertension; worse when upright → intracranial hypotension), **P**recipitated by Valsalva, **P**regnant or **P**ost-partum, **P**attern change)

•   Physical exam:

-   Blood pressure and heart rate, palpate neck/shoulder for trigger points, evaluate spine and paraspinal musclces, palpate temporal arteries, ascultate for bruits, neurologic exam (including fundoscopic exam)

•   Imaging:

-   Indications for imaging include focal neurologic deficients, onset with exertion, new onset >50 yr, recent change in headache pattern, positional headache

-   MRI preferred but start with NCHCT in the acute setting

•   Labs:

-   Consider checking ESR/CRP in patients >50 yr given risk of giant cell arteritis
