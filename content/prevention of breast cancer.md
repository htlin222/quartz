# prevention of breast cancer

(if high-risk: eg, FHx, LCIS, atypical hyperplasia)

* Tamoxifen (contraindic. in preg): ↓ risk contralateral breast ca as adjuvant Rx. Approved for 1° prevent. if ↑ risk: ↓ invasive breast cancer, but ↑ DVT & uterine ca.
* Raloxifene (only if post-menopausal): ↓ risk of invas breast ca, vertebral fx, & uterine ca, ↑ risk stroke & DVT/PE (NEJM 2006;355:125); less effective than tamoxifen for prevention.
* Aromatase inhib. (post-menopausal): ↓ risk >50% (Lancet 2014;383:1041), ↑ osteoporosis
* BRCA1/2 ⊕: intensified surveillance vs. prophylactic bilat. mastectomy which ↓ risk ~90%; bilat. salpingo-oophorectomy ↓ risk of ovarian and breast cancer (NEJM 2016;374:454)

## Explain by ChatGPT

* The first paragraph is discussing the prevention of breast cancer, specifically in high-risk individuals. Tamoxifen is mentioned as a possible preventative measure, but it is contraindicated in pregnancy. Raloxifene is another option for post-menopausal women, but it is less effective than tamoxifen. **Aromatase inhibitors** are also mentioned as a preventative measure for post-menopausal women.

The second paragraph discusses the different risks associated with **tamoxifen and raloxifene**. Tamoxifen may decrease the risk of breast cancer, but it can also increase the **risk of DVT and uterine cancer**. **Raloxifene** may decrease the risk of breast cancer, but it can also increase the risk of **stroke** and DVT/PE.

The third paragraph discusses the different options for preventing breast cancer in women who **are BRCA1/2 positive**. Intensified surveillance is one option, but prophylactic **bilat mastectomy is more effective**, reducing the risk by 90%. Bilat **salpingo-oophorectomy** can also reduce the risk of ovarian and breast cancer.

第一段討論了乳腺癌的預防，特別是高危人群。提到他莫昔芬作為一種可能的預防措施，但它在懷孕期間是禁忌的。雷洛昔芬是絕經後婦女的另一種選擇，但效果不如他莫昔芬。芳香化酶抑製劑也被提及作為絕經後婦女的預防措施。

第二段討論了與他莫昔芬和雷洛昔芬相關的不同風險。他莫昔芬可降低患乳腺癌的風險，但也會增加深靜脈血栓和子宮癌的風險。雷洛昔芬可降低患乳腺癌的風險，但也會增加中風和 DVT/PE 的風險。

第三段討論了 BRCA1/2 陽性女性預防乳腺癌的不同選擇。強化監測是一種選擇，但預防性雙側乳房切除術更有效，可將風險降低 90%。雙側輸卵管卵巢切除術還可以降低患卵巢癌和乳腺癌的風險。
