# Sanford Guide: HBV Natural History
### Phases of Infection

*   Three phases of HBV infection.
*   Not all patients successfully make it through all 3 phases:

*   **Immune tolerant** phase (+HBeAg, +HBsAg, High level HBV DNA)
*   **Inflammatory** phase (reduction in HBV DNA; elevated transaminases)
*   **Non-Replicative** phase (loss of HBeAg; reduction of HBV DNA; normalization of ALT/AST).
