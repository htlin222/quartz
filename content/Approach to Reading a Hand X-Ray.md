### Approach to Reading a Hand X-Ray

â€¢Â Â Â Alignment: Misaligned joints can help suggest specific pathologies. For example, ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPs) is suggestive of rhematoid arthritis (RA).

â€¢Â Â Â Bone density: Lucency can be used to assess bone density; denser regions of bone are brighter on x-ray. When the lucency of juxta-articular bone is similar to that of the central metacarpal, there is said to be periarticular osteopenia, which is an early pathologic change in RA. Conversely, subchondral sclerosis (increased brightness of the juxta-articular bone) is suggestive of osteoarthritis (OA).

â€¢Â Â Â Cortical edges: Erosions appear as interruptions in the smooth contour of the peri-articular cortex and raise concern for the inflammatory arthropathies or erosive OA. Osteophytes appear as irregular outgrowths of bone and suggest OA.

â€¢Â Â Â Joint spaces: Joint space narrowing suggests arthritis, but does not distinguish inflammatory from non-inflammatory pathology.

â€¢Â Â Â Soft tissues: The triangular fibrocartilage sits between the ulna and the carpal bones and is a good site to assess for chondrocalcinosis (i.e., calcium pyrophosphate crystal build-up, commonly due to pseudogout).
