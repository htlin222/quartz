# figaro trial

- Use of the intensified RIC regimen FLAMSA-Bu did not improve allo-HSCT outcomes in patients with highâ€‘risk AML or MDS, regardless of pretransplant flow cytometric MRD status.
- However, pretransplant MRD status was correlated with an increased risk of relapse by both conventional and unsupervised analyses.
- The authors also proposed that acquisition of FDTCC may alleviate the adverse prognosis given by pretransplant MRD positivity and has potential as an approach to improve outcomes in patients transplanted with an RIC regimen.
