# hypereosinophilic syndrome

## Hypereosinophilia

- AEC >1.5 x 10^9/L or >1500 cells/microL on 2 exams separated by 1 month or pathologic confirmation of tissue HE.
- Tissue HE defined by percentage of eosinophils >20% of all nucleated cells on bone marrow section, extensive tissue infiltration, or marked deposition of eosinophil granule proteins in tissue.
- Immunofluorescence and monoclonal antibody can detect tissue eosinophils and eosinophil degranulation.

## Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES)

- HES defined by HE, eosinophil-mediated organ damage/dysfunction, and exclusion of other causes.
- HES can qualify any condition with eosinophilic infiltrates and complications including identified cause of HE.
- HES should not be used for clinical manifestations explained by mechanisms other than HE.

## Categories of HES

- HES subclassified as primary (clonal), secondary (polyclonal), or idiopathic.
- Primary HES: eosinophilic expansion with underlying neoplasm.
- Secondary HES: eosinophilic expansion driven by overproduction of cytokines by other cell types.
- Idiopathic HES: underlying cause of HE remains unknown.

## Other Clinical Situations Associated with HE

- Specific syndromes associated with HE such as eosinophilic granulomatosis and polyangiitis and certain immunodeficiencies.
- Hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance (HEUS) describes patients with persistent unexplained HE without apparent complications related to tissue eosinophilia.
