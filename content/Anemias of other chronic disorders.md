## Explain by ChatGPT

The first line states that anemia is a common symptom of chronic kidney disease, and can be treated with erythropoietin and iron supplements. The second line states that endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism can also cause anemia by reducing the body's oxygen demand. Anemia caused by endocrine disorders can be either normocytic or macrocytic.

## 窩的英文不太好

第一行指出貧血是慢性腎病的常見症狀，可以用促紅細胞生成素和鐵補充劑治療。第二行指出，甲狀腺機能減退等內分泌失調也會降低人體的需氧量，從而導致貧血。內分泌失調引起的貧血可以是正細胞性或大細胞性。
