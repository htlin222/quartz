## DIAGNOSIS AND CLINICAL STAGING

- < date > PET/CT scan:
- < date > Bronchoscopy:
- < date > EBUS/EUS:
- < date > TNM stage and grade:

### HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

- Core biopsy of primary tumour:
- Non-squamous:
  - Tested for EGFR mut. PD-L1, method used
- Squamous:
  - Tested for PD-L1, method used
- Tissue material available/stored for future molecular analyses YES NO
- CBC/DC, Liver Enzymes, LDH, Calcium, Albumin, Renal, Function
- IF the patient is scheduled for radical treatment, the following tests have been considered
  - (Stage III) Brain MRI, preferably to contrast-enhanced CT-scan
  - Lung function tests
  - Cardio-vascular check-up
- Timeline for further work-up has been checked and it is tight enough

### MDT discussion and decision

- Treatment options have been discussed with the patient and strategy accepte
  - Surgery Performed Planned
  - SBRT Radiotherapy Radiofrequency ablation (or similar ablative approach)
  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  - Adjuvant radiotherapy Adjuvant chemotherapy
  - Chemoradiation Concurrent Sequential
  - Durvalumab maintenance
  - Supportive and palliative care
  - Enrolment in a clinical trial
