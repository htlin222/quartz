- 想像在玩德州撲克，要去弄懂牌的 → 大小

- M1 = Stage IV ♠️
- N3 = Stage III - c ❤️❤️❤️
- T4 = Stage III - b or c ♣️♣️♣️♣️
- N2 = Stage III - a or b ❤️❤️

- From above, we know that T4 is
  - either Stage III - b or c (cannot be “a” and cannot be “c”)
  - T4N2 = Stage IIIb
  - Remaining T 1-3 is Stage IIIa
    - T 1,2,3 N2 = Stage IIIa
- T 跟 N 加起來
  - Add upto make 1: Stage I (T1No)
  - Add upto make 2: Stage IIa (T1N1 or T2N0)
  - Add upto make 3: Stage IIb (T3N0 or T2N1)
  - Add upto make 4: Stage IIIa (T3N1)
