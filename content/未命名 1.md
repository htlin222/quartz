## Efficacy of Pembrolizumab in HER2-Positive Gastro-Oesophageal Cancer: Results from KEYNOTE-811 Trial

- **Design:** Randomized, Phase 3 trial involving 168 medical centers in 20 countries worldwide. 
- **Number of patients:** 698 patients were assigned to pembrolizumab (n=350) or placebo (n=348). 
- **Patients characteristics:** Patients aged 18 years or older with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, without previous first-line treatment. 
- **Agent:** Pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo combined with standard chemotherapy (fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based therapy) plus trastuzumab every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or investigator or participant-initiated withdrawal. 
- **Treatment line:** First-line treatment.
- **Trial Name/NCT Number:** KEYNOTE-811 trial (NCT03615326).

- **Comparison of two groups:**

| Endpoints | Pembrolizumab Group | Placebo Group | Hazard Ratio (HR) | P-value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Median Progressi-free survival | 10.0 months (95% CI 8.6-12.2) | 8.1 months (95% CI 7.1-8.6) | 0.73 (0.61-0.87) | 0.0002 |
| Median Overall survival | 20.0 months (95% CI 17.8-22.1) | 16.8 months (95% CI 15.0-18.7) | 0.84 (0.70-1.01) | 0.084 |

- **Other findings:**

  - Pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival compared with placebo when combined with first-line trastuzumab and chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-positive gastro-oesophageal cancer.
  - Pembrolizumab was well-tolerated, with a manageable safety profile similar to placebo.

- **Summary:** The results of the interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-811 trial showed that pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival when combined with first-line trastuzumab and chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-positive gastro-oesophageal cancer. The trial is ongoing, and the final analysis will provide information on overall survival. Pembrolizumab was well-tolerated, with a manageable safety profile similar to placebo.
