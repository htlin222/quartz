# Ischemic stroke checklist

## Initial evaluation

- Perform primary survey.
- Determine the time of onset of symptoms and assess severity with NIHSS.
- Call for immediate neurology consult or activate stroke team.
- Establish IV access.
- Continuous cardiac monitoring
- Start supplemental O2 to keep SpO2 > 94%.
- Obtain POC glucose and treat immediately if < 60 mg/dL or > 400 mg/dL.
- Order immediate head CT (without contrast).
- Stabilize patient prior to neuroimaging as needed.
- Intubation and mechanical ventilation for airway protection or respiratory failure
- Blood pressure management for acute ischemic stroke for shock or hypertensive emergency
- Begin ICP management for cerebral herniation syndromes.
- Consider further imaging (e.g., MRI or CTA with or without perfusion protocol) without delaying reperfusion therapy.
- Evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria for thrombolysis in consultation with neurology.
- If thrombolysis is indicated:
- Lower blood pressure to < 185/110 mm Hg.
- Administer thrombolytic therapy (per neurologist).
- Evaluate indications for mechanical thrombectomy in discussions with stroke specialists.

## After stabilization

- Admit preferentially to stroke unit (medicine or neurology) or ICU for first 24 hours.
- Continue blood pressure management and other neuroprotective measures (e.g., euglycemia, normothermia).
- Perform serial neurological assessments.
- Identify and treat the underlying cause: ECG, laboratory studies, neurovascular studies.
- Ensure supportive care: e.g., NPO and dysphagia screening, VTE prophylaxis, physical and occupational therapy.
- Identify and treat any complications (e.g., seizures, neurogenic fever).
- Start secondary stroke prevention measures (e.g., antiplatelet therapy, statins).
- Obtain 24-hour follow-up imaging, if indicated (post thrombolysis).
