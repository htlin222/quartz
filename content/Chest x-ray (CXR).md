### Chest x-ray (CXR)

â€¢Â Â Â Types of CXR:

-Â Â Â PA and lateral CXR: Method: Radiation *posterior* â†’ *anterior*; obtained with lateral images. Indications: Most common modality used for lung imaging.

-Â Â Â AP portable CXR: Method: Radiation *anterior* â†’ *posterior*. Indications: Does not provide as much information as a PA CXR, but used for unstable or hospitalized patients since it is portable. Subject to issues with patient rotation. No lateral images and enlarges the cardiac silhouette.

-Â Â Â Lateral decubitus CXR: Method: Patient placed in the lateral decubitus position (on side) for CXR. Indications: Assessment of free-flowing vs. loculated pleural fluid. Increasingly replaced by point of care ultrasound (POCUS), especially for assessment of effusions.

â€¢Â Â Â Approach to interpretation of CXR:

-Â Â Â Verify patient name and date

-Â Â Â Identify CXR type

-Â Â Â Evaluate quality:

**â€¢**Â Â Â **R**otation: Clavicular symmetry, trachea midline

**â€¢**Â Â Â **I**nspiration: Count for 8.5â€“11 rib spaces above the diaphragm

**â€¢**Â Â Â **P**enetration: If thoracic spine seen through heart, film is overexposed

-Â Â Â Read systematically:

**â€¢**Â Â Â **A**irway (i.e., trachea)

**â€¢**Â Â Â **B**ronchoalveolar markings (Figure 2.7)

**â€¢**Â Â Â **C**ardiac silhouette (and assessment of mediastinum)

**â€¢**Â Â Â **D**iaphragm

**â€¢**Â Â Â **E**xtras/**E**verything Else (i.e., lung parenchyma, MSK, lines/tubes)
