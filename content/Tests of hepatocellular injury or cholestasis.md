## Aminotransferases (AST, ALT)

- intracellular enzymes released 2° necrosis/inflammation

ALT more specific for liver than is → AST (heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, RBC/WBC)

↑ levels seen w/ most types of hepatocellular injury; AST >ALT → **MSK injury, MI**

- Alkaline phosphatase (Aϕ): enzyme bound in **hepatic canalicular membrane** ↑ levels seen w/ biliary obstrxn, intrahepatic cholestasis or infiltration of the liver also found in **bone, intestines, kidney, placenta**; confirm from liver w/: ↑ GGT (or ↑ 5′-NT)

- Bilirubin: product of heme metab (unconjugated, “indirect”) **carried by alb** to liver where taken up for conjugation (“direct”) to make soluble, then → excreted into bile.
- ↑ indirect hyperbili seen with hemolysis, enzymatic disorders (eg, [[Crigler-Najjar]], [[Gilbert’s syndrome]]
- ↑ direct hyperbili seen with cholestasis, enzymatic disorders (eg, Dubin-Johnson, Rotor’s)
- [[jaundice]] seen when bili >2.5 mg/dL (esp. in sclera or under tongue); direct ↑ urine bili
