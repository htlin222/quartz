### Advanced Care Planning

â€¢Â Â Â **Advanced Directives and Outcomes of Surrogate Decision Making Before Death**. *N Engl J Med* 2010;362(13):1211â€“1218.

-Â Â Â This study used data from survey proxies in the Health and Retirement Study involving adults **â‰¥**60 yr who died between 2000 and 2006 to determine the prevalence of the need for decision making and lost decision-making capacity at the end of life. Many patients needed decision making near the end of life when most lacked the capacity to do so. Patients who had prepared advanced directives received care associated with their preferences, supporting the continued use of advanced directives.
