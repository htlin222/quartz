### S. aureus Bacteremia

â€¢Â Â Â **Impact of routine infectious diseases service consultation on the evaluation, management, and outcomes of** *Staphylococcus aureus* **bacteremia.** *Clin Infect Dis* 2008;46(7):1000â€“1008.

-Â Â Â This study compared evaluation, management, and outcomes of cases of *S. aureus* bacteremia (SAB) before and after an institution mandated consultation with infectious diseases for all cases of SAB. It demonstrated the landmark finding that infectious diseases consultation decreases rates of treatment failure, increased adherence to guideline-directed care, and improved the diagnosis of endocarditis and metastatic foci of infection.

â€¢Â Â Â **Impact of infectious disease consultation on quality of care, mortality, and length of stay in** *Staphylococcus aureus* **bacteremia: Results from a large multicenter cohort study.** *Clin Infect Dis* 2015;60(10):1451â€“1461.

-Â Â Â A retrospective cohort study that examined consecutive cases of SAB from six academic and community hospitals and compared those with and without infectious diseases consultation. Outcomes included quality measures of management (e.g., echocardiography, repeat blood cultures, removal of infectious foci, and antibiotic therapy), in-hospital mortality, and length of stay. ID consultation was associated with better quality measures, reduced in-hospital mortality, and decreased length of stay.

â€¢Â Â Â **\[Guideline\] Clinical practice guidelines by the infectious diseases society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant** *Staphylococcus aureus* **infections in adults and children**. *Clin Infect Dis* 2011;52(3):e18â€“55.

-Â Â Â This comprehensive clinical practice guideline includes recommendations from the IDSA on the management of multiple types of MRSA infections, including skin and soft tissue infection, endocarditis, bacteremia, CNS infections, and bone and joint infections. It also discusses treatment failure and emerging resistance patterns in MRSA (e.g., reduced vancomycin susceptibility).
