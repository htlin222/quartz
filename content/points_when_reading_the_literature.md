# points_when_reading_the_literature

- Is the number of subjects involved clearly stated?
- Are appropriate measures of location and variation used in the paper?
  - For example, if the distribution of the data is skewed, then has the median rather the mean been quoted? Is it sensible to quote a standard deviation, or would a range or interquartile range, be better?
  - In general do not use SD for data which have skewed distributions.
- On graphs, are appropriate axes clearly labelled and scales indicated?
- Do the titles adequately describe the contents of the tables and graphs?
- Do the graphs indicate the relevant variability? For example, if the main object of the study is a within‐subject comparison, has the within‐subject variability been illustrated?
- Does the method of display convey all the relevant information in a study? Can one assess the distribution of the data from the information given?
