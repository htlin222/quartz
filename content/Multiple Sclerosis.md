### Multiple Sclerosis

â€¢Â Â Â **Oral versus Intravenous Steroids for Treatment of Relapses in Multiple Sclerosis \[Cochrane Review\].** *Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews* 2012;(3)*:CD006921.*

-Â Â Â Meta-analysis of 167 randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing oral and intravenous steroids for acute multiple sclerosis relapses. The trials reviewed support the hypothesis that oral steroids are equally efficacious to IV steroids in treating MS exacerbations.

â€¢Â Â Â **A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Corticosteroids in the Treatment of Acute Optic Neuritis.** *N Eng J Med* 1992;326:581â€“588.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial that randomized patients with acute optic neuritis to receive high-dose IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone vs. placebo. High-dose IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone accelerated visual recovery but did not improve 6-month or 1-yr visual outcomes compared to placebo.
