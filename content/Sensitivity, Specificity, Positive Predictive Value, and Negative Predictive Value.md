### Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, and Negative Predictive Value



**FIGURE A2.2:** A 2 Ã— 2 table that compares the presence of disease vs. the results of testing for the disease (e.g., disease- prostate cancer, test- PSA). The columns indicate whether the disease is present (\+) or absent (-). The rows indicate whether the test result is positive (\+) or negative (-). TP = True positive, FP = False positive, FN = False negative, TN = True negative. This table can be used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. See formulas on the next page.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Sensitivity = TP/(TP\+FN)

-Â Â Â The probability that when a disease is present, a diagnostic test will have a positive result

-Â Â Â In other words, what proportion of all positive patients (i.e., TP \+ FN) will have a positive result?

-Â Â Â Highly sensitive tests are less likely to miss cases (i.e., unlikely to have false negative results)

-Â Â Â Therefore, â†‘Sensitivity then â†‘NPV

â€¢Â Â Â Specificity = TN/(TN\+FP)

-Â Â Â The probability that when a disease is absent, a diagnostic test will have a negative result

-Â Â Â In other words, what proportion of all negative patients (i.e., TN \+ FP) will have a negative result?

-Â Â Â Highly specific tests are less likely to have false positive results

-Â Â Â Therefore, â†“Specificity then â†“PPV

â€¢Â Â Â Positive predictive value (PPV) = TP/(TP\+FP)

-Â Â Â The probability that a person who has a positive test result actually has a disease

-Â Â Â In other words, what proportion of positive results are true positives?

â€¢Â Â Â Negative predictive value (NPV) = TN/(TN\+FN)

-Â Â Â The probability that a person who has a negative test result actually does not have a disease

-Â Â Â In other words, what proportion of negative results and true negatives?

-Â Â Â If a disease is more prevalent, there is a higher PPV and lower NPV. Sensitivity and specificity are not affected by disease prevalence

â€¢Â Â Â Likelihood ratio (\+) = Sensitivity / (1-Specificity)

â€¢Â Â Â Likelihood ratio (âˆ’) = (1-Sensitivity) / Specificity
