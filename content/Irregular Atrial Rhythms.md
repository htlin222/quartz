### Irregular Atrial Rhythms

##### Premature atrial complexes (PACs)

•   Description: Most common cause of irregular pulse and palpitations; benign, increased frequency with age, illness, tobacco/alcohol/caffeine

•   ECG: Extra P waves, often with different morphology, and can be followed by a pause

•   Treatment: None required unless symptomatic

##### Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)

•   Description: Increased automaticity at multiple sites in the atria. Associated with COPD, HF, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia.

•   ECG: ≥3 P waves with differing morphologies, atrial rates usually 100–130 bpm

•   Treatment: CCB or BB if tolerated; treat underlying disease process

##### Atrial flutter with variable block

•   Description: Atrial flutter with alternating block (e.g., 2:1 then 3:1). See Atrial flutter on prior page.

##### Atrial fibrillation (Afib)

•   Description: Low-amplitude atrial activity that often originates in the pulmonary veins and oscillates at a rate of ~300–600 bpm; atrial activity is transmitted irregularly through the AV node, resulting in an irregular (often fast) ventricular rate

•   Predisposing factors: Heart disease (e.g., CAD, MI, HTN, valve), older age, obesity, OSA

•   Episodic/reversible triggers: Infection, heart surgery, VTE/PE, hyperthyroidism, alcohol, stress

•   Symptoms: Fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, irregular pulse, thrombi, stroke

•   ECG: Irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm (e.g., irregular RR intervals, tiny erratic spikes), no P waves (Figure 1.14)

•   Workup of new Afib: TSH, BMP, LFTs, TTE; calculate CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores (online calculators) to help determine need for anticoagulation, ambulatory ECG monitor (assess rate control), \+/– sleep study

•   Classifications:

-   Paroxysmal (<7 days) vs. persistent (>7 days) vs. long-standing persistent (>1 yr) vs. permanent (refractory to cardioversion)

-   Valvular vs. nonvalvular

-   Lone Afib (age <60 yr, without hypertension or structural heart disease)

-   Symptomatic (~75%) vs. asymptomatic (~25%)

•   Treatment of Afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR):

-   Assess patient stability: Heart rate, blood pressure, mental status

•   **UNSTABLE**: Emergent synchronized cardioversion

•   **STABLE**: Manage as follows:

-   Identify and treat the triggering condition (e.g., infection, drugs, subarachnoid hemorrhage, medication noncompliance)

-   Rate control: Options for rate control agents include the following, in order of preference:

•   Beta blocker (careful in decompensated HF)

•   Calcium channel blocker (contraindicated in HF)

•   Amiodarone (also used for rhythm control so may result in cardioversion)

•   Digoxin (longterm use associated with increased mortality)

-   Consider cardioversion:

•   Types: Pharmacological (amiodarone) or electrical (direct current cardioversion \[DCCV\])

•   Obtain TEE before cardioversion in most patients, especially if not reliably anticoagulated for >4 weeks or Afib duration >48 hours (unless emergent)

•   Contraindication to cardioversion: Presence of left heart thrombus

•   Post-cardioversion: All patients require 4 weeks of anticoagulation due to increased stroke risk from cardiac stunning (although most will require lifelong anticoagulation due to an elevated CHA2DS2-VASc score)

•   Treatment of chronic Afib:

-   **Treat reversible causes and triggers** (e.g., OSA, obesity, hyperthyroidism, heart failure)

-   **Reduce stroke risk:**

**•**   Anticoagulation:

-   **Valvular Afib:** e.g., Afib from mitral stenosis. Anticoagulate with warfarin (INR goal 2–3)

-   **Nonvalvular Afib:** Anticoagulate if history of TIA/stroke or CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2 (~2% annual stroke risk). Consider for CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (<1% annual stroke risk). Reconsider anticoagulation if HAS-BLED ≥5 (≥12% annual major bleeding risk with warfarin). Choice of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (e.g., apixaban 5 mg BID, rivaroxaban 20 mg daily with food, or dabigatran 150 mg BID). If patient on DAPT for CAD and Afib, discontinue the second antiplatelet and only use dual therapy (**RE-DUAL 2017**).

-   **Post-op Afib:** Patients with new Afib after cardiac surgery usually don’t need chronic anticoagulation; anticoagulate for 2–3 months, then discontinue if confirmed sinus on ambulatory ECG monitoring.

**•**   Procedures:

-   Left atrial appendage closure: Patients may be able to discontinue anticoagulation if success of closure confirmed by TEE; can be done surgically or percutaneously (WATCHMAN procedure).

-   **Manage the arryhthmia:**

**•**   Rate control:

-   Rate control is noninferior to rhythm control in asymptomatic patients >65 yr (**AFFIRM 2002**), although rhythm control is still preferred for certain patients

-   Types of rate control therapies:

•   Medications: BB or CCB to achieve goal HR <110 bpm with activity (**RACE II 2010**)

•   Procedures (less commonly used strategy): AV node ablation and pacemaker placement

**•**   Rhythm control:

-   Consider for:

•   Symptomatic patients

•   Young patients (generally recommend at least one DC cardioversion \[DCCV\] attempt)

•   HFrEF (catheter ablation may have improved outcomes, **CASTLE-AF 2018**)

-   Types of rhythm control therapies:

•   Cardioversion:

-   Indicated to restore sinus rhythm at least once in patients with persistent Afib who are <65 yr or ≥65 yr and symptomatic despite rate control

-   Duration of sustained sinus rhythm following cardioversion is variable, and early reversion to Afib occurs frequently in patients with a history of long-standing persistent Afib or LA diameter >5 cm

•   Antiarrhythmic drugs:

-   Scheduled medications: Goal to suppress Afib episodes tô1×/year; rarely completely eliminates Afib. Options: Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), class IC (flecainide, propafenone), class III (sotalol, dofetilide); amiodarone (used for select patients given long-term side effects)

-   PRN dosing: Flecainide or propafenone “pill-in-pocket” strategy; appropriate in paroxysmal symptomatic Afib with CHA2DS2-VASc 0 in “lone Afib”

•   Procedures:

-   Cryoballoon ablation: Percutaneous; circumferential ablation around the pulmonary vein (PV) antrum for PV isolation; risk of phrenic nerve injury and PV stenosis; typically requires less technical skill and time than radiofrequency ablation

-   Radiofrequency catheter ablation: Percutaneous; mapping with directed ablation for PV isolation; similar efficacy to cryoballoon with possibly fewer complications

-   MAZE procedure: Surgical; intraoperative ablation to isolate PVs, most often performed in patients getting cardiac surgery for another indication or those who failed catheter ablation
