## Pathophysiological changes that favor thrombosis in patients with cancer include

* platelet activation
* direct factor X activation,
* decreased hepatic anticoagulant synthesis
* reduced hepatic clearance of coagulation factors
* and autoimmune phenomena such as the development of antiphospholipid antibodies

Most patients with active cancer have evidence of chronic systemic coagulation activation, such as elevated plasma d-dimer levels
