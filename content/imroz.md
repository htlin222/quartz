### Isatuximab Plus VRd in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Ineligible for Transplantation

**Information**

- **Design**: Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center
- **Number of patients**: 446
- **Patients characteristics**: Patients 18 to 80 years of age with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible to undergo transplantation
- **Agent**: Isatuximab plus [[bortezomib.md|bortezomib]], lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) vs VRd alone
- **Treatment line**: First-line therapy
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: IMROZ (NCT03319667)

**Comparison of two groups**

| Endpoint                                                                          | Isatuximab-VRd                         | VRd            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Progression-Free Survival at 60 months                                            | 63.2%                                  | 45.2%          |
| Hazard Ratio for Disease Progression or Death                                     | 0.60 (98.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.88); P<0.001 | -              |
| Complete Response or Better                                                       | 74.7%                                  | 64.1%; P=0.01  |
| Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)â€“Negative Status in Patients with Complete Response | 55.5%                                  | 40.9%; P=0.003 |

**Other findings**

- No new safety signals were observed with the isatuximab-VRd regimen
- The incidence of serious adverse events during treatment and the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation were similar in the two groups

**Summary**
In this phase 3 trial, the addition of isatuximab to the VRd regimen significantly improved progression-free survival, complete response or better, and minimal residual disease-negative status in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible to undergo transplantation.
