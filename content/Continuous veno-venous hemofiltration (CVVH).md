# Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)

* Hemofiltration rather than dialysis. 
* Blood under pressure passes down one side highly permeable membrane filtering H2O and solutes via TMP gradient (convective clearance); filtrate discarded.
* Replacement fluid infused (solute concentration similar to plasma, except no urea, Cr, PO4). 
* Fluid balance by adjusting filtrate/replacement fluid.

## [[Replacement fluid of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration]] 

## Other CRRT modalities: 
CVVHD (dialysis), CVVHDF (filtration & dialysis) (AJKD 2016;68:645)

## Benefits compared w/ HD: 
â†“ gross fluid shift (preferred in HoTN), but slower clearance of solutes and toxins
