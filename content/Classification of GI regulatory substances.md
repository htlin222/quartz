# Classification of GI regulatory substances

*Â Hormones: Released from endocrine cells in the GI tract into the **portal circulation**. They enter the systemic circulation and then act on target cells

*Â Paracrines: Released from endocrine cells in the GI tract, diffuse locally, and then act on target cells

*Â Neurocrines: Synthesized by neurons in the GI tract, released by action potentials across the synaptic cleft, and then act on target cells
