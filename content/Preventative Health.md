### Preventative Health

â€¢Â Â Â **ASPREE**. *N Engl J Med* 2018;379(16):1â€“10.

-Â Â Â Multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo controlled trial that randomized healthy, community-dwelling older adults (age â‰¥70 yr or â‰¥65 yr in Hispanic or black patients in the United States) without a history of CVD, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, or any other chronic condition that would likely limit survival to less than 5 yr) to receive either aspirin 100 mg daily or placebo and followed prospectively for all-cause death, dementia, or physical disability. Over almost 5 yr of follow up, rates of disability-free survival were similar between the aspirin and placebo groups (21.5 vs. 21.2 events per 1000 person-years in aspirin and placebo groups, respectively). Aspirin was associated with higher incidence of major hemorrhage (8.6 vs. 6.2 events per 1000Â person years respectively).

â€¢Â Â Â **COLONPREV**. *N Engl J Med* 2018;379(16):1â€“10.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized, controlled noninferiority trial that randomized over 50,000 patients to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) every 2 yr vs. one-time colonoscopy. In the interim analysis, FIT was non-inferior to baseline colonoscopy in detecting colorectal cancer. 10-yr outcomes will be reported in 2021.
