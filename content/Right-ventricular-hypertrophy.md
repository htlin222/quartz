* Etiologies: cor pulmonale, congenital (tetralogy of Fallot, TGA, PS, ASD, VSD), MS, TR

* Criteria [all insensitive, but specific (except in COPD); all w/ poor PPV in general population]

R >S in V1, R in V1 ≥6 mm, S in V5 ≥10 mm, S in V6 ≥3 mm, R in aVR ≥4 mm

RAD ≥110° (LVH + RAD or prominent S in V5 or V6 → consider biventricular hypertrophy)
