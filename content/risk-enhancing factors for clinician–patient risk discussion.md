# risk-enhancing factors for clinicianâ€“patient risk discussion

* Risk-Enhancing Factors
* Family history of premature ASCVD (males, age <55 y; females, age <65 y)
* Primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C. 160-189 mg/dL [4.1-4.8 mmol); non-HDL-C 190-219 mg/dL [4.9-5.6 mmol/L)) Metabolic syndrome (increased waist circumference, elevated triglycerides I> 150 mg/dLl, elevated blood pressure, elevated glucose, and low HDL-C I<40 mg/dL in men; <50 in women mg/dL] are factors; tally of 3 makes the diagnosis)
* Chronic kidney disease (eGFR 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m? with or without albuminuria; not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation)
* Chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, RA, or HIVIAIDS
* History of premature menopause (before age y 40 y) and history of pregnancy-associated conditions that increase later ASCVD risk such as preeclampsia
* High-risk race/ethnicities (eg, South Asian ancestry)
