# Aspiration pneumonitis

Treatment recommendations for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia â€“ For patients with a clinical picture that is strongly suggestive of aspiration pneumonia acquired in a community setting (eg, witnessed aspiration event, risk factors for aspiration, compatible imaging, subacute course, putrid breath), we select an antibiotic regimen that includes coverage for most pathogenic oral flora, including anaerobic bacteria. The specific regimen varies with the clinical setting, severity of illness, risk factors for resistant pathogens, and antibiotic allergies (algorithm 1) (see 'Choice of regimen' above):

## Treatment recommendations for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia

- For **patients** with a clinical **picture** that is strongly suggestive of **aspiration** **pneumonia** acquired in a **community** **setting** ( eg , witnessed **aspiration** **event** , **risk** **factors** for **aspiration** , compatible **imaging** , subacute **course** , putrid **breath** ) , we select an antibiotic **regimen** that includes **coverage** for most pathogenic oral **flora** , including anaerobic **bacteria** .
- The specific **regimen** **varies** with the clinical **setting** , **severity** of **illness** , **risk** **factors** for resistant **pathogens** , and antibiotic **allergies** ( algorithm 1 ) ( see 'Choice of **regimen** ' above ) :


## Treatment recommendations for hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia

- For **patients** with **aspiration** **pneumonia** acquired in a **hospital** **setting** , we generally target aerobic **bacteria** , because they are generally more important than **anaerobes** , using standard **hospital** acquired **pneumonia** ( **HAP** ) **algorithms** ( algorithm 3 and algorithm 4 ) .
- However , for **patients** with a witnessed **aspiration** , severe periodontal **disease** , imaging suggesting a necrotizing **process** , or **failure** to respond to an antibiotic **regimen** without anaerobic **coverage** , we add anaerobic **coverage** .
