# Definitions-acute aortic syndromes

(Circ 2010;121:e266; Eur Heart J 2012;33:26)

- Aortic dissection:
  - intimal tear
  - → blood extravasates into Ao media (creates false lumen)
- Intramural hematoma (IMH):
  - vasa vasorum rupture
  - → medial hemorrhage that does not communicate with aortic lumen;
  - 6% of aortic syndromes;
  - clinically managed as AoD
- Penetrating ulcer:
  - atherosclerotic plaque penetrates elastic lamina
  - → medial hemorrhage
