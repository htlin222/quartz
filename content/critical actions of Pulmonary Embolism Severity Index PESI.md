# critical actions of Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index PESI

* The PESI is only meant for risk stratification of pulmonary embolism after the diagnosis has been made.
* Findings which could point toward clinically significant PE should not be overlooked in the setting of a low PESI score.
* Additional pathology which could lead to morbidity or mortality should not be overlooked in the setting of a low PESI score.
* All results for the validation of the PESI were made with patients who were treated for PE initially with enoxaparin, and then encouraged to transition to vitamin K antagonists.
