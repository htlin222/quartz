- **Gout (Rheumatology 2018;58:27)**

- Acute Clinical:

  - Sudden onset painful mono-articular arthritis (classically podagra [MTP of great toe]) or bursitis; frequently nocturnal
  - May be polyarticular in subsequent flares
  - Can mimic cellulitis (especially in the foot)

- Chronic Clinical:

  - Solid crystal deposition (tophus) in joints (esp. toes, fingers, wrists, knees) & tissue (esp. olecranon bursa, pinna, Achilles)
  - "Pseudo-RA" w/ polyarticular arthritis w/ morning stiffness or "Pseudo-OA"

- Associated Conditions:

  - Metabolic syndrome; CKD; CHF

- Crystal:

  - Monosodium urate (MSU)

- Polarized Microscopy\*:

  - Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent

- Radiographic Findings:

  - Early = nonspecific tissue swelling
  - Late = tophus, joint erosions w/ overhanging edges
  - "Double contour sign" on MSK US
  - DECT: UrA vs. Ca deposits

- Other:

  - a/w uric acid stones; urate nephropathy

- [[Pseudogout]] (NEJM 2016;374:2575)

  - from: [[Clinical manifestations of CPPD]] ó°’–

- Acute Clinical:

  - Mono- or asymmetric oligoarthritis (esp knees, wrists, and MCP joints); rare axial involvement (eg, crowned dens syndrome)

- Chronic Clinical:

  - "Pseudo-RA" w/ polyarticular arthritis w/ morning stiffness or "Pseudo-OA"

- Associated Conditions:

  - 3 H's: Hyper-PTH, Hypo-Mg, Hemochromatosis

- Crystal:

  - Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate

- Polarized Microscopy\*:

  - Rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent

- Radiographic Findings:

  - Chondrocalcinosis: linear densities within articular cartilage; often found in menisci, fibrocartilage of wrist, hands, symphysis pubis

- Other:
  - âœ“ Ca, Mg, Fe, ferritin, TIBC, UrA, PTH in young or severe cases

Note: Polarized microscopy is a laboratory technique used to analyze crystals in synovial fluid and helps in the diagnosis of gout and pseudogout.
