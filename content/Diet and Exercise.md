### Diet and Exercise

â€¢Â Â Â **Association of Step Volume and Intensity With All-Cause Mortality in Older Woman**. *JAMA Intern Med* 2019;179(8):1105â€“1112.

-Â Â Â Cohort study of 16,741 women with a mean age of 72 yr, measured steps per day over 7 days. Women who averaged 4,400 steps/day had significantly lower mortality rates during follow up of 4.3 yr (HR 0.75) compared with the less active women (2,700 steps/day). Mortality rates progressively decreased with increasing steps, with a plateau at 7,500 steps/day (HR 0.45).

â€¢Â Â Â **EPIC trial.** *JAMA Intern Med* 2019;179(11):1479â€“1490.

-Â Â Â Population-based cohort study of 451,743 individuals from 10 countries in Europe who self-reported intake of soft drinks (diet and regular). Higher all-cause mortality was found among participants who consumed 2 or more glasses/day vs. <1 glass/month (HR 1.17, 95% CI, 1.11â€“1.22, p < 0.001). Regular and diet soda is associated with mortality, especially CV disease.
