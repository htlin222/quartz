# DÃ¶hle bodies

* DÃ¶hle bodies are single or multiple blue cytoplasmic inclusions that are remnants of rough endoplasmic reticulum.
* They are associated with myeloid left shifts and are seen in conjunction with toxic granulation.
* In the upper cell, they can be clearly seen near the cell membrane.
