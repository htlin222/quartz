## Diagnosis and management (Lancet Rheumatol 2019;1:e55)

- Biopsy w/ specific findings:
  - _lymphoplasmacytic_ infiltrate
  - w/ significant IgG4+ plasma cell infiltrate,
  - storiform fibrosis,
  - [[obliterative phlebitis]]
- â†‘ serum IgG4 (Se 90%, Sp 60%); may have _low_ C3, C4
- Highly responsive to steroids but relapse common.
