# Antiplatelet Therapy

## [[Aspirin]]
## P2Y12 (ADP receptor) inhibitor (choose one of the following in addition to ASA).
Timing (on presentation or at angiography) remains controversial.
### [[Ticagrelor]] (preferred over clopi)
### [[Prasugrel]] (preferred over clopi)
### [[Clopidogrel]]
### [[Cangrelor]]
## GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI)
abciximab; eptifibatide; tirofiban

Infusions given ≤24 h peri & post PCI; shorter (~2 h) as effective w/ ↓ bleeding (JACC 2009;53:837)

No clear benefit for routinely starting prior to PCI and ↑ bleeding (NEJM 2009;360:2176)
Consider if refractory ischemia despite optimal Rx while awaiting angio or in high-risk Pts (eg, large clot burden) at time of PCI, espec if using clopi and no preRx.
Consider for rapidly reversible P2Y12 inhib peri-PCI or as bridge to surgery in high-risk Pts who need to stop P2Y12

> Transition from cangrelor to oral P2Y12 inhib.: ticagrelor loading dose during infusion or immediately after d/c of infusion; prasugrel or clopidogrel loading dose only immediately after d/c of infusion.
