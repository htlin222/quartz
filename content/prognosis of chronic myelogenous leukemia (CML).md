# prognosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)

(NEJMÂ 2017;376:917)

## Chronic phase CML Rxâ€™d w/ **imatinib**:

- 89% 5-y overall survival,
- 95% survival free of CML-related deaths,
- 7% progression to blast phase at 5 y
  - (NEJMÂ 2006;355:2408).
- Pts in CCyR (~equal to QT-PCR if 1% IS)
  - have normal life expectancy.
- QT-PCR >4-log

  - â†“ can consider TKI discontinuation trial
  - (Lancet OncÂ 2018;19:747).

- Stage of disease at dx is strongest predictor of outcome (chronic vs. accel/blast phase)
- OS nearing nl life expectancy (if diagnosed in chronic phase) in TKI era
- Various scoring systems devised to predict outcomes at dx:
  - [[Sokal score]]
  - Hasford score (categories: low vs. intermediate vs. high; same elements as Sokal, as well as peripheral blood basophils/eosinophils) (JNCI 1998;90:850)

* ELTS (EUTOS long term survival score):
  - Categories: Low vs. intermediate vs. high; same elements as Sokal; different weighting, imatinib-based (Leukemia 2020;34(8):2138)
