# contact dermatitis

- Pathophysiology: Two types - irritant is â†’ more common than allergic
- Irritant: Direct damage to the skin from harsh chemicals, soaps, or detergents
  -Â Allergic: Type IV hypersensitivity reaction to a particular antigen (e.g., poison oak/ivy, nickel, iodine, bacitracin); sensitized T-cells trigger an eczematous eruption at â†£ the site of contact
- Clinical features: Intensely pruritic erythematous papules and vesicles in the exposed areas
- Treatment: Avoid causative agents; severe eruptions may require topical glucocorticoids or systemic steroids; if dermatitis is â†’ severe or life-altering (e.g., job threatening) consider patch testing to determine cause
