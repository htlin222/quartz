**FIGURE 5.2: Hormones secreted by the pituitary gland and their functions.** The pituitary is a small gland that is positioned in the base of the brain. The pituitary controls the function of most other endocrine glands, secreting the hormones shown here, which each act on distinct target organ(s) or tissues. As is shown, certain hormones are secreted by the anterior lobe, whereas other hormones are secreted by the posterior lobe.
