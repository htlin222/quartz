# Treatment of viral respiratory infections

- Influenza (A & B):
  - Neuraminidase inhib. (eg, [[oseltamivir]]);
  - must start w/in 48 h of sx for low-risk; for critically ill or immunosupp.,
  - start ASAP even if >48 h. Peramivir IV if unable to tolerate PO.
  - Endonuclease inhib. (baloxavir),
    - superior to oseltamivir in â†“ sx & viral load on 1st day of Rx,
    - but resistance emerging;
    - no data in severe influenza (NEJM 2018; 379:913)
- RSV:
  - can consider inhaled ribavirin in immunosupp,
  - but very expensive & rarely used
