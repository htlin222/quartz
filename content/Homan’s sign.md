# Homanâ€™s sign

* Homanâ€™s sign test also called **dorsiflexon sign test** is a physical examination procedure that is used to test for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).
* A positive Homanâ€™s sign in the presence of other clinical signs may be a quick indicator of DVT.
* Clinical evaluation alone cannot be relied on for patient management, but when carefully performed, it remains useful in determining the need for additional testing (like D-dimer test, ultrasonography, multidetector helical computed axial tomography (CT), and pulmonary angiography)

## techniques
* In performing this test the patient will need to actively extend his knee.
* Once the knee is extended the examiner raises the patientâ€™s straight leg to 10 degrees, then passively and abruptly dorsiflexes the foot and squeezes the calf with the other hand.
