# haploidentical

HAPLO

BM or PBSC from half-matched related donor

## Advantages

- Most pts will have at least 1 potential donor
- Advent of post-HCT Cy ([[ptcy.md|PTCy]]) to deplete alloreactive T cells has reduced risk of GVHD & rejection
- Lower cost of procurement than URD or CB
- â†“ rates of cGVHD compared to even MRD; â†“ rates of aGVHD compared to MUD & MMUD
(JAMA Oncol 2019;5:1739)

## Disadvantages

- Less long-term data
