- PK/PD:
  - Extensive tissue distribution;
  - saturable catabolism;
  - excretion via metabolism, lung, & urine;

- [[AEs of Fluorouracil|AEs]] 󰒖: 💩👄🤮🩸🤞🫀👁️🖐️🦶😇🐌
- DDI: CYP2C9 substrates (↓ substrate levels),
  - cimetidine (↓ clearance of 5-FU),
  - oral anticoagulants (↑ levels of anticoagulants),
  - leucovorin (↑ tox of 5-FU)
- Clinical pearls:
  - AEs w/ DPD deficiency (prolonged clearance, ↑ tox), radiosensitizer;
