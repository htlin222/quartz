## PANCREATIC_ADJ

### Pancreatic head (uncinate process) ductal (M/D) adenocarcinoma s/p laparoscopic Whipple operation on 2017/00/00, pT3N1(1/9)M0, stage IIB, margin involved by invasive carcinoma, LVI+, perineural invasion+, vascular invasion -, 2017/00/00 CT post-op changes

- Initial presentation:
- Treatment plan: adjuvant chemotherapy
- Follow up parameter: CA-199, abdominal CT scan
- 2017/00/00: The purpose of adjuvant treatment is to improve DFS and OS but not 100%. Adjuvant treatment should be administered to patients who have not had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and who have adequately ercovered from surgery; treatment would be initiated w/in 12 weeks. If systemic chemotherapy precedes CCRT, restaging with imaging should be done after each treatment modality. Patient who have recieved neoadjuvant CCRT or chemotherapy may be candidates for additional chemotherapy following surgery and multidisciplinary review. The adjuvant therapy options are dependent on the response to neoadjuvant therapy and other clinical considerations.
- 2017/00/00 Explain adjuvant chemotherapy treatment option, such as Gem alone (CONKO-001 study, 1000mg/m2 D1,8,15, q4w for 6 months, OS HR:0.76), 5FU/LV (425/20 IV bolus D1-D5 QM for 6 months, mOS 23.6 month), and GEM + capcitabine (1660mg/m2 D1-D21, Q4weeks, HR 0.82).

  \*\*Emphasize the importance of nutrional support (high protein diet) during C/T period.

## APTT

## Comfirmed COVID on ?

\*COVID-19 Vaccination history?

### APTT prolongation, nature?

- LMP on 2022/11/26, no menorrhgia
  @ Operation is okay
  @ APTT prolong, do further survey as uptodate suggested below.
  @ Do mixing test, if correctable then check factor VIII, IX, or XI. Check for DIC profile as well. If the mixing study fails to correct, we test for the presence of a lupus anticoagulant and factor VIII activity (the latter to detect a rare patient with acquired hemophilia A).
  @ Survey for autoimmune disease and lupus anticoagulants (APTT prolong with lupus anticoagulant+, do confirmatory test with anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-B2-GP1 IgG and IgM test.). Check VWF antigen and activity (need to send to 榮總)
  @ Follow up 1 month with APTT.
  @ Do upper abdominal sono to rule out splenomegaly

## APTTPT

### Mild PT and severe APTT prolong, etiology to be determined, mild easily ecchymosis recently, no but menorrahgia, suspected asymptomatic lupus anticoagulant, rule out factor deficiency, rule out super wafarin intoxicification but not likely

- No chinese medicine or other drug exposure except drinking some collagen fiber
- Previous APTT/PT data if available
  @ do mixing test
  @ check for factors IVVV, IX, or XI, and lupus anticoagulant activity
  @ Check PT/APTT again on ?
  \*\*If the aPTT is prolonged and the PT is normal, we do a mixing study. If the mixing study corrects, then we perform assays for factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. Even though factor XII deficiency is not associated with bleeding, it may explain a prolonged aPTT that corrects with mixing. If the mixing study fails to correct, we test for the presence of a lupus anticoagulant and factor VIII activity (the latter to detect a rare patient with acquired hemophilia A).

## Adrenal

Dear doctor:
This is a patient of esophageal cancer under Pembrolizumab and PF since 2020/12/15. Cortisol level on 12/17 was 1.74ug/dl. However, the patient did not have symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency until days ago when he suffered from shock. He had better appetite today.
My opinion is check AM Cortisol and ACTH tomorrow (before 10AM). If cortisol level is still low, you may give him Solu-Cortef 50mg iv stat, than observe the response of blood pressure. If his blood pressure becomes normalized after Solu-Cortef, physical dose supplement of cortisone acetate (25/12.5mg bid) may be necessary.
Please contact with me for further management.

There is no consensus as to the optimal adjuvant approach. The rate of recurrence is about ~50% and above. The purpose of adjuvant CCRT (DFS HR 0.61 for chemotherapy, HR 0.43 for CCRT, recurrence rate 39%, in metaanalysis 2016) is to prolong disease free survival and overall survival and decrease risk of recurrence and distant mets but not 100%.
