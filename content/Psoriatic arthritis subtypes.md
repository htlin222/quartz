# Psoriatic arthritis subtypes

- **Mono/oligoarticular (large or DIP joint, dactylitic digit):**
  - Most common initial manifestation
  - Large joint involvement
  - Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint involvement
  - Dactylitic digit (sausage-like swelling of a finger or toe)
- **Polyarthritis (small joints of the hands/feet, wrists, ankles, knees, elbows):**
  - Indistinguishable from Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) but often asymmetric
- **Arthritis mutilans:**
  - Severe destructive arthritis with bone resorption, especially in the hands
- **Axial disease:**
  - Unilateral/asymmetric sacroiliitis
- **DIP-limited:**
  - Good correlation with nail pitting and onycholysis
