# Echocardiogram for Constrictive vs Restrictive Pericarditis


### Constrictive
Respirophasic variation (25–40%): inspir. → ↑ flow across TV and ↓ flow across MV
e′ (tissue velocity) nl/↑ (>12 cm/sec)
Expir. hepatic vein flow reversal
Septal bounce in early diastole
Normal wall thickness

### Restrictive
<10% respirophasic variation
Slower peak filling rate
Longer time to peak filling rate
e′ ↓ (<8 cm/sec; Se & Sp ~95%)
Inspir. hepatic vein flow reversal
Biatrial enlargement
± ↑ wall thickness
