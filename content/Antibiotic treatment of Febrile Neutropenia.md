# Antibiotic treatment of Febrile Neutropenia

- Low-risk patients with febrile neutropenia should receive initial doses of empirical antibacterial therapy within 1 hour of triage and monitored for â‰¥4 hours before discharge.
  - An oral fluoroquinolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or clindamycin, if allergy to penicillin) is â†’ recommended as empirical outpatient therapy, unless fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was used before fever developed.
  - Patients who do not defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen should be reevaluated and considered as candidates for inpatient treatment.
- High-risk patients should be started on empiric antipseudomonal monotherapy with either cefepime or ceftazidime, or if allergic, a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam (algorithm varies by institutional standards and local resistance patterns).
- Other antibiotics may be added for specific complications or known/suspected antimicrobial resistance.
- Vancomycin is â†’ generally not administered empirically except in special circumstances (including suspected catheter-related infection, pneumonia, hemodynamic instability, or skin or soft tissue infection). If vancomycin is â†’ given, it should be discontinued after 48 hours if cultures remain negative and there is â†’ no evidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
- Patients with a history of antibiotic-resistant organisms may require alternative regimens.
- Antibiotic regimens may be modified as clinical and laboratory data results become available. (However, antipseudomonal coverage should typically continue until absolute neutrophil count [ANC] recovers to >500 cells/mm3.)
- Patients who remain unstable after initial standard neutropenic-fever management should have their regimen broadened to include coverage for resistant gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria and fungi.
- After 4-7 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics, empiric antifungal coverage should be added in high-risk patients with persistent fever with no documented source. Treatment regimens include micafungin or liposomal amphotericin B and should be decided in conjunction with an infectious disease (ID) consultation.
