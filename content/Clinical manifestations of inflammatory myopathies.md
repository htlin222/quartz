- Muscle weakness:
  - typically gradual onset (wks to mos) but often accelerated in NM (days to wks) and more insidious (yrs) in IBM;
  - progressive and painless
- DM/PM/NM:
  - proximal and symmetric;
  - difficulty climbing stairs, arising from chairs, brushing hair;
  - fine motor skills (eg, buttoning) lost late
- IBM: weakness may be asymmetric, distal, and involve facial muscles
- Skin findings in dermatomyositis: may precede myositis by mos to yrs
  - [[Gottronâ€™s papules]]:
  - [[Heliotrope rash]]:
  - [[Poikiloderma]]:
  - [[Mechanicâ€™s hands]]:
- Pulmonary: acute alveolitis, interstitial lung disease; resp muscle weakness; aspiration
  - [[Antisynthetase syndrome]]
  - MDA5-assoc. DM: â†‘ amyopathic, â†‘ rapidly progressive ILD, palmar papules, skin ulcers
- Cardiac: (33%): often asx;
  - conduction abnl;
  - myo/pericarditis;
  - HF uncommon;
  - â†‘ CK-MB/Tn
