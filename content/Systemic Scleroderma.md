### Systemic Scleroderma

â€¢Â Â Â **Mycophenolate mofetil versus oral cyclophosphamide in scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SLS II Study)**. *Lancet Respir Med* 2016;4:708â€“719.

-Â Â Â Randomized controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial that randomized patients with scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease to receive mycophenolate mofetil (target dose: 1500 mg twice daily) for 24 months or oral cyclophosphamide (target dose: 2.0 mg/kg per day) for 12 months followed by placebo for 12 months. A post hoc analysis demonstrated significant improvements in lung function (in terms of % FVC) for both groups; however mycophenolate mofetil was better tolerated and demonstrated less toxicity.
