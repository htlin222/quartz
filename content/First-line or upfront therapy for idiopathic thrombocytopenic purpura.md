# First-line or upfront therapy for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura

## Steroids:

- prednisone 0.5–2 mg/kg/d PO tapered ~4 wk, or dexamethasone 40 mg PO × 4 d

- ↓ Mϕ FcR & ↓ anti-plt Ab

- 70–90% have initial response

- ~20% sustained remission

## IVIg (1 g/kg/d IV × 2–3 d)

* Consider if need rapid ↑ in plt in 24–48 hrs; lasts 2–6 wks

* Blocks Mϕ FcR, ↓ anti-plt Ab

* Interferes w/ Mϕ uptake Ab-coated plts; 80% have initial response

## Anti-Rh(D) Ig:

* alternative to IVIg if RBC Rh(D) ⊕; 50–75 mcg/kg/d

* Ab-coated RBCs overwhelm Mϕ FcR

* Avoid if h/o hemolysis; not often used
