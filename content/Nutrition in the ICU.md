# Nutrition in the ICU #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at increased risk of malnutrition, and few can feed themselves. Route, timing, rate, and formulation of nutritional support are important to consider.

Enteral nutrition, via a tube directly into the gastrointestinal tract, is the mainstay of nutritional support. Parenteral nutrition, delivered intravenously via peripheral or central vein, is an option for patients unable to be fed enterally.
