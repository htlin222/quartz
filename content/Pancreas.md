### Pancreas

##### Acute pancreatitis

•   Etiology: Premature activation of pancreatic digestive enzymes causes autodigestion of pancreatic tissue

•   Causes: **GET SMASHED** – **G**allstones (40%), **E**tOH (30%), **T**rauma, **S**corpion, **M**umps, **A**utoimmune, **S**teroids, **H**ypertriglyceridemia (>1000 mg/dL)/**H**ypercalcemia, **E**RCP (post-procedure), **D**rugs (sulfonamides, thiazides, lisinopril, furosemide, antiretrovirals)

•   Clinical features:

-   Symptoms: Epigastric pain that radiates to the back, often worse after eating. Also fever, nausea/vomiting

-   Classic signs: Hemorrhagic: 1) Grey Turner (flank ecchymosis), 2) Cullen (periumbilical ecchymosis), 3) Fox (nontraumatic ecchymosis over the inguinal ligament)

•   Diagnosis: Need two of three criteria: 1) Typical pancreatic abdominal pain, 2) Elevation in lipase or amylase >3× ULN, 3) Imaging findings of acute pancreatitis.

•   Prognosis: Multiple scoring systems exist, including the following:

-   BISAP: 5-point score to predict mortality (BUN >25 mg/dL, GCS <15, SIRS, age >60 yr, pleural effusion)

-   Ranson’s criteria: Uses age, admission labs, and labs at 48 hours to predict mortality

•   Treatment:

-   Make patient NPO, administer early aggressive IVF (5–10 cc/kg, Lactated Ringer’s preferred), replete electrolytes, provide pain control

-   Gallstone pancreatitis: Early ERCP, followed by cholecystectomy after recovery

•   Complications:

-   Pancreatic necrosis: If suspect sterile fluid collection, monitor closely, antibiotics controversial. If infection suspected, give IV antibiotics and pursue surgical debridement.

-   Pancreatic pseudocyst: Fluid collection 2–3 weeks after acute pancreatitis. Risk rupture, infection, obstruction. Treatment: Observation if minimal symptoms/no pseudoaneurysm. If symptomatic or rapidly enlarging, drain percutaneously, endoscopically, or surgically.

-   Other complications of acute pancreatitis: ARDS, pancreatic ascites, pleural effusions, ascending cholangitis, ileus, renal failure, hemorrhagic pancreatitis, abdominal compartment syndrome.

##### Chronic pancreatitis

•   Etiology: Persistent inflammation of the pancreas with fibrotic tissue replacing pancreatic parenchyma, leading to endocrine/exocrine dysfunction. Heavy alcohol consumption is the most common cause (>80%); gallstones usually don’t cause chronic pancreatitis. Consider the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in young patients without a history of heavy alcohol use.

•   Clinical features: Chronic intermittent abdominal pain, diabetes, steatorrhea (fat in the stool due to lack of pancreatic enzymes)

•   Diagnosis: CT abd/pelvis or MRCP – calcifications, dilated main pancreatic duct. ERCP is the gold standard but it is not routinely performed. Labs are *not* helpful and lipase/amylase are often normal\!

•   Treatment:

-   Nonoperative: Alcohol and smoking cessation, pain control, pancreatic enzyme supplementation, frequent small low-fat meals

-   Operative: Pancreatojejunostomy (pancreatic duct drainage to decompress the dilated duct), total pancreatectomy with auto-islet cell transplant, or denervation (celiac plexus block)

##### Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP)

•   Subtypes:

-   Type 1 (“lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis”): IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis. Most patients have another concurrent IgG4-related condition, such as sclerosing cholangitis or lymphadenopathy. Often presents as a pancreatic mass or as painless jaundice; can be mistaken for pancreatic cancer.

-   Type 2 (“idiopathic duct–centric chronic pancreatitis”): Much more rare than type 1. IgG4 may be elevated or normal. Sometimes associated with IBD.

•   Clinical features: Abdominal pain, pancreatic mass or enlargement with obstructive jaundice, extrapancreatic manifestations (e.g., IBD, IgG-4 associated cholangitis, lung nodules, Sjogren’s)

•   Diagnosis: **HISORt** criteria (**H**istology, **I**maging, **S**erology \[IgG4 >2× ULN\], **O**ther organ involvement, **R**esponse to steroids **t**herapy). “Sausage-like pancreas” is buzzword for CT findings for AIP.

•   Treatment: Steroids
