# PARADIGM

1. Design:
   - Randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial
   - Multi-center trial conducted at â†£ 197 sites in Japan
   - Tested the effect of adding panitumumab vs bevacizumab to standard first-line chemotherapy
   - Primary endpoint: overall survival
   - Secondary endpoints: progression-free survival, response rate, duration of response, and curative resection rate
2. Number of patients: 823 patients
   - 802 patients in the as-treated population
3. Patients characteristics:
   - Chemotherapy-naive RAS wild-type, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer
   - Median age: 66 years
   - 35.2% women
   - 604 (75.3%) had left-sided tumors
4. Agent:
   - Panitumumab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) or bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody)
   - Given with modified fluorouracil, l-leucovorin, and oxaliplatin ([[mFOLFOX6]]) every 14 days
5. Treatment line: First-line chemotherapy
6. Trial Name: NCT02394795
7. Comparison of two groups (panitumumab vs bevacizumab) in the as-treated population:

| Endpoint                                                | Panitumumab | Bevacizumab | Difference (95% CI)   |
| ---                                                     | ---         | ---         | ---                   |
| Progression-free survival (months) - Left-sided tumors  | 13.1        | 11.9        | 0.2 (-0.27 to 0.67)   |
| Progression-free survival (months) - Overall population | 12.2        | 11.4        | 0.8 (-0.09 to 1.70)   |
| Response rate - Left-sided tumors                       | 80.2%       | 68.6%       | 11.2% (4.4% to 17.9%) |
| Response rate - Overall population                      | 74.9%       | 67.3%       | 7.7% (1.5% to 13.8%)  |
| Duration of response (months) - Left-sided tumors       | 13.1        | 11.2        | 1.9 (-0.14 to 3.94)   |
| Duration of response (months) - Overall population      | 11.9        | 10.7        | 1.2 (-0.18 to 2.62)   |
| Curative resection rate - Left-sided tumors             | 18.3%       | 11.6%       | 6.6% (1.0% to 12.3%)  |
| Curative resection rate - Overall population            | 16.5%       | 10.9%       | 5.6% (1.0% to 10.3%)  |

- Overall survival: Panitumumab vs bevacizumab
  - Left-sided tumors: median overall survival of 37.9 months vs 34.3 months, hazard ratio for death, 0.82 (95.798% CI, 0.68-0.99; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03)
  - Overall population: median overall survival of 36.2 months vs 31.3 months, hazard ratio for death, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.72-0.98; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03)
