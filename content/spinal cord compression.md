# spinal cord compression

 (Continuum 2021;27:163)

* [[Etiologies of spinal cord compression]] 

* Acute: flaccid paraparesis and absent reflexes (“spinal shock”)

* Subacute–chronic: spastic paraparesis and hyperreflexia (upgoing toes ± ankle clonus)

* Posterior column dysfunction in legs (loss of vibratory and/or proprioceptive sense)

* Sensory loss below level of lesion (truncal level ↑ bilateral leg sx is clue for cord process)

# spinal cord compression
Clinical manifestations (Lancet Neuro 2008;7:459)
• Metastases located in vertebral body extend and cause epidural spinal cord compression
• Prostate, breast, and lung cancers are most common, followed by RCC, NHL, myeloma
• Site of involvement: thoracic (60%), lumbar (25%), cervical (15%)
• Signs and symptoms: pain (>95%, precedes neuro Δs), weakness, autonomic dysfunction (urinary retention, ↓ anal sphincter tone), sensory loss
Diagnostic evaluation
• Always take back pain in Pts w/ cancer seriously. Urgent whole-spine MRI; CT if unable.
• Do not wait for neurologic signs to develop before initiating evaluation b/c duration & severity of neuro dysfunction before treatment are best predictors of neurologic outcome
Treatment (NEJM 2017;376:1358)
• Dexamethasone (10 mg IV × 1 STAT, then 4 mg IV or PO q6h)
initiate immediately while awaiting imaging if back pain + neurologic deficits
• Emergent RT or surgical decompression if confirmed compression/neuro deficits
• Surgery + RT superior to RT alone for neuro recovery in solid tumors (Lancet 2005;366:643)
• If pathologic fracture causing compression → surgery; if not surgical candidate → RT
