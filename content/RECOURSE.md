# RECOURSE

1. Design: Phase 3 double-blind study.
2. Number of patients: 800 patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive TAS-102 or placebo.
3. Patients characteristics: patients with refractory colorectal cancer.
4. Agent: TAS-102, an oral agent that combines trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride.
5. Treatment line: refractory colorectal cancer.
6. Trial Name/NCT Number: RECOURSE (NCT01607957).
7. Comparison of two groups in a markdown table:

The primary endpoint of OS was met in 800 patients receiving TAS-102 in the third-line setting versus placebo

- (7.1 months vs 5.3 months, respectively; P <.001). Improvement, albeit slight, was also seen in the second- ary endpoint oî€½ PFS (2.0 months vs 1.7 months;
