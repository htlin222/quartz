# Whatâ€™s Next? of Aldosterone and Treatment-Resistant Hypertension

Among the new therapeutic agents that target the reninâ€“angiotensinâ€“aldosterone system in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension are nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and [antisense oligonucleotide. opens in new tab][17] or [small interfering RNA therapies. opens in new tab][18]. Nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone and esaxerenone have a longer plasma half-life than spironolactone and are specific for the mineralocorticoid receptor, with no evident hormonal side effects.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2213559?fbclid=IwAR0gdEuk4vI_LK4FC1F0OImufYjOb8BOs3sjMiIHRonkXlPOtinBLLhHxxE#">6</a></sup> Antisense oligonucleotides and RNA-interference oligonucleotides that are designed to target the synthesis of angiotensinogen in the liver are under investigation in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2213559?fbclid=IwAR0gdEuk4vI_LK4FC1F0OImufYjOb8BOs3sjMiIHRonkXlPOtinBLLhHxxE#">6</a></sup>

Inhibition of aldosterone synthesis with baxdrostat may expand the possible choices of therapeutic agents for treatment-resistant hypertension. The benefits of inhibiting aldosterone synthesis may also extend beyond treatment-resistant hypertension, because elevated levels of aldosterone have been implicated in the pathobiology of pulmonary hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.
