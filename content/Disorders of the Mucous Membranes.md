### Disorders of the Mucous Membranes

•   Aphthous ulcers (“canker sores”): Painful, shallow oral ulcers with a gray base and a red surrounding halo; if recurrent or severe may suggest underlying disease such as Behçet’s syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or HIV. Treatment: Self-resolves

•   Oral candidiasis: Painful white Non-adherent plaques; risk factors include immunosuppression, DM, and glucocorticoids. Treatment: Azole troches or nystatin swish and swallow

•   Leukoplakia: Adherent white patches in the oral mucosa; pre-malignant lesion. Requires biopsy to rule out dysplasia

•   Erythroplakia: Red mucosal patches; high risk of malignant transformation. Requires biopsy to rule out dysplasia

•   Black hairy tongue: Benign condition due to elongation and defective desquamation of filiform papillae. Treatment: Oral care/hygiene

•   Geographic tongue: Benign condition; presents with migratory smooth red surfaces and white patches on the tongue; may be sporadic, familial, or associated with psoriasis

•   Lichen planus: Erythematous patches with overlying white lacelike pattern (Wickham striae); may be isolated to oral mucosa or can be associated with skin or vulvovaginal lesions. Treatment: Topical glucocorticoids and systemic steroid-sparing agents

•   Lichen sclerosus: White atrophic patches involving the vaginal introitus and perianal area (“figure 8” morphology); typically affects women age 50 to 60 yr. Treatment: Topical glucocorticoids
