# ProceduralSurgical Interventions #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Procedural/Surgical Interventions

Many procedures are done by cardiologists or cardiac surgeons. Some examples include:

â€¢Â Â Â Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): Coronary catheterization can be both diagnostic to identify coronary abnormalities and therapeutic if a stent is placed to allow better coronary perfusion.

â€¢Â Â Â Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG): The main indications for CABG are the presence of triple-vessel coronary disease, severe left main artery stenosis, or severe stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) with concurrent stenosis of the proximal circumflex artery or EF <50%.

â€¢Â Â Â Valve replacement: E.g., surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with aortic stenosis.

â€¢Â Â Â Radiofrequency ablation: Used to disrupt electrical signals that are causing arrhythmia.

â€¢Â Â Â Heart transplantation: The most common indications for heart transplantation are nonischemic cardiomyopathy (~59%) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (~40%).
