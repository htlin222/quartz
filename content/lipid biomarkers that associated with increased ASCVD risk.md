# lipid biomarkers that associated with increased ASCVD risk

Persistently* elevated, primary hypertriglyceridemia (2175 mg/dL); if measured:

1. Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (â‰¥2.0 mg/L) 2 Elevated Lp(a): A relative indication for its measurement is family history of premature ASCVD. An Lp(a) â‰¥50 mg/dL Ol â‰¥125 nmolL constitutes a risk-enhancing factor especially at higher levels of Lp(a).
3. Elevated apoB â‰¥130 mg/dL: A relative indication for its measurement would be triglyceride 2200 mg/dL. A level â‰¥130 mg/ dL corresponds to an LDL-C â‰¥160 mg/dL and constitutes a riskenhancing factor.
4. ABI <0.9
