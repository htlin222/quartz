# aura

Aura is defined as transient focal neurological symptoms that usually precede, but sometimes accompany, the headache phase of a migraine attack. 

## Less common
aphasic speech disturbance, 
brainstem symptoms (such as dysarthria and vertigo), 
motor weakness (in hemiplegic migraine) and 
retinal symptoms (for example, repeated monocular visual disturbances). 

Aura symptoms can be similar to those of transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), but can be differentiated on the basis that aura symptoms often spread gradually (over â‰¥5 min) and occur in succession, 

> whereas symptoms of a TIA have a sudden, simultaneous onset4.
