# CRYSTAL

[Cetuximab and Chemotherapy as Initial Treatment for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer | NEJM](https://www-nejm-org.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa0805019)

There was a significant interaction between treatment group and KRAS mutation status for tumor response (P=0.03) but not for progression-free survival (P=0.07) or overall survival (P=0.44). The hazard ratio for progression-free survival among patients with wild-type-KRAS tumors was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.94), in favor of the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group. The following grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI than with FOLFIRI alone: skin reactions (which were grade 3 only) (in 19.7% vs. 0.2% of patients, P<0.001), infusion-related reactions (in 2.5% vs. 0%, P<0.001), and diarrhea (in 15.7% vs. 10.5%, P=0.008).

1. Design: Randomized controlled trial.
2. Number of patients: Not reported.
3. Patients characteristics: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
4. Agent: Cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone.
5. Treatment line: 1L

| Outcome | Cetuximab plus FOLFIRI | FOLFIRI alone | Hazard Ratio/Relative Risk (95% CI) | P-value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tumor response | Not reported | Not reported | Not reported | 0.03 |
| Progression-free survival | Improved compared to FOLFIRI alone in wild-type-KRAS tumors | Not reported | 0.68 (0.50-0.94) | 0.07 |
| Overall survival | Not different between the two groups | Not reported | Not reported | 0.44 |

Adverse events:

| Adverse Event | Cetuximab plus FOLFIRI | FOLFIRI alone | P-value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skin reactions (grade 3 only) | 19.7% | 0.2% | <0.001 |
| Infusion-related reactions | 2.5% | 0% | <0.001 |
| Diarrhea | 15.7% | 10.5% | 0.008 |
