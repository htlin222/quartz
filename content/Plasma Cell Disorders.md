### Plasma Cell Disorders

A framework for plasma cell disorders:

•   Spectrum of disease: See Figure 7.6

-   Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) (asymptomatic)

-   Smoldering multiple myeloma (asymptomatic): <3g/dL M-spike or 10% plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy

-   Active multiple myeloma

-   Plasma cell leukemia

-   Amyloidosis: Some clones make light chains that are amyloidogenic – can occur with any of the four above

##### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)

•   Pathophysiology: Asymptomatic pre-malignant plasma cell proliferation that typically occurs in elderly patients. See increase in serum protein with M-spike on SPEP, but no other associated symptoms. Fewer than 20% of patients with MGUS develop multiple myeloma (MM), but almost all patients with MM have preceding MGUS.

•   Diagnostic criteria:

-   Serum monoclonal Ig protein (M-spike) <3 g



**FIGURE 7.6: Spectrum of plasma cell dyscrasias**.

-   Bone marrow clonal plasma cells <10%

-   No end organ damage (i.e., no CRAB criteria)

•   Work-up:

-   CBC, CMP, Mg2\+, phosphorus, LDH, total immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM)

-   Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) – *quantifies* a monoclonal abnormal protein (M-spike)

-   Immunofixation (IFE) – *classifies* the abnormal protein

-   Serum free light chain (sFLC) – Detects LOW levels of free light chains in serum, so it can pick up lighter proteins. Note: In CKD, increased K:L ratio up to 3 can be normal due to ↓clearance of FLC

-   UA, urine spot protein/Cr.

-   24hr UPEP – *quantifies* urine M protein, UIFE – *classifies* abnormal protein, urine free light chains (Bence Jones protein)

-   Beta-2-microglobulin: Strong prognostic value but non-specific

-   Skeletal survey (long bones, skull) to rule out lytic lesions suggesting multiple myeloma. Alternatively, can consider low dose whole body CT scan or MRIs.

•   Treatment: None needed, observation. Monitoring depends on risk factors (Ig type, M-spike, light chains).

##### Multiple myeloma (MM)

•   Pathophysiology: Malignant proliferation of a single plasma cell line that makes a monoclonal immunoglobulin – most often large amounts IgG or IgA

•   Clinical features: Often patients in 60s with fractures or bone pain

-   Diagnostic criteria = **SLiM-CRAB**

**•**   **S**ixty percent plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy

**•**   Serum Free **Li**ght chain ratio >100

**•**   **M**RI with >1 focal lesion (plasmacytoma)

**•**   Hyper**C**alcemia (>10.5 mg/dL)

**•**   **R**enal insufficiency (immunoglobulins precipitate in renal tubules - Bence Jones protein, Cr >2mg/dL without an alternative diagnosis)

**•**   **A**nemia (Hgb<10 g/dL without an alternative diagnosis)

**•**   **B**ony disease (“punched out” lytic bone lesions or osteoporosis). Bone pain most common presenting symptom.

-   Other clinical features:

**•**   Amyloidosis: Kappa chain accumulation → carpal tunnel syndrome


**TABLE 7.4** • R-ISS Staging for Multiple Myeloma: Criteria and Prognosis




**•**   Infection: Lack of immunoglobulin diversity can lead to increased risk of infection

•   Diagnosis: Need labs (SPEP, SFLC), imaging (usually PET/CT), and bone marrow biopsy

-   Serum monoclonal protein present (M-spike >3g)

-   Bone marrow clonal plasma cells >10%

-   End organ damage present (i.e., SLiM-CRAB)

-   Other common findings:↑ESR, ↑serum protein. Smear: RBC = Rouleaux (“stacks of RBCs” – RBCs stick together due to increased plasma proteins)

•   Staging: Revised-International Staging System (R-ISS): Uses Beta-2-microglobulin, albumin, LDH, and chromosomal abnormalities to predict overall and progression-free survival at 5 yr. See Table 7.4.

•   Treatment: Typically, chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant

-   Classes of therapy:

**•**   Proteasome inhibitors: Bortezomib, carfilzomib

**•**   Immunomodulatory agents: Lenalidomide

**•**   Monoclonal Antibody: Daratumumab (anti-CD38 targeting MM cells)

-   Common regimens:

**•**   Hyper CD (cyclophosphamide \+ dexamethasone) – commonly used for rapid reduction in patients with a high disease burden

**•**   RVD: lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade), dexamethasone

**•**   KRD: carfilzomid (Kyprolis), lenalidomide (Revlimid), dexamethasone

**•**   Daratumumab, lenalidomide, dexamethasone

##### Waldenström macroglobulinemia

•   Pathophysiology: Malignant clonal proliferation of IgM producing plasmacytoid lymphocytes

•   Clinical features: Similar to MM, but IgM protein is larger and “stickier,” so it causes more symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome (up to 30% of patients). Cold cryoglobulinemia in 10% of patients.

•   Treatment: Plasmapheresis may be needed to emergently manage hyperviscosity. Treatment usually includes rituximab.

##### AL amyloidosis

•   Pathophysiology: Immunoglobulin light chain amyloid from malignant clonal proliferation of plasma cells (e.g., MM, Waldenström). The proteins deposit in tissues and cause end organ damage.

•   Clinical features: Nephrotic syndrome, restrictive cardiomyopathy, neuropathy

•   Diagnosis: Biopsy (often fat pad biopsy) to look for deposition of amyloid protein. SPEP will show an M-spike and serum free light chains will show an abnormal sFLC ratio.

•   Treatment: Treat underlying plasma cell disorder. Consider autologous stem cell transplant.
