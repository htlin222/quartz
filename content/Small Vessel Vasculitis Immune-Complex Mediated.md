### Small Vessel Vasculitis: Immune-Complex Mediated

Palpable purpura on exam, leukocytoclastic vasculitis on skin biopsy

##### Cryglobulinemic vasculitis

•   Pathogenesis: Immune complex-mediated small vessel vasculitis caused by Ig molecules that precipitate at temperatures lower than 37ºC, known as cryoglobulins. Types of cryoglobulins:

-   Type I – IgM rheumatoid factor associated with multiple myeloma

-   Type II and III – “Mixed cryoglobulinemia” because the precipitating antibodies are a mixture of polyclonal IgG and either:

**•**   Polyclonal IgM rheumatoid factor (Type II)

**•**   Monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor (Type III)

•   Diagnosis:

-   90% of cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia are associated with HCV infection (test for HCV if cryos are identified\!), but SLE and Sjögren’s can also cause Type III

-   Additional lab findings include \+Rf and very low C4

-   Pearl about sample collection: Must keep at >37°C to avoid premature precipitation and false negative result

•   Clinical features:

-   **Derm** (70–90%): Palpable purpura, Raynaud’s, ulcers, skin necrosis, livedo reticularis

-   **Neuro** (60%): Distal symmetric polyneuropathy

-   Arthritis (40%)

-   **Renal** (40%): Immune complex glomerulonephritis

•   Treatment:

-   Treat HCV or control the underlying rheumatic disease (e.g., Sjögren’s or SLE)

-   For organ-threatening disease such as acute renal failure, plasmapheresis or glucocorticoids plus rituximab or cyclophosphamide are options

##### IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura, HSP)

•   Epidemiology: Childhood vasculitis that rarely occurs in adults with incidence of 14/million individuals annually

•   Clinical features: Often preceded by viral URI or strep pharyngitis. Main manifestations include small vessel luminal vasculitis causing abdominal pain, GIB (65%), arthritis and arthralgias (63%) and glomerulonephritis (40%).

•   Diagnosis: Gold standard is skin biopsy with leukocytoclastic vasculitis and heavy IgA deposits, or renal biopsy showing IgA nephropathy

•   Treatment:

-   Self-limited in children

-   Adults may require glucocorticoids and/or cyclophosphamide for severe organ-threatening disease

##### Hypersensitivity vascultiis

•   Clinical features: A small vessel vasculitis with isolated cutaneous involvement (palpable purpura) triggered by exposure to a known or unknown antigen

•   Diagnosis:

-   Skin biopsy shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis without IgA staining in the correct clinical context

-   Typically, the vasculitis will resolve 7–10 days after removal of the offending antigen. Persistent symptoms for more than a month should raise suspicion for the presence of an alternative diagnosis

•   Treatment: Removal of the offending antigen
