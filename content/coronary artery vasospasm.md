# coronary artery vasospasm

- The underlying mechanism of coronary vasospasm is â†’ likely the result of
  - endothelial dysfunction
  - caused by 5-FU and its active metabolites.
- Endothelial dysfunction is â†’ thought to be due to an increase in the release of
  - endothelin-1, a vasoconstrictor,
  - decrease in the release of prostacyclin, a vasodilatator

- [5-FU-Associated Coronary Vasospasm: Who is â†’ Really at â†£ Risk? - American College of Cardiology](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2021/08/31/12/53/5-fu-associated-coronary-vasospasm)
- In the largest single-center retrospective cohort of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) associated coronary vasospasm,
  - younger patients with lower rates of baseline cardiovascular risk factors were at â†£ a higher risk of developing coronary vasospasm.
- The 5-FU dose received by patients with vasospasm was significantly lower than that for patients without vasospasm;
  - however, there was no significant difference in progression-free or overall survival among patients with coronary vasospasm compared with those who did not develop vasospasm.
- Younger patients may require closer monitoring
  - and lower threshold for workup of any chest discomfort in the setting of 5-FU therapy.
