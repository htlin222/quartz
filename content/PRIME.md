# PRIME

[Final results from PRIME: randomized phase III study of panitumumab with FOLFOX4 for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer - PubMed](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/24718886/)

- Design: Phase III, randomized, multicenter trial
- Number of patients: 1183
- Patients characteristics: previously untreated wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer
- Agent: panitumumab-FOLFOX4 (arm 1) or FOLFOX4 alone (arm 2)
- Treatment line: first-line
- Trial Name/NCT Number: NCT00364013

| Group | Progression-free survival (PFS) | Overall survival (OS) | Response rate (RR) |
|-------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Arm 1 | 10.0 months                     | 23.9 months           | Higher objective response |
| Arm 2 | 8.6 months                      | 19.7 months           | not reported         |

- Other findings:
  - An exploratory analysis of updated survival showed significant improvement in OS for arm 1
  - Adverse event profile consistent with primary analysis

- Summary: The PRIME study demonstrated that panitumumab-FOLFOX4 significantly improved PFS and OS in patients with previously untreated wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer, with a higher objective response rate. These data
