**FIGURE 5.4: Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and adrenal hormone production.** A) Shown is the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, which regulates the production of adrenal hormones. ACTH activates the production of androgens, cortisol, and aldosterone in the adrenal gland. Aldosterone production is also regulated by the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). Green arrows indicate stimulatory actions, and red lines indicate inhibitory actions. B) The adrenal gland consists of the outer cortex and the inner medulla. The cortex is further divided into three layers: the glomerulosa, the fasciculata, and the reticularis. Each of these layers produces different hormones, as shown. Abbreviations: CRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone; VP, vasopressin; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.
