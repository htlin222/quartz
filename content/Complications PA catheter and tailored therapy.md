# Complications PA catheter and tailored therapy

* Central venous access: pneumo/hemothorax (~1%), arterial puncture (if inadvertent cannulation w/ dilation → surgical/endovasc eval), air embolism, thoracic duct injury

* Advancement: atrial or ventricular arrhythmias (3% VT; 20% NSVT and >50% PVC), RBBB (5%), catheter knotting, cardiac perforation/tamponade, PA rupture

* Maintenance: infection (espec if catheter >3 d old), thrombus, pulm infarction (≤1%), valve/chordae damage, PA rupture/pseudoaneurysm (espec w/ PHT), balloon rupture
