# Histology and molecular biology-of-renal-cell-carcinoma

- Clear cell (ccRCC; 80-90% of all RCC).
  - Remainder non-clear cell include:
    - papillary,
    - FH-deficient,
    - chromophobe
    - collecting duct,
    - medullary,
    - TFE3 translocation,
    - & unclassified
- Sarcomatoid is a variant seen w/ any cell type reflecting a phenotype that is more aggressive but possibly more responsive to immunotherapy
