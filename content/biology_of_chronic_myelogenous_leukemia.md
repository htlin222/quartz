# biology_of_chronic_myelogenous_leukemia


- [[philadelphia_chromosome.md|Philadelphia chromosome]]
- Three types of fusion proteins based on location of breakpoint in BCR gene:
    - p210: 
        - Classic breakpoint (>95% of pts); (also seen in 30% Ph+ ALL)
    - p230: 
        - Alternative breakpoint; found in only rare cases (<1%)
    - p190: 
        - Also rare (<1%); (common breakpoint in Ph+ ALL, 70%)
- A minority of pts (<5%) may harbor a variant translocation (eg, t(9;14;22)) 
    - â†’ testing at dx by both cytogenetics (karyotype, FISH) & molecular (PCR) important; 
    - need to confirm fusion type (eg, p210) & splice type (e13 vs. e14a2) â†’ impact on response
