# Regional Lymph Nodes-of-Staging of breast cancer

- N1 (1-3 axillary nodes)
- N2 (4-9 axillary nodes)
- N3 (≥10 axillary nodes or any infraclavicular or ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes);

## The regional lymph nodes are

1. Axillary (ipsilateral): interpectoral (Rotter) nodes and lymph nodes along the axillary
vein and its tributaries, which may be divided into the following levels:
    - (i) Level I (low-axilla): lymph nodes lateral to the lateral border of pectoralis minor muscle.
    - (ii) Level II (mid-axilla): lymph nodes between the medial and lateral borders of the pectoralis minor muscle and the interpectoral (Rotter) lymph nodes.
    - (iii) Level III (apical axilla): apical lymph nodes and those medial to the medial margin of the pectoralis minor muscle, excluding those designated as subclavicular or infraclavicular.
2. Infraclavicular (subclavicular) (ipsilateral).
3. Internal mammary (ipsilateral): lymph nodes in the intercostal spaces along the edge
of the sternum in the endothoracic fascia.
4. Supraclavicular (ipsilateral).

> 可以 ✖ 不可以 ✔ 動很重要，黏住算N2

- NX Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (e.g., previously removed)
- N0 No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N(i): micrometastasis 0.2mm, less than 200cell/hpf
- N1 : movable ipsilateral level I, II axillary lymph node(s) (Fig. 327)
- N2 : ipsilateral level I, II axillary lymph node(s) that are clinically fixed or matted; or in clinically detected* ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) in
- the absence of clinically evident axillary lymph node metastasis
  - N2a : axillary lymph node(s) fixed to one another (matted) or to other structures (Fig. 328)
  - N2b : only in clinically detected* internal mammary lymph node(s) and in the absence of clinically evident axillary lymph node metastasis (Fig. 329)
- N3 : ipsilateral infraclavicular (level III axillary) lymph node(s) with or without level I, II axillary lymph node involvement; or in clinically detected* ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) with clinically evident level I, II axillary lymph node metastasis; or : ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s) with or without axillary or internal mammary lymph node involvement
  - N3a : infraclavicular lymph node(s) (Fig. 330)
  - N3b : internal mammary and axillary lymph nodes (Fig. 331)
  - N3c : supraclavicular lymph node(s) (Fig. 332)
