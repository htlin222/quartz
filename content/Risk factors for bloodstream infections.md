# Risk factors for bloodstream infections

(JAMA 2012;308:502; CID;2020;71)
* Syndromes with high likelihood of bacteremia:
Sepsis
Endovascular infxns: endocarditis, infection of pacemaker, vascular graft or IV catheter
[[vertebral osteomyelitis]], epidural abscess, septic arthritis
* Risk factors: indwelling lines, IVDU, immunosupp. (neutropenic, transplant)
* Organisms
More likely pathogenic: S. aureus, β-hemolytic strep, enterococci, GNR, S. pneumo, Neisseria, Candida
Less likely pathogenic: coag-neg staph, diphtheroids, [[Cutibacterium]]
* Time to growth: <24 h → higher risk, >72 h → lower risk (except slow-growing, eg, HACEK)
* Factors increasing likelihood of endocarditis: high-grade bacteremia w/o source, persisting after line removal or drainage of focal source, in hosts at risk for endocarditis or w/ organisms known to cause IE; emboli
