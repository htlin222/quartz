# Complications of familial hypercholesterolemia
People who have familial hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of heart disease and death at a younger age. Heart attacks may occur before **age 50** in men and **age 60** in women. The rarer and more severe variety of the condition, if undiagnosed or untreated, can cause death before age 20.
