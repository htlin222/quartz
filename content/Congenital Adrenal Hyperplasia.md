### Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

##### 21-hydroxylase deficiency

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Most common congenital adrenal hyperplasia (90% cases). Depending on the severity of enzyme deficiency, there is **classic CAH** (which is further subdivided into virilizing or salt-wasting forms) and **nonclassic CAH**. Enzyme deficiency causes an inability to produce cortisol (and aldosterone in the salt-wasting forms), which leads to low cortisol, low or normal aldosterone, and high ACTH, and thus to increased adrenal stimulation which results in high DHEA.

-Â Â Â Classic CAH

**â€¢**Â Â Â More severe form

**â€¢**Â Â Â Virilizing features: XX karyotype: Ambiguous genitalia, normal ovaries/uterus, XY karyotype: Precocious puberty

**â€¢**Â Â Â Salt-wasting: Hypotension, hyperkalemia because of lack of aldosterone; emesis/dehydration in first 2â€“4 weeks of life

-Â Â Â Nonclassic CAH

**â€¢**Â Â Â More mild form

**â€¢**Â Â Â Presents later in life with signs of androgen excess and without neonatal genital ambiguity; some patients are asymptomatic

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: High levels of 17-OH progesterone, which is the normal substrate for 21-hydroxylase (test for stimulated levels)

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Administer steroids and mineralocorticoids, which turn off excess ACTH via a negative feedback loop. Can consider surgical correction of female genitalia, if abnormal.

##### 17-hydroxylase deficiency

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Hypertension, hypokalemia. XX karyotype: Phenotypic female, lack of secondary sexual development. XY karyotype: Complete male pseudohermaphorditism; characterized by external female genitalia with a blind-ending vagina but without a uterus or fallopian tubes.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: High aldosterone, low cortisol, low DHEA

##### 11-hydroxylase deficiency

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Hypertension, hypokalemia. XX karyotype: Labial fusion. XY karyotype: Precocious puberty.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Low aldosterone, low cortisol, high DHEA
