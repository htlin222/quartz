# management_nonmetastatic_disease_of_anal_cancer

- 1st line:
  - [[nigro_protocol.md|Nigro Protocol]] in 1970s established chemoRT as standard compared to APR; chemoRT is superior to RT (JCO 1997;15:2040)
  - Chemo:
    - Capecitabine + MMC or infusional 5-FU + MMC.
    - Infusional 5-FU w/ bolus MMC as above (JCO 1996;14:2527).
    - Capecitabine, Mon‚ÄìFri on days of RT, also widely used based on retrospective data (Br J Cancer 2014;111:1726) & other small studies. 5-FU + cis may be considered if MMC contraindicated
- Radiation:
  - Dosing of ‚â§59 Gy is sufficient,
  - w/ no additional benefit to high-dose RT or induction chemo (ACCORD-03, JCO 2009;27:4033);
  - Rx breaks should be minimized, but may be necessary due to
    - acute anoproctitis,
    - perineal dermatitis, or cytopenia.
  - Chronic adverse effects may include anal ulcers, stenosis, & necrosis
- IMRT:
  - ‚Üì Tox & effective (J Radiat Oncol 2012;1:165); IMRT is acceptable only at experienced centers (must avoid ‚Äúmarginal-miss‚Äù ‚Üì in local control)
- 3-fold ‚Üë pelvic fracture risk in women s/p RT
- Women should be considered for vaginal dilator to reduce vaginal stenosis
- Post-Rx follow-up:
  - DRE 8‚Äì12 weeks after Rx.
  - If regression w/o CR,
    - repeat DRE in 4 wks.
  - Pts w/ persistent dz may be followed for up to 6 mos, provided there is no progression.
  - If CR,
    - repeat DRE, inguinal exam q3‚Äì6mos for 5 y, anoscopy every 6‚Äì12 mos for 3 y, annual CT C/A/P for 3 y
- HIV pts w/ adequate T4 counts & undetectable viral load should be treated w/ same protocols.
  - Data suggests similar ORR & OS but ‚Üë skin tox & local relapse
