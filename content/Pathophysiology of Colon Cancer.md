# Pathophysiology of Colon Cancer

- Adenoma-CA sequence:
  - Most common pathway, adenomas on avg take 10 y to develop (Cell 1990;61:759).
  - Accumulation of genetic muts (APC â†’ TP53, KRAS, SMAD4, etc.) leads to tumorigenesis; usu a/w chromosomal instability (CIN); risk of CRC â†‘ w/ adenoma size, number, & histology (villous > tubular)

- Serrated polyp pathway:
  - Alternative route for CRC development through serrated adenomas;
  - BRAF mut & [[CpG Island Methylation Phenotype]] (CIMP);
  - hypermethylation of promoters of MMR genes such as MLH1 & tumor suppressors â†’ gene silencing
