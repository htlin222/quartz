# Management of Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction

*   [Conservative management][13] for 48-72 hours is the preferred initial management if cecal diameter is < 12 cm and there are no signs of ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis ([Strong recommendation][14]) which includes:
    *   nothing by mouth
    *   intravenous hydration and/or correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances
    *   discontinuation of narcotic, sedative, calcium-channel blocker, or anticholinergic medications
    *   placement of nasogastric tube for proximal intestinal decompression
    *   aggressive use of body positioning and ambulation
    *   placement of rectal tube (with or without use of limited tap water enemas)
*   With conservative management, monitor the patient every 12-24 hours for electrolytes, leukocyte count, and cecal diameter (with supine and dependent abdominal x-ray) and treat any emergent complications.
*   Give [neostigmine][15] 2 mg IV over 3-5 minutes (with cardiac monitoring) in patients with intestinal psuedo-obstruction who have failed conservative therapy, are at risk for perforation, and have no contraindications ([Strong recommendation][16]).
*   Consider octreotide to stimulate motility, but may worsen gastroparesis.
*   In patients with contraindications to neostigmine and those failing other medical management (prokinetics or octreotide), consider [colonoscopy with decompression tube][17] placement ([Weak recommendation][18]).
*   Consider [prokinetic agents][19], such as metoclopramide, erythromycin, or prucalopride, but they are not clearly shown to be beneficial and their use is limited by adverse effects and drug interactions.
*   In patients with SIBO, consider rifaximin 550 mg 3 times daily for 14 days.
*   [Surgery][20] should be used in patients with overt perforation or signs of peritonitis ([Strong recommendation][21]).
*   For patients unresponsive to maximal pharmacological and endoscopic therapy but also considered unfit for surgery, consider percutaneous endoscopic colostomy of the cecum as an alternate method of decompression.
*   Consider venting/feeding gastrostomy and/or jejunostomy patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or isolated small bowel or multivisceral transplantation in patients who develop life threatening total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-associated complications such as intestinal failure associated liver disease.
