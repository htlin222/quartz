# Ambulatory Care - Chronic Pain and Opioids - Fast Facts | NEJM Resident 360
Caring for patients with chronic non–cancer-related pain remains challenging. In many areas of the United States, increased rates of opioid misuse and overdose have led to restrictions on prescribing opioids. Health care providers (including residents) need to understand and utilize evidence-based treatments for patients with chronic pain, reducing opioid prescriptions where possible while ensuring safer prescribing when indicated.

In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released an important guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic noncancer and nonpalliative pain.

### Key Principles for Assessing Chronic Pain

*   Begin with a thorough physical examination and history. Key portions of the history include: previous therapies; exacerbating and alleviating features; duration and severity; location; mechanism of any previous injuries; and presence of alarm features, including but not limited to neurologic deficits, fevers, and weight loss.
    
*   Review the patient’s functional status, including activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living.
    
*   Screen for comorbid mood disorders and substance use disorders.  
      
    

### Key Principles for Managing Chronic Pain

*   A multimodal treatment strategy is the foundation of chronic pain management. Nonpharmacologic therapy (physical therapy, exercise therapy, weight loss, and cognitive behavioral techniques), nonopioid pharmacologic therapy (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], certain antidepressants, and anticonvulsants), and interventional approaches (injections) are preferred first-line options for chronic pain.
    
*   Consider a trial of opioids if the benefits of treating a patient’s pain and function are anticipated to outweigh the risks.
    
*   When prescribing opioids:
    
*   *   Where appropriate, combine with nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy.
        
    *   Start with immediate-release opioids at the lowest effective dosage (“start low, go slow”).
        
    *   Avoid prescribing opioids with concomitant benzodiazepines.
        
    *   Establish treatment goals, including realistic goals for what pain control can be achieved and an anticipated timeline for weaning opioids, in a structured patient–provider agreement.
        
    *   Schedule frequent face-to-face visits to assess the risks and benefits of therapy, do random urine drug testing and pill counts to evaluate for misuse or diversion, and use a structured assessment of adverse effects and functional improvements at each visit.
        
    *   Review state prescription-drug–monitoring programs.
        
    *   Consider offering naloxone to those at increased risk for overdose.
        
    *   Ensure the patient is placed on a bowel regimen and monitored for opioid-induced constipation.
        

### Opioid Therapy

Opioids are not first-line therapy for chronic non–cancer-related pain because of their potential risks, lack of evidence of long-term efficacy, and the possibility of tolerance or hyperalgesia. However, opioids may be appropriate on a trial basis for patients with chronic pain if the following conditions are met:

*   The pain is severe and has a significant effect on function and quality of life.
    
*   The pain has not responded favorably to other appropriate interventions, or the other available interventions represent higher risk (e.g., NSAIDs in a patient with chronic kidney disease).
    
*   The benefits of opioid therapy are expected to outweigh the risks.  
      
    

Opioids are a mainstay for severe cancer pain, where they can help achieve pain control in 70% to 90% of patients. They are also beneficial for symptom control in palliative and end-of-life care.

**When initiating opioid therapy consider the following steps:**

1. Determine whether there is an indication for opioid therapy

2. Establish clear functional goals with the patient. Goals should be SMART:

*   **S**pecific about what the patient will set out to do
    
*   **M**easurable, so that you and the patient can determine whether the goal has been met
    
*   **A**ction-oriented (rather than passive)
    
*   **R**ealistic with respect to the patient’s current condition
    
*   **T**ime-bound, so that the goal is being measured within a very specific time frame
    

3. Plan to continue nonopioid medications for complementary and synergistic effects as helpful

4. Assess the potential risks of opioid therapy, including:

*   risk of misuse
    
*   medical risks, such as sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, renal or hepatic dysfunction, or use of other central nervous system (CNS) depressants
    

5. Consider referral to an appropriate specialist if you identify a high risk of misuse or a need for interventional pain management

6. Institute a patient–provider agreement. Such agreements typically outline the following:

*   The planned frequency of follow-up visits to assess pain, function, adverse effects, and progress toward established goals; follow-up is typically at least every 4 weeks initially, progressing to at least every 3 months
    
*   Review of all medications in the planned regimen, including name, dose, frequency, and instructions for taking the medication
    
*   Review of risky medication-associated behaviors, such as requesting early refills or obtaining refills for controlled substances from other providers
    
*   Tools to be used for risk monitoring, such as urine drug testing, pill counts, and reports from the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP)
    

7. Provide an at-home naloxone rescue kit

8. For opioid-naive patients, start with a short-acting agent:

*   in general, initiate these agents at a low dose and keep at the lowest dose possible
    
*   exercise caution with dosing in patients with risks, incuding obstructive sleep apnea, hepatic or renal dysfunction, or concomitant use of other CNS depressants.
    

Once a patient has been taking a short-acting opioid for at least one week, he or she may transition to an extended-release/long-acting opioid.

**Drug-drug interactions:** Clinicians should be aware of potential drug-drug interactions prior to initiating opioid therapy. Certain opioids, such as fentanyl, codeine, oxycodone, methadone, and tramadol, are metabolized by the liver’s cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzymes. Medications that inhibit the CYP450 pathway have the potential to reduce the clearance of these opioids and lead to dangerous dose accumulation, thus placing the patient at risk for unintentional opioid overdose. Several types of medications should be avoided in the setting of opioid therapy because of potentiating effects on sedation and respiratory depression including:

*   benzodiazepines
    
*   sedative hypnotics
    
*   tricyclic antidepressants
    
*   monoamine oxidase inhibitors  
      
    

**Monitoring response:** The patient’s response to therapy should be assessed at each follow up appointment. A validated pain assessment scale should be used to assist in response to treatment assessment. One example is the PEG scale, which assesses pain across three dimensions:

*   **P**ain intensity
    
*   **E**njoyment of life
    
*   **G**eneral activity level  
      
    

**Adverse effects:** Patients should be monitored for adverse effects of opioid therapy including:

*   constipation
    
*   urinary retention
    
*   psychomotor Impairment
    
*   cognitive Impairment
    
*   itch, nausea and vomiting  
      
    

If an adverse effect persists, general management approaches include:

*   reducing the opioid dose
    
*   switching to an alternative opioid (known as opioid rotation)
    
*   treating the adverse effect with medication if needed  
      
    

**Rotating opioids:** When patients rotate opioids, they generally take a lower dose and often experience fewer adverse effects with an equivalent analgesic response. In addition, because of unpredictable cross-tolerance, patients may develop sedation and overdose (or pain and withdrawal) on the new opioid. Therefore, caution and careful monitoring are advised.

### Fibromyalgia

Fibromyalgia is a well-defined chronic pain syndrome with a prevalence of 2% to 4%. It is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain for at least 3 months in the absence of any inflammatory or metabolic cause and remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. It also often involves some combination of chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, depressed mood, anxiety, headaches, and digestive problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) established diagnostic criteria in 1990 and 2010, with a slight revision in 2016 to include a generalized pain criterion.

*   1990 ACR diagnostic criteria: at least 11 out of 18 positive tender points
    
*   2016 ACR diagnostic criteria: a widespread pain index ≥7 and a symptom severity scale score ≥5 or a widespread pain index 3–6 and a symptom severity scale score ≥9; patients must have pain symptoms in ≥4 of 5 regions.  
      
    

Treatment of fibromyalgia involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy (e.g., graded exercise, meditation, and cognitive behavioral techniques). The three FDA-approved medications for fibromyalgia are duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin. Gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants are also frequently used. Opioids are not recommended.
