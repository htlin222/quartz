# aldosterone synthetic pathway

Figure: ![🏞️](https://i.imgur.com/n41oLdK.png)

* adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) , angiotensin II (Ang II) , and K + regulate steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) , which stimulates cholesterol uptake by mitochondria and thus substrate availability for synthesis of all of the steroid hormones.
* Aldosterone synthase (gene name, CYP11B2 ), which is selectively expressed in the adrenal glomerulosa, mediates the final step in aldosterone synthesis.
* It is also regulated by Ang II and K + .
* Aldosterone synthesis is shown on the left .
* Cortisol synthesis is also shown (right) to emphasize the interconnections and similarities between these pathways.
