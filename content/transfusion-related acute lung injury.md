# transfusion-related acute lung injury

: non-cardiogenic pulm. edema due to donor allo-Abs (from multiparous ♀ plasma) binding recipient WBCs, which then aggregate in pulmonary vasculature and release mediators causing ↑ capillary permeability. Rx: see “ARDS.” No longer seen in US as plasma only from ♂ donors.
