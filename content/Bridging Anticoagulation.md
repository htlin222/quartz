### Bridging Anticoagulation

â€¢Â Â Â **Bleeding, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and mortality risks during warfarin interruption for invasive procedures**. *JAMA Int Med* 2015;175(7):1163â€“1168.

-Â Â Â Retrospective cohort study that evaluated 1178 patients on warfarin who underwent procedures with or without bridging anticoagulation. There was no significant difference in the rate of recurrent VTE between the bridge and non-bridge therapy groups (0 vs. 3; p=0.56). No deaths occurred in either group but there was increased rate of bleeding in the bridging anticoagulation group.

â€¢Â Â Â **Perioperative bridging anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation**. *N Engl J Med* 2015;373(9):823â€“833.

-Â Â Â Multicenter randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial that randomized patients with atrial fibrillation on warfarin who underwent perioperative interruption to receive bridging anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin vs. placebo from 3 days before the procedure until 24 hours before the procedure and then for 5â€“10 days after the procedure. Forgoing bridging anticoagulation was non-inferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and decreased the risk of major bleeding events.
