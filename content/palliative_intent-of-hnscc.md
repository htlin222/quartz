# palliative_intent-of-hnscc

- For distant mets or recurrent dz s/p RT that is unresectable or ineligible for more RT
- 1st-line preferred: 
    - Platinum-doublet (CIS/carbo + 5-FU) with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 (+) tumors with CPS â‰¥1. Both regimens demonstrated OS advantage over EXTREME; no PFS advantage ([[keynote-048.md|KEYNOTE-048]], Lancet 2019;349;1915)
- Historically & alternatively: 
    - EXTREME (CIS/carbo + 5-FU with cetuximab) was the 1st-line regimen due to improved efficacy with addition of cetuximab to platinum doublet ([[extreme.md|EXTREME]], NEJM 2008;359:1116)
    - also look at [[tpextreme.md|TPExtreme]]
- Cetuximab tox: 
    - Acneiform rash (correlates w/ response), GI complaints, hypersensitivity rxn
- 2nd-line (if not previously used): Nivolumab & pembrolizumab following progression on or after platinum therapy
    - [[checkmate_141.md|CheckMate 141]]
