# What neoadjuvant systemic therapy regimens are recommended for patients with TNBC

- Patients with TNBC who have clinically node-positive and/or at least T1c disease should be offered an anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen in the neoadjuvant setting (Type: evidence-based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
- Patients with cT1a or cT1bN0 TNBC should not routinely be offered neoadjuvant therapy outside of a clinical trial (Type: evidence-based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
- Carboplatin may be offered as part of a neoadjuvant regimen in patients with TNBC to increase likelihood of pCR. The decision to offer carboplatin should take into account the balance of potential benefits and harms (Type: evidence-based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
- There is insufficient evidence to recommend routinely adding the immune checkpoint inhibitors to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage TNBC (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
