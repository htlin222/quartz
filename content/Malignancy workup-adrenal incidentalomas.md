## Malignancy workup-adrenal incidentalomas

- CT and MRI characteristics may suggest adenoma vs. carcinoma
- Benign features:
  - unenhanced CT <10 Hounsfield units or CT contrast-medium washout >50% at 10 min
  - size <4 cm
  - smooth margins, homogenous and hypodense appearance
  - can follow such incidentalomas w/ periodic scans
- Suspicious features:
  - size ≥4 cm or ↑ size on repeat scan;
  - \>10 Hounsfield units on CT, irregular margins, heterogeneous, dense or vascular appearance;
  - h/o malignancy or young age.
  - Such incidentalomas warrant resection or repeat scan at short interval.
- Rule out metastatic cancer (and infection) in Pts w/ h/o cancer; ~50% of adrenal incidentalomas are malignant
