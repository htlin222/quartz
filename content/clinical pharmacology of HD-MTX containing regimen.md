# clinical pharmacology of HD-MTX containing regimen

- MTX enters the cell using the same carrier protein that transports natural folates and leucovorin.
- Reduced or absent transport capability in some tumors allows MTX to enter the cell through passive diffusion due to high extracellular concentrations.
- Folate binding proteins, which may be more abundant in malignant cells than in normal cells, can mediate MTX entry through endocytosis.
