# esophageal cancer

## OVERALL BOTTOM LINE

- The incidence of esophageal cancer has increased in certain populations (e.g. adenocarcinoma in patients with undertreated reflux esophagitis) without much improvement in survival over the past three decades. Five-year survival for all stages is 18%.
- Esophageal cancer bears a large financial burden on the healthcare system, with $1.6 billion spent in 2014 on patients with esophageal cancer in the USA.
- The management of esophageal cancer from initial diagnosis through completion of treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving gastroenterologists, surgeons, and medical and radiation oncologists.
- Multimodality treatment for locally advanced disease generally involves chemoradiation with or without esophagectomy. Additional adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation is considered in certain cases.
- Surgical and nonsurgical options may be appropriate depending on the depth of tumor and/or extent of disease. For example, endoscopic treatment such as endomucosal resection or ablation are appropriate for some early stage tumors.
