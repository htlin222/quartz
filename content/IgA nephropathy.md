# IgA nephropathy

(CJASN 2017;12:677; AJKD 2021;78:429)

* Most common cause of GN; ♂ pred; peak incidence 20–30s; can also be post-infectious
* Wide range of clinical presentations: asx hematuria (30–40%), gross hematuria ~1–3 d after URI (10–15%), chronic GN (10%), nephrotic syndrome (5%), RPGN (<5%)
* Though clinical presentation can be highly suggestive, definitive dx only w/ bx
* Prognosis: ↑Cr, HTN, proteinuria a/w poor prog. (AJKD 2012;59:865). 20–40% ESRD w/in 20 y.
* Rx: ACEI/ARB; if persistent proteinuria (> 1g/d), clinical trial enrollment or shared decision for steroids, consider SGLT2i (NEJM 2020;383:1436); ± cytotoxic Rx for GN; ? fish oil

# IgA vasculitis

(formerly [[Henoch-Schönlein purpura]] [HSP]) ([Rheumatol 2019;58:1607](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article-abstract/58/9/1607/5382174))
* IgA-mediated [[small-vessel vasculitis]] w/ predilection for skin, GI tract, and kidneys
* Epidemiology: incidence 140/million/y; ♂ >♀, children >adults, winter >summer
* May develop ~10 d after onset of upper resp infx or after drug exposure
* [[Clinical manifestations of IgA vasculitis]]
* Dx studies: skin bx w/ immunofluorescence → leukocytoclastic vasculitis w/ IgA
and C3 deposition in vessel wall; renal bx → mesangial IgA deposition
* Treatment: often self-limiting over 4 wk; steroids ± DMARDs for renal or severe disease
