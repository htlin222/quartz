# Lumbar Puncture

â€¢Â Â Â Common indications: Concern for CNS infection, autoimmune or inflammatory condition, or malignancy; also can be used to diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial pressure abnormalities, or to reduce CSF pressure therapeutically

â€¢Â Â Â Obtain NCHCT prior to LP if: Patient >60 yr, immunocompromised state, history of CNS disease (e.g., mass lesion, stroke, focal infection), seizure within one week of presentation, focal neurologic deficit

â€¢Â Â Â CSF studies:
-Â Â Â Always send: Cell count with differential, protein, glucose (check serum glucose simultaneously)
-Â Â Â Additional CSF testing to consider based on clinical suspicion:
**â€¢**Â Â Â Autoimmune or inflammatory: Oligoclonal bands, IgG index, targeted autoantibody tests
**â€¢**Â Â Â Infection: Bacterial gram stain and culture, targeted infectious studies (PCR, serology, AFB, fungal, or viral culture)
**â€¢**Â Â Â Malignancy: Cytology and flow cytometry
â€¢Â Â Â Contraindications:
-Â Â Â Local infection over the site of puncture
-Â Â Â Coagulopathy: Platelet goal >50K/Î¼L, INR < 1.7
-Â Â Â If known intracranial or spinal cord mass lesion, always obtain imaging first. Mass lesions are not always a contraindication for LP, but imaging should be reviewed prior to attempted LP
