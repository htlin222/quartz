# Cheyne-Stokes respirations

Cheyne-Stokes breathing involves a period of fast, shallow breathing followed by slow, heavier breathing and moments without any breath at all (apneas).

Chyne-Stokes breathing: on fast breathing, CO2 is decreased and O2 is increased â†’ respiratory depression and after few seconds, it recurs. It is found in all normal subjects but damped by the fluids of blood, and the brain contains dissolved CO2 and O2 to minimize the effect but it can occur in:

1. Severe heart failure, where slow blood circulation to the brain
2. Brain damage â†’ reverse feed-back
