### Alcoholic Hepatitis

â€¢Â Â Â **STOPAH.** *N Engl J Med* 2015;372(17):1619â€“1628.

-Â Â Â Prospective multicenter randomized, double-blind trial in 65 hospitals in the UK comparing the use of prednisone, pentoxifylline, combination prednisone-pentoxifylline, or placebo in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Neither prednisolone nor pentoxifylline reduced all-cause mortality at 28 days. Prednisolone was associated with a nonsignificant mortality benefit at 28 days but no benefit at 90 days or 1 yr.
