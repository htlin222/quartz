- Consider if sx w/ rate control (eg, HF), difficult to control rate, or tachycardia-mediated CMP
- If minimally sx or asx, previously no clear benefit vs. rate control (NEJM 2008;358:2667)
- For recent AF (~1 mo), rhythm-control w/ AAD (flecainide, amio) & cardioversion (if persist. AF) superior to usual care for achieving SR and ↓ adverse CV events (NEJM 2020;383:1305)

> 參考 ➡️ [Early rhythm-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2019422)

    - Early rhythm-control therapy was associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions.
