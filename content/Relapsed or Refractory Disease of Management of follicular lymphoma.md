# Relapsed or Refractory Disease of Management of follicular lymphoma
* Consider transformed disease at progression, pts can be screened w/ PET but confirmation should be w/ bx when possible
* Asx relapsed pts can be observed, as w/ untreated pts
* Choice of 2nd-line Rx influenced by quality & duration of response to initial Rx. Front-line regimen can be re-used if remission duration was long (> expected median duration)
* If rituximab-sensitive (PFS >6 months after last rituximab): Rituximab Â± chemo remains effective in relapsed pts. Rituximab monotherapy ORR is ~45%, but is more commonly combined w/ chemotherapy in relapsed pts
* If rituximab-refractory: Obinutuzumab-Benda â†’ Obinutuzumab maintenance improves PFS & OS c/w bendamustine monotherapy (GADOLIN Study, Lancet Oncol 2016)
* Idelalisib monotherapy or lenalidomide plus rituximab alternative options in relapsed/refractory FL, w/ idelalisib approved after 2 prior Rx
* Radioimmunotherapy
* Very low-dose RT (400 cGy) provides excellent local control & palliation in 70% of R/R pts
* Pts w/a short remission duration who fail to achieve EFS12 or PFS24 should be considered for consolidation w/ high dose therapy and autologous stem cell rescue or allogeneic stem cell transplant after the 2nd-line Rx
* Choice of autologous or allogeneic transplant is made individually; usually based on such factors as pt age & comorbidity, availability of a suitable donor, & the biology & behavior of the lymphoma
