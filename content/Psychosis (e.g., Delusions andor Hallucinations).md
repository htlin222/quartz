### Psychosis (e.g., Delusions and/or Hallucinations)

â€¢Â Â Â Definitions:

-Â Â Â **Delusions:** False, fixed beliefs that persist in the face of challenging/contrary evidence and which are not typical of a patientâ€™s culture or religion; subtypes include erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, somatic, mixed, and unspecified

-Â Â Â **Hallucinations:** Perceptions of sensory experiences in the absence of external stimuli

â€¢Â Â Â Differential diagnosis:

-Â Â Â Primary psychotic disorder

-Â Â Â Substance use disorder

-Â Â Â Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms

-Â Â Â Delirium

-Â Â Â Dementia (especially Lewy body dementia)

-Â Â Â Psychosis due to another medical condition

**â€¢**Â Â Â Endocrine (hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Metabolic (hepatic encephalopathy, uremic encephalopathy, vitamin B12 deficiency, Wilsonâ€™s disease, acute intermittent porphyria)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Infectious (HIV, neurosyphilis, herpes simplex encephalitis, Lymeâ€™s disease)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Inflammatory or demyelinating disorders (anti-NDMA encephalitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Neurodegenerative disease (particularly Lewy body dementia; also Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Huntingtonâ€™s disease)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Other neurological disorders (epilepsy, intracranial tumor, prion disease)

â€¢Â Â Â Approach by hallucination subtype:

-Â Â Â **Auditory:** More commonly a feature of primary psychiatric illness, but other causes also occur

-Â Â Â **Visual:** More commonly a feature of substance use or medical illness, but other causes also occur, including primary psychiatric disease

-Â Â Â **Tactile:** Most common in setting of substance use (e.g., alcohol withdrawal; stimulant intoxication), although delusional parasitosis (the belief that one is infested with a pathogen) is on the differential diagnosis as well

-Â Â Â **Olfactory:** Most commonly an aura of temporal lobe epilepsy or in the setting of an intracranial mass

-Â Â Â **Gustatory:** Very rare; occurs occasionally in epilepsy

-Â Â Â **Hypnagogic:** Occurs while going to sleep; not typically pathologic

-Â Â Â **Hypnopompic:** Occurs while waking from sleep; not typically pathologic

â€¢Â Â Â Work-up: Basic labs, UA, urinary toxicology; consider other testing, such as head imaging, based on clinical features and context

â€¢Â Â Â Management:

-Â Â Â Acute therapy

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treat underlying cause if identified

**â€¢**Â Â Â If risk of harm, consider rapid sedation with benzodiazepine, antipsychotics (PO or IM)

-Â Â Â Maintenance therapy for primary psychotic disorder: See Table 13.4
