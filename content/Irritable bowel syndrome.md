## Explain by ChatGPT

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder that affects the large intestine. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits.

IBS is divided into four subtypes: IBS-C (constipation predominant), IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-M (mixed), and IBS-U (unclassified). Symptoms may be affected by stress, diet, lifestyle, and the microbiome.

Treatment of IBS includes cognitive behavioral therapy, probiotics, anti-spasmodics, exercise, and neuromodulators such as tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Dietary changes include a low FODMAP diet and a lactose-free diet.

IBS-C is treated with fiber, laxatives, and biofeedback. IBS-D is treated with loperamide, rifaximin, eluxadoline, bile acid sequestrants, and alosetron. IBS-M is treated with loperamide and rifaximin.

腸易激綜合徵 (IBS) 是一種影響大腸的慢性疾病。症狀包括腹痛、腹脹和排便習慣改變。

IBS 分為四種亞型：IBS-C（便秘為主）、IBS-D（腹瀉為主）、IBS-M（混合）和 IBS-U（未分類）。症狀可能會受到壓力、飲食、生活方式和微生物組的影響。

IBS 的治療包括認知行為療法、益生菌、抗痙攣藥、運動和神經調節劑，例如三環類抗抑鬱藥和選擇性血清素再攝取抑製劑。飲食變化包括低 FODMAP 飲食和無乳糖飲食。

IBS-C 用纖維、瀉藥和生物反饋治療。 IBS-D 用洛哌丁胺、利福昔明、eluxadoline、膽汁酸多價螯合劑和阿洛司瓊治療。 IBS-M 用洛哌丁胺和利福昔明治療。
