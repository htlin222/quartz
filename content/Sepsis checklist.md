# Sepsis checklist

- Use a sepsis screening tool (e.g., SIRS criteria) in at-risk patients.
- Obtain IV access and blood samples including 2 sets of blood cultures and serum lactate.
- Begin continuous cardiac and respiratory monitoring.
- Consider invasive BP monitoring and central venous line insertion if septic shock is present.
- Initiate fluid resuscitation with 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid.
- Add vasopressors if shock persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation.
- Provide respiratory support as needed.
- Start empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (within 1 hour for septic shock or high PTP of sepsis).
- Conduct frequent reassessments, e.g., hemodynamic parameters, serial serum lactate, fluid balance monitoring
- Complete evaluation for organ dysfunction, e.g., CBC, BMP, liver chemistries, blood gas, coagulation panel
- Consider additional imaging and cultures (urine, wound, sputum) based on clinical suspicion.
- Arrange source control for sepsis, e.g., remove infected intravascular catheters, consult surgery for acute abdomen
- Start supportive care, e.g., maintenance of normoglycemia, nutritional support, VTE prophylaxis
- Identify and treat complications, e.g., DIC, ARDS, AKI
