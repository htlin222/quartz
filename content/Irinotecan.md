# Irinotecan

- [[Topoisomerase I inhibitors]]
  - Inhibition of topoisomerase I â†’ â†“ DNA unwinding â†’ â†“ DNA replication and DNA degradation (because of ssDNA breaks)

- Dosing:
  - 180mg/BSA in mCRC
  - 125 mg/m2 Ã— 4 wks w/ 2 wks rest. Homozygous for UGT1A1*28 allele & hepatic impairment (Tbili > ULN): â†“ dose, no specific adjustments suggested
- PK/PD: Extensive extravascular distribution, active drug (SN-38) hepatically glucuronidated via UGT1A1, renal excretion (25%), remainder eliminated via hepatic metabolism & biliary excretion, T1/2 6-12 h (irinotecan), 10-20 h (SN-38)

- detail: [[Adverse Reactions of Irinotecan|Adverse Reactions]] ó°’–
  - Diarrhea (DLT, early & delayed),
      - [[Cholinergic syndrome]]
  - Pulmonary toxicity (irinotecan)
  - myelosuppression (`neutropenia`),
  - abdominal pain,
  - N/V (mod. emetogenic potential),
  - alopecia,
  - fatigue,
  - â†‘ LFTs & Tbili,
  - pulmonary tox (uncommon)
- DDI: [[CYP3A4]] inducers/inhibitors (â†“/â†‘ conc. of irinotecan)
- Clinical pearls:
  - Diarrhea <24 h: Acute cholinergic effect produced by inhibition of [[acetylcholinesterase]] by prodrug, treat w/ atropine.
  - Diarrhea >24 h: Mucosal cytotoxicity, treat w/ loperamide &/or octreotide.
