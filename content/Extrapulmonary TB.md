# Extrapulmonary TB

- lymphadenitis,
- pericarditis,
- peritonitis,
- CNS disease including meningitis,
- GU tract disease
- ± sterile pyuria,
- osteoarticular disease (vertebral = [[Pott’s disease]]),
- granulomatous hepatitis, splenitis, cutaneous disease

## Workup

- Pleural/pericardial effusions or ascites:
  - fluid sampling for AFB cx/smear, NAAT/ PCR, cell counts.
  - Adenosine deaminase (ADA) can be ↑, best validated in ascites.
  - Free INFγ can be elevated in pleural/ascitic fluid (not validated in pericardial effusions).
  - Higher diagnostic yield with pleural/pericardial biopsies for disease at these sites.
- CSF:
  - fluid sampling for AFB cx/smear (submit at least 10 mL),
  - NAAT/PCR,
  - cell count ( NB: lymphocyte predominanace),
  - glucose (low),
  - protein (high),
  - ADA (high)
- Soft tissue:
  - tissue biopsy with AFB staining,
  - pathology w/ granulomas
