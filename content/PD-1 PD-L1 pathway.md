* PD-1/PD-L1 pathway controls the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance within the tumor microenvironment. The activity of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 are responsible for T cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic secretion in cancer to degenerating anti-tumor immune responses

* PD-L1 acts as a pro-tumorigenic factor in cancer cells via binding to its receptors and activating proliferative and survival signaling pathways
