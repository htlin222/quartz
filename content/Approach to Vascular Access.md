### Approach to Vascular Access


**TABLE 3.1 â€¢ Flow Relationship Defined by the Poiseuille Equation**




â€¢Â Â Â Determinants of flow rate:

-Â Â Â Catheter radius (larger radius â†’ larger area â†’ higher flows)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Small changes in radius have relatively large impacts on flow rates

**â€¢**Â Â Â Measured as French (Fr) vs. gauge

-Â Â Â Two scales that reflect the diameter and therefore size of the lumen

â€¢Â Â Â Fr: Larger Fr catheters (i.e., higher number) have LARGER diameters

â€¢Â Â Â Gauge: Larger gauge catheters (i.e., higher numbers) have SMALLER diameters

-Â Â Â Length of catheter (shorter catheter â†’ higher flows)

-Â Â Â Number of lumens (fewer lumens â†’ higher flows)

-Â Â Â Pressure difference (larger changes in pressure â†’ higher flows rates)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Augment by using pressure bags, manually squeezing the bag, or increasing vertical distance between the fluid bag and the patient

-Â Â Â Viscosity: More viscous products (i.e., blood) will flow more slowly

â€¢Â Â Â Venous site selection:

-Â Â Â Internal jugular (most common)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pros: High placement success rate, low risk of pneumothorax with ultrasound guidance

**â€¢**Â Â Â Cons: Possible higher rate of bloodstream infections compared to subclavian

-Â Â Â Subclavian

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pros: Likely lowest rates of bloodstream infections of the three sites

**â€¢**Â Â Â Cons: Highest rate of pneumothorax, decreased placement success rate with less experienced providers

-Â Â Â Femoral

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pros: High placement success rate, no pneumothorax risk. Often used in trauma or codes given site is away from intubation or CPR

**â€¢**Â Â Â Cons: Possible higher rate of bloodstream infections given location, limits patient mobility

â€¢Â Â Â Vascular access options for common patient scenarios:

-Â Â Â Most patients in the ICU and medical wards:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Angiocath for peripheral venous access: Various sizes, including 14G, 16G, 18G, 20G, 22G

-Â Â Â ICU patient with septic shock requiring vasopressors, multiple IV antibiotics, and other medications:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Triple-lumen central venous catheter: Contains three lumens which are 1 Ã— 16G and 2 Ã— 18G; catheter length from 15â€“30 cm selected based on patient size and insertion location

-Â Â Â Gastrointestinal bleed requiring aggressive and rapid transfusion of multiple blood products:

**â€¢**Â Â Â MULTIPLE large-bore (often 16G or 18G) peripheral IVs

**â€¢**Â Â Â Alternative is an introducer or cordis, which are short catheters with large diameters, most commonly 8 Fr

-Â Â Â Code blue â†’ PEA arrest in a patient without IV access:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Intraosseous (IO) access into a long bone (often tibia) with a 15G tibial needle enabling rapid infusions; short-term use until other access can be obtained

-Â Â Â Patient with endocarditis or osteomyelitis requiring long-term administration of antibiotics:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC): Long catheters ranging from 30â€“60 cm in length; single-, double-, or triple-lumen options, with lumens being 4â€“5 Fr or 18G
