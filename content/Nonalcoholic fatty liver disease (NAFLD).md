# Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

- **General Measures:** Apply to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.
- **Vaccinations:** Hepatitis A and B vaccination for non-immune patients.
- **Immunizations:** Standard age-appropriate immunizations.
- **Hyperlipidemia:** Lipid-lowering therapy for patients with hyperlipidemia.
- **Diabetes:** Optimize blood glucose control for diabetic patients.

- **Weight Management:** Recommend weight loss for obesity, 5-7% body weight via lifestyle changes.
- **Alcohol Avoidance:** Refrain from heavy alcohol use, suggest abstinence.
- **Medical Therapy:**

  - **NASH without Diabetes:** Suggest vitamin E (800 IU/day) for NASH patients without diabetes.
  - **NASH with Diabetes:** Choose glucose-lowering therapy based on NASH presence.
  - **Options:** Consider
    - pioglitazone,
    - GLP-1 receptor agonists.

- **Lab Monitoring:** Check aminotransferases post-weight loss, evaluate abnormal levels.
- **Fibrosis Monitoring:** Noninvasive fibrosis assessment based on weight loss and aminotransferase levels.
  - **Assessment Interval:** 3 years if weight loss not achieved, 4 years if weight loss achieved.

- Definition: fatty infiltration of liver + absence of EtOH or other cause of steatosis (HCV, etc.)
  NAFL = steatosis, Ø inflam; NASH = steatosis + inflam ± fibrosis on bx

- NAFLD: 25% of U.S. pop. & over 60% in T2DM & obesity
- NASH: 2–5% of NAFLD & risk of cirrhosis in NASH w/ fibrosis on bx is 30% at 10 y
- Clinical: 80% asx, ↑ ALT > AST, but nl ALT/AST does not exclude poss. of NASH on bx
- Dx: liver bx remains gold standard. VCT elastography emerging alternative (J Hepatol 2017;66:1022). FIB-4/NAFLD fibrosis score predicts NASH w/ advanced fibrosis w/ PPV >80%.
