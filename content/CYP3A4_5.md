# CYP3A4_5

- CYP3A isoenzymes account for âˆ¼50% of the metabolic activity of all CYP450 enzymes
- Substrates include etoposide, paclitaxel, & vincristine
- SNP frequencies of CYP3A4 relatively low in most populations (14% in Caucasians & 10% in Japanese individuals) making it difficult to link genotype to PK or PD of CYP3A4 substrates
- Study conducted by the National Childrenâ€™s CA Group Pediatric ALL trial set out to correlate the association between relapse & tox of 1,204 pts w/ CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3, & CYP3A5\*6 SNPs. Trial results were neg; however, 1st 2 variants had a statistically significant â†‘ risk of peripheral neuropathy
