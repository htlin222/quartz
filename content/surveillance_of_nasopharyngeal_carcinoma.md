# surveillance_of_nasopharyngeal_carcinoma

Recommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see Follow-up Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Since the deep areas of the skull base are inaccessible to clinical examination, periodic cross-sectional imaging may be necessary. Likewise, inspection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa may be best accomplished with periodic endoscopy.

The clinical benefit of plasma EBV DNA monitoring is not yet clearly defined (see Epstein-Barr Virus, above), but it may be considered in centers with experience (category 2B).
