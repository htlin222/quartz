### Precision vs. Accuracy

â€¢Â Â Â Precision/reliability: Does a test generate similar results on repeat measurements? Tests that have less random error are more precise/reliable. However, a test can yield consistent results (i.e., be highly precise), but generate results that are inaccurate

â€¢Â Â Â Accuracy/validity: Does a test generate a result that is true or right (imagine: hitting a bullseye)?
