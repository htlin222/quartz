# CORRECT

- [Regorafenib monotherapy for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (CORRECT): an international, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial - PubMed](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/23177514/)
- Patients were randomised to receive oral regorafenib 160 mg or matching placebo once daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxic effects, withdrawal of consent by the patient, or decision by the treating physician that discontinuation would be in the patient's best interest.
- Median overall survival was 6.4 months in the regorafenib group versus 5.0 months in the placebo group
