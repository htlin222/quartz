# Prognosis-Alcohol-associated hepatitis

scoring systems include Maddrey’s discriminant fxn (MDF), Lille model, MELD

MDF (4.6 × [PT – control] + Tb) ≥32 w/ 30–50% 1-mo mortality if unRx’d (Gastro 1996;110:1847)

Lille model: predicts nonresponse to steroids after 1st week of Rx; score >0.45 predicts poor response to further steroid Rx and a/w ↓ in 6-mo survival (Hep 2007;45:1348)

Combination of Lille + MELD scores best predictor of mortality (Gastro 2015;149:398)
