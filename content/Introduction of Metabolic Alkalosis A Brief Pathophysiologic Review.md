# Introduction of Metabolic Alkalosis A Brief Pathophysiologic Review

Metabolic alkalosis is a primary acid-base disorder that increases the serum bicarbonate concentration [HCO3âˆ’] (this is usually approximated by its surrogate the venous total [CO2]) above 30 meq/L (1), causing the arterial blood [H+] to fall, *i.e.*, the arterial blood pH increases into the alkaline range (>7.45). Metabolic alkalosis is a very common disorder, especially in ICU settings (2). The diagnostic criteria and a pathophysiologic approach to differential diagnosis and treatment on the basis of dissection of the etiology and dominant maintenance mechanisms are reviewed.
