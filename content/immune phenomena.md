## Explain by ChatGPT


The immune system is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from infection. The immune system can be divided into two main parts: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.

The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense against infection. It is made up of a variety of cells and proteins that work together to Recognize, Respond, and Destroy invading pathogens.

The adaptive immune system is the body's second line of defense against infection. It is made up of a variety of cells and proteins that work together to Recognize, Respond, and Destroy invading pathogens.

免疫系統是由細胞、組織和器官組成的網絡，它們協同工作以保護身體免受感染。免疫系統可分為兩個主要部分：先天免疫系統和適應性免疫系統。

先天免疫系統是人體抵禦感染的第一道防線。它由多種細胞和蛋白質組成，它們協同工作以識別、響應和消滅入侵的病原體。

適應性免疫系統是人體抵禦感染的第二道防線。它由多種細胞和蛋白質組成，它們協同工作以識別、響應和消滅入侵的病原體。
