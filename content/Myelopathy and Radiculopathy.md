### Myelopathy and Radiculopathy

•   Description: Neurologic deficit related to the spinal cord

•   Physical exam:

-   Myelopathy: Pyramidal weakness in the arms/legs, bowel or bladder dysfunction, numbness including saddle anesthesia, hyperreflexia below the level of the lesion (may be hyporeflexive at the level of the lesion or if hyperacute), spasticity, \+Babinski sign

-   Radiculopathy: Sensory and motor symptoms referable to an individual nerve root

•   Key clinical syndromes:

-   Conus medullaris syndrome: Diseases affecting spinal cord levels S2–S5 resulting in back pain, bowel/bladder dysfunction, bilateral sensory loss, and spastic or flaccid weakness.

-   Cauda equina syndrome: Diseases affecting the lumbosacral nerve roots resulting in leg weakness, saddle anesthesia, urinary retention/incontinence, fecal incontinence, impotence, reduced patellar and ankle reflexes

•   Etiologies:

-   Compressive: Spondylotic (degenerative/arthritic), tumor, infection (abscess), trauma/hemorrhage

-   Non-compressive:

**•**   Non-inflammatory (CSF with normal WBC, normal IgG index, no oligoclonal bands)

-   Vascular: Cord ischemia (e.g., during aortic surgery), dural arteriovenous fistula (slowly progressive myelopathy, common in older men), arteriovenous malformation (often presents with subarachnoid hemorrhage, common in patients 20–30 yr)

-   Infectious: HIV vacuolar myelopathy

-   Toxic/metabolic: B12 deficiency (can be due to pernicious anemia, gastrectomy, Crohn’s, malnutrition, medication effect), nitrous oxide toxicity (functional B12 deficiency), vitamin E deficiency, copper deficiency (can be due to zinc excess \[denture cream\!\])

-   Inherited: Friedreich ataxia, adrenoleukodystrophy

-   Structural: Syringomyelia (post-traumatic or associated with Chiari malformation; areflexia at level of lesion, “cape-like” distribution of sensory loss to pain and temperature)

**•**   Inflammatory (CSF with abnormal WBC or abnormal IgG index/oligoclonal bands)

-   Autoimmune: Multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica (NMO), SLE, Sjogren’s, sarcoid, ADEM

-   Infectious: HSV, CMV, VZV, HIV, HTLV-1, enterovirus, fungal infections, tuberculosis, Lyme, syphilis (tabes dorsalis, affects dorsal columns)

-   Neoplastic: Lymphoma, paraneoplastic, solid tumor malignancies (may also have bland CSF)
