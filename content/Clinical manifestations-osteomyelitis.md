## Explain by ChatGPT


* There may be damage to the tissues around the bone, or an infection in the bone may cause a fistula (an abnormal connection) to form between the bone and the skin.
* Fever, feeling tired and sweaty, and general discomfort are more common when the infection is spread through the bloodstream (hematogenous) than when it is spread to the bone from nearby tissue (contiguous).
* Vertebral osteomyelitis is a type of osteomyelitis that is especially common in people who **inject drugs intravenously (IVDU)**. It causes unremitting (constant) back pain, and sometimes fever.

## 窩的英文不太好

* 骨骼周圍的組織可能受損，或者骨骼感染可能導致骨骼和皮膚之間形成瘻管（異常連接）。
* 當感染通過血流傳播（血源性）時，發燒、感覺疲倦和出汗以及全身不適比從附近組織（連續）傳播到骨骼時更常見。
* 脊椎骨髓炎是一種骨髓炎，在靜脈注射藥物 (IVDU) 的人群中尤為常見。它會導致持續（持續）背痛，有時還會發燒。
