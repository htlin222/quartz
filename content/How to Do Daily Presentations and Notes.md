### How to Do Daily Presentations and Notes

•   Format: Typically, daily presentations about each patient are presented in a “**SOAP**” note format.

-   Typically mention 24-hour events first

-   **S**: **S**ubjective – What are the patient’s symptoms today?

-   **O**: **O**bjective – Vitals, physical exam, ins/outs (if relevant), labs, new micro & imaging

-   **A/P**: **A**ssessment and **P**lan – Ensure that the patient one-liner is up to date\! Then present by problem, e.g., problem 1: Sepsis, likely from a pulmonary source; problem 2: Diabetes
