### Renal Cystic Diseases

##### Renal cysts

â€¢Â Â Â Classification: Categorized as simple or complex based on imaging appearance

-Â Â Â Simple cysts (thin walled, fluid filled, no enhancement) are very common with advancing age. Typically benign, but may need intervention if size or location causes pain or impaired renal function.

-Â Â Â Complex cysts (enhancement, solid components) have a high risk of malignancy; may require partial or total nephrectomy for tissue examination

##### Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Mutation in PKD1 or PKD2 (chromosome 16), most common hereditary kidney disease in the United States

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features:

-Â Â Â Onset of hypertension, hematuria, nephrolithiasis in young adulthood (PKD1) or in middle age (PKD2)

-Â Â Â Increased risk for extrarenal diagnoses: Circle of Willis berry aneurysm (risk factor for subarachnoid hemorrhage), hepatic cysts, diverticula, abdominal hernias, and consequences of HTN (e.g., CVD)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Combination of family history, genetic testing, and ultrasound showing bilateral kidneys with cysts

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: No curative treatment. Control hypertension, manage pain (from cyst rupture or pressure). The majority of patients will require dialysis or a kidney transplant.
