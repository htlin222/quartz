# anion gap

- (AG) = Na+ – (Cl– + HCO3–) = unmeasured anions – unmeasured cations
  If ↑ glc, use measured not corrected Na

Expected AG is **[albumin] × 2.5** (ie, **10 if albumin is 4 g/dL**, 7.5 if albumin is 3 g/dL)
↑ AG → ↑ unmeasured anions such as [[organic acids, phosphates, sulfates]]
↓ AG → ↓ alb or ↑ unmeasured _cations_ (Ca, Mg, K, Li, Ig), bromide/iodine toxicity

- If ↑ AG, ✓ [[delta-delta]]
