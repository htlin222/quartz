# Diagnostic studies-aortic aneurysms


(JACC 2020;76:201)
* Contrast CT: quick, noninvasive, high Se & Sp for all aortic aneurysms
* TTE/TEE: TTE most useful for root and proximal Ao; TEE can visualize other sites of TAA
* MRI: favored over CT for AoRoot imaging; useful in AAA but time consuming; noncontrast “black blood” MR to assess aortic wall
* Abdominal U/S: screening/surveillance test of choice for infrarenal AAA
