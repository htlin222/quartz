### Right Heart Catheterization

â€¢Â Â Â Procedure: Insertation of a catheter into the right heart and pulmonary arteries usually via the IJ or brachial vein in order to measure the RA, RV, PA, and wedge pressures as well as cardiac output.

â€¢Â Â Â Indications: Diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, assessment of hemodynamics in heart failure (specifically: pre-heart transplant, if unable to wean from inotropes, severe symptoms of hypotension despite medical therapy).
