# Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer patients

- Operable breast cancer preferred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy includes:
  - [[Triple negative]] breast cancer `or`  HER2 positive cancer
    - with clinical T-stage â‰§ cT2 or N-stage â‰§ cN1
  - For locally advanced breast cancer patients
    - (â‰§ cT3 or cN2)
  - Larger primary tumor relative to breast size
    - in patients who desire breast conservation therapy

- Clips placement both at â†£ primary tumor and positive axillary lymph node(s) is â†’ suggested for tumor localization before neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  - BCS/Mastectomy
  - Axillary management:
    - If cN0 both before and after C/T â†’ SLNB
    - If cN1 become ycN0 after C/T, may consider SLNB + clipped node removal
    - If cN2 or cN3 before C/T â†’ ALND
