# molecular analysis of follicular lymphoma

- evaluate for chromosomal abnormalities using karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization ([[FISH]]); look for
  - BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangements
  - translocation ðŸ‘‰ [[t(14:18)]]
  - 1p36 deletion (follicular lymphoma with 1p36 deletion associated with inguinal node involvement, typically grade 1-2 with good prognosis)
  - IRF4/MUM1 rearrangement
  - IRF4 translocations often seen with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma but possible for both diagnosis to be present
  - if purely follicular lymphoma, often presents as grade 3b
- evaluate for immunoglobulin gene rearrangements (possible predictive marker of histological disease transformation)
- look for EZH2, TNFRSF14, and STAT6 mutations, for targeted therapy options and further diagnostic information, by next generation sequencing (NGS)
