### Non-Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphoma (NHL)

â€¢Â Â Â Risk factors: HIV, immunosuppression, EBV/HTLV-1 infection, *H. pylori* (MALT lymphoma), autoimmune conditions

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Bulky lymphadenopathy (painless, firm, mobile), hepatosplenomegaly; B symptoms less common than with Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, hepatosplenomegaly

â€¢Â Â Â NHL Subtypes:

-Â Â Â See Table 7.3 â€“ generally divided into indolent and aggressive subtypes

**â€¢**Â Â Â Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent NHL (see details below)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive NHL (see details below)

##### Follicular lymphoma (FL)

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Most common indolent NHL

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Typically, indolent course. However, it is incurable and can relapse despite prolonged remission. Life expectancy 12â€“15 yr from time of diagnosis.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â For asymptomatic FL: Typically, observe if low tumor burden, particularly in elderly patients. Watchful waiting vs. up-front treatment with rituximab does not affect overall survival. However, in some patients initial treatment with rituximab may improve quality of life and postpone cytotoxic chemotherapy.

-Â Â Â For symptomatic FL: Consider treatment with anti-CD20 therapy (rituximab) if more lymph node involvement, splenomegaly, pleural effusions, systemic symptoms, large tumor causing organ dysfunction, etc. If severe disease, can consider cytotoxic chemotherapy with R-CHOP.

-Â Â Â Relapsed disease: Restage, many treatment approaches

â€¢Â Â Â Transformation: It is possible for FL to transform to a more aggressive lymphoma

-Â Â Â All low-grade lymphomas can transform, but most literature focuses on FL. Risk of transformation to aggressive lymphoma (typically DLBCL) is 1â€“2% per year, with a lifetime risk of 30%.

##### Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Most common aggressive NHL

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Lymphadenopathy; up to 40% present with disease in extranodal locations, most commonly in the GI tract, but also can involve the CNS, lungs, GU tract, and reproductive tract

â€¢Â Â Â Morphology: Diffuse effacement of the normal lymph node architecture by intermediate to large-sized cells. Significant genetic heterogeneity.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: R-CHOP or R-EPOCH chemotherapy

-Â Â Â R-CHOP: Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine (Oncovin), prednisone

-Â Â Â R-EPOCH: Rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine (Oncovin), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride

-Â Â Â CNS prophylaxis is needed for patients with DLBCL who have high-risk features and for all patients with Burkittâ€™s, lymphoblastic lymphoma, or HIV-associated aggressive lymphomas
