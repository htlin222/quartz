# variant_discovery

- somatic variant calling is used to study diseases like cancer
- In somatic variant calling, the reference is a related tissue from the same individual (e.g., healthy tissue in the case of cancer).
- Here, we expect to see genetic mosaicism between cells or presence of more than one genetic line as a result of genetic mutations.
-

There are several types of genetic variation studies but generally they can be classified into

- (i) Genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
- (ii) studies on consequences of variants
  - Clinical functional consequences are represented by a simple controlled vocabulary that defines the relative pathogenicity of a variant,
    - such as benign,
    - likely benign,
    - uncertain significance,
    - likely pathogenic, or
    - pathogenic.
- (iii) Population genetics


[[allele_frequencies.md|Allele frequencies]] are also influenced by the random genetic drift. This process explains the fluc- tuation in allele frequencies from one generation to another.
