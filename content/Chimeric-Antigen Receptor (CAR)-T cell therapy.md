### Chimeric-Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy

â€¢Â Â Â Mechanism: T cells are collected from the patient and genetically modified with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to direct the T-cells against the tumor cells.

â€¢Â Â Â Indications:

-Â Â Â B-cell ALL, NHL: CAR directed against CD19

-Â Â Â Multiple myeloma: CAR directed against BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen; a cell surface TNF receptor)

â€¢Â Â Â Toxicities:

-Â Â Â Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Systemic inflammatory response due to cytokine release after CAR-T therapy

**â€¢**Â Â Â Clinical features: Fever, fatigue, headache, rash, myalgias, diarrhea. Can have very high fevers (104ËšF) and can progress to SIRS with hypotension and multi-organ failure. Confusion, lethargy, and even seizures/cerebral edema can occur 2â€“5 days after onset of CRS and can be progressive. CRS occurs in approximately 25â€“50% of patients who receive CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL; less common for patients who receive CAR-T cell therapy for multiple myeloma.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Diagnosis: â†‘CRP and ferritin, dramatic elevation of IL-6. Degree of IL-6 elevation is associated with severity of CRS. See American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy guidelines for grading severity.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treatment: Supportive care to manage SIRS. For severe CRS, consider steroids and/or tocilizumab (monoclonal antibody against IL-6) in consultation with the heme/onc team.

-Â Â Â Neurotoxicity:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Not well understood, also thought to be related to cytokine release after CAR-T therapy. Also called ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome) or CRES (cytokine release encephalopathy syndrome).

**â€¢**Â Â Â Clinical features: Wide range of symptoms including headache, tremor, expressive aphasia, impaired attention, seizures, cerebral edema. Usually occurs 4â€“5 days after CAR-T infusion. Can occur independently of CRS.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Treatment: Steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Should discuss with heme/onc team.
