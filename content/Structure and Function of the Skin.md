### Structure and Function of the Skin

â€¢Â Â Â Function of skin: The skin is a large, complex organ with a variety of important functions: Mechanical barrier, temperature regulation, fluid balance, immune response

â€¢Â Â Â Layers of the skin: The skin has three layers: 1) Epidermis, 2) Dermis, and 3) Hypodermis (adipose tissue, sweat glands, blood vessels, lymphatics)

â€¢Â Â Â Layers of the epidermis: From surface to base â€“ stratum corneum (keratin), stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum (desmosomes), and stratum basale
