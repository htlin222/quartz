# Oncology - Malignant Bowel Obstruction - Fast Facts | NEJM Resident 360
Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO)**,** especially of abdominal or gynecological origin, is common in patients with advanced cancer. MBO is defined as:

*   clinical evidence of bowel obstruction
    
*   obstruction distal to the Treitz ligament
    
*   the presence of primary intra-abdominal or extra-abdominal cancer with peritoneal involvement
    
*   the absence of reasonable possibilities for a cure.  
      
    

### Symptoms

### Diagnostic Workup

*   Plain abdominal radiograph is sensitive for high-grade obstruction and is quick and easily accessible.
    
*   Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT can detect low-grade obstructions as well as quantitate disease burden and other clinical factors (e.g., bowel ischemia).
    
*   Routine bloodwork can rule out metabolic derangement (electrolytes, extended electrolytes); include CBC, lactate, and renal function.  
      
    

### Management

*   palliative surgery (e.g., intestinal bypass, lysis of adhesions, removal of tumor); often not feasible, especially if patient is malnourished, has peritoneal disease, or has multiple levels of obstruction
    
*   endoscopic or interventional radiology procedures (e.g., stenting or placement of venting gastrostomy tubes)
    
*   medical management: When the above interventions are not feasible, medical management can include the following:
    
    *   bowel rest
        
    *   nasogastric decompression (NGT)
        
    *   total parenteral nutrition (TPN) — controversial and should be reserved for patients with a preserved general status, slow-growing tumors, the possibility of response to chemotherapy, and reasonable expectations of survival
        
    *   adequate symptom management with analgesia and antiemetics (e.g., haldol); avoid prokinetic agents in cases of complete obstruction
        
        *   opiates — do not avoid but note capacity to affect bowel motility
            
        *   glucocorticoids — have antiemetic properties; may increase rate of spontaneous resolution of MBOs by reducing inflammation
            
        *   antisecretory drugs (e.g., scopolamine, hyoscine butylbromide, and octreotide) to reduce intestinal hypersecretion; octreotide has been shown to have the greatest efficacy in controlled trials
            
        *   decompressive percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in some patients for symptom management and palliation
