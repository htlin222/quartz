# Intrinsic acute kidney injury etiology

## [[Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)]]
* Pigmented granular [[muddy brown casts]]
* ± RBCs & protein from tubular damage
* FENa >2%, BUN/Cr <20 (except pigment, CIN)
* FEUN >50%

## [[Acute interstitial nephritis]]
* WBCs, WBC casts, ± RBCs w/ neg UCx
* ⊕ urine eos in abx
* ⊕ lymphs in NSAIDs

## [[Small-med vessel acute kidney injury]]
* ± RBCs
* ⊕ urine eos in chol emboli

## [[glomerulonephritis]]
* [[dysmorphic red blood cell]], RBC casts

## Explain by ChatGPT

* WBC casts
* ± proteinuria
* ± hematuria

- ATN is characterized by pigmented granular muddy brown casts, ± RBCs & protein from tubular damage, and FENa * FEUN
- Acute interstitial nephritis is characterized by WBCs, WBC casts, ± RBCs w/ neg UCx, ⊕ urine eos in abx, ⊕ lymphs in NSAIDs
- Small-med vessel acute kidney injury is characterized by ± RBCs, ⊕ urine eos in chol emboli
- Glomerulonephritis is characterized by Dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, WBC casts, ± proteinuria, ± hematuria

## 窩的英文不太好

- ATN 的特徵是有色素的顆粒狀渾濁棕色管型、± 紅細胞和來自管狀損傷的蛋白質，以及 FENa * FEUN
- 急性間質性腎炎的特徵是 WBC、WBC 管型、± RBC w/ neg UCx、⊕ abx 中的尿液 eos、⊕ 非甾體抗炎藥中的淋巴
- 小血管急性腎損傷的特徵是 ± 紅細胞，⊕ 膽栓塞中的尿液 eos
- 腎小球腎炎的特徵是紅細胞變形、紅細胞管型、白細胞管型、±蛋白尿、±血尿
