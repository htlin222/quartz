### Additional Details about the Platelet Destructive Processes

**Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)**

•   Pathophysiology: Anti-platelet antibodies → Splenic macrophages consume platelet/Ab complex

•   Clinical features*:* Petechiae, purpura, bleeding; NO splenomegaly

•   Diagnosis:

-   Isolated thrombocytopenia (platelets <20K/μl but rest of counts normal)

-   Smear typically has large platelets and NO schistocytes\! Megakaryocytes are present in the bone marrow.

-   Diagnosis of exclusion: No antibody test. Must rule out other causes first (medication-induced, HIV, HCV, *H. pylori*, etc.). Do not usually have to do a bone marrow biopsy in younger patients, but must consider in older patients.

•   Treatment*:*

-   1st line: Dexamethasone (40 mg x 4 days) vs. prednisone 1mg/kg/day with slow taper. IVIG 1g/kg ×2 doses may be used with steroids if a rapid platelet count rise is needed.

-   2nd line: Rituximab, TPO agonists (romiplostim); consider splenectomy if refractory

##### Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)

•   Pathophysiology*:* Endothelial damage caused by medications or Shiga toxin–mediated bloody diarrhea (*Ecoli* O157:H7, Shigella)

•   Clinical features*:*

-   Three classic features: 1) Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA); 2) Thrombocytopenia; 3) Renal failure

-   HUS is clinically similar to TTP, but more likely to have renal failure and less likely to have neurologic symptoms

•   Diagnosis*:* Smear with schistocytes. Positive Shiga-toxin/EHEC test confirms STEC-HUS. Complement gene mutation panel evaluates for atypical (complement-mediated) HUS.

•   Treatment*:* Supportive care; consider plasma exchange (“plex”) and eculizumab for atypical HUS

##### Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

•   Pathophysiology*:* Deficiency in the protease ADAMTS-13 (congenital defect or acquired autoantibody), which usually cleaves vWF. The uncleaved vWF clump and bind to platelets, leading to microvascular occlusion and thrombocytopenia.

•   Clinical features*:* Same as HUS \+ fever \+ neurologic symptoms (seizures, altered mental status). Patients with TTP are less likely to have renal dysfunction than those with HUS.

•   Diagnosis*:* Blood smear with schistocytes. Then this is a clinical diagnosis – start treatment right away\! PLASMIC score can be helpful, but neither sensitive nor specific. Order ADAMTS-13 but don’t wait for the result to initiate treatment.

•   Treatment*:* Immediate plasmapheresis (“plex”)\! TTP is 90% fatal without therapy. Do NOT give platelets – can precipitate further hemolysis\!

##### Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)

**Type 1** (non-immune mediated)

•   Clinical features**:** Drop in platelets that occurs 1–4 days post-heparin, platelets decreased but still >100K/μl

•   Treatment**:** Can continue heparin; does not change clinical management

**Type 2** (immune mediated)

•   Clinical features**:** 5–10 days post-heparin (higher risk with unfractionated heparin than LMWH). Caused by an antibody to platelet factor 4-heparin complex, which causes the platelets to clump/clot. Platelet count falls by >50%. Can cause DVT, PE, stroke, and necrotic skin lesions at the heparin injection site.

•   Diagnosis**:** Calculate “4T score” to help predict risk (see online calculators). If 4T score is ≥4, send HIT assay.

•   Treatment**:** Moderate/high risk: Hold heparin products and start alternative anticoagulation (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux) right away – do not wait for HIT assay to return to switch anticoagulants\! Do NOT give platelets.

##### Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

•   Definition: Mixed platelet/coagulation disorder. See section below.
