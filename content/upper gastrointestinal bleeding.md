# upper gastrointestinal bleeding #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

* [[peptic ulcer disease]] (20â€“60%; duodenal>gastric)
* [[erosive gastropathy]] (4â€“30%)
* [[esophagitis]]
* [[esophageal or gastric varices]]
* [[portal HTN gastropathy]]
* [[vascular etiology of lower gastrointestinal bleeding]](5â€“10%)

## Malignancy (5%)
* Endoscopic hemostasis of mass temporizing measure till cancer Rx

## Mallory-Weiss tear (5â€“10%)
* GE jxn lacerations due to vomiting â†’ â†‘ intraabd pressure & shearing Often self-resolve; Rxâ†’ antiemetics, PPI, endoscopic therapy

## [[Cameronâ€™s lesions]]
* Linear erosions in hiatal hernia due to mech trauma of diaphragm

## * Post-sphincterotomy bleeding
* Occurs in ~2% of ERCP w/ sphincterotomy; â†‘ risk w/ more complic. procedure. Bleeding into duodenum. Rx w/ endo hemostasis.

> A Mallory-Weiss tear is a type of laceration that occurs in the mucosa of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, typically in the esophagus or the gastric cardia.
>> It is caused by forceful retching or vomiting and is often associated with alcohol abuse or other causes of gastric irritation.
>> The tear can lead to upper GI bleeding, which can range from mild to severe, depending on the size and location of the tear.
>> Treatment for a Mallory-Weiss tear typically involves controlling the bleeding, either with endoscopic techniques or, in severe cases, surgical intervention.
