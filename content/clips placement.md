# clips placement

- A clip placement is a marker placed in the breast, lymph node, or both.
- It locates and marks an area of concern that a doctor found on a mammogram or ultrasound.
- After chemotherapy shrinks the tumour and lymph node, the doctor can still find these areas of concern and remove them.
