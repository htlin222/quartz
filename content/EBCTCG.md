8. Other findings:

- Regimens with higher cumulative doses of anthracycline plus taxane provide the greatest benefits
- The proportional reductions in recurrence for taxane plus anthracycline were similar in estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative disease, and did not differ by age, nodal status, or tumor size or grade

9. Summary:
   An individual patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing taxane regimens with versus without anthracycline, and anthracycline regimens with versus without taxane, found that anthracycline plus taxane regimens are most efficacious at reducing breast cancer recurrence and death. The clearest reductions in recurrence were found when anthracycline was added concurrently to docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide. Regimens with higher cumulative doses of anthracycline plus taxane provide the greatest benefits, challenging the current trend in clinical practice and guidelines towards non-anthracycline chemotherapy, particularly shorter regimens. This meta-analysis provides a reliable evidence base to inform individual treatment decisions, clinical guidelines, and the design of future clinical trials.
