### Endocrine Axes

â€¢Â Â Â Organization: There are five parallel endocrine axes in the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary regulatory system (Figure 5.1)



**FIGURE 5.1:** Endocrine axes in the hypothalamicâ€“anterior pituitary regulatory system. There are five parallel endocrine axes in the hypothalamicâ€“anterior pituitary regulatory system that control the biosynthesis and release of 1) thyroid hormone, **2)** glucocorticoids, **3)** the sex steroids estradiol and testosterone, **4)** growth hormone, and **5)** prolactin. () indicates stimulatory action and () indicates inhibitory action. Abbreviations: TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; T4, thyroxine; T3, triiodothyronine; CRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone; VP, vasopressin; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; LH, luteinizing hormone; GHRH, growth hormone-releasing hormone; GH, growth hormone; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-BP3, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3.

â€¢Â Â Â Chapter organization: For the remainder of this chapter we will organize anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, and treatments by endocrine axis
