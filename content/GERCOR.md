# GERCOR

1. Design: Phase III trial, randomized, two sequences: FOLFIRI followed by FOLFOX6 (arm A), and FOLFOX6 followed by FOLFIRI (arm B).
2. Number of patients: 220 (109 in arm A and 111 in arm B).
3. Patient characteristics: Previously untreated patients with assessable metastatic colorectal cancer.
4. Agent:
   - FOLFIRI: folinic acid, FU, and irinotecan.
   - FOLFOX6: folinic acid, FU, and oxaliplatin.
5. Treatment line: First-line and second-line therapy.
6. Trial Name or NCT Number: Not reported.
7. Comparison of two groups:

| Outcome | Arm A | Arm B | P value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Median survival | 21.5 months | 20.6 months | 0.99 |
| Median second progression-free survival (PFS) | 14.2 months | 10.9 months | 0.64 |
| First-line therapy response rate (RR) | 56% | 54% | 0.26 |
| First-line therapy median PFS | 8.5 months | 8.0 months | Not reported |
| Second-line therapy RR | 4% | 15% | Not reported |
| Second-line therapy median PFS | 2.5 months | 4.2 months | Not reported |

Note: The toxicity profiles were different between the two groups, with FOLFIRI causing more frequent mucositis, nausea/vomiting, and alopecia, while FOLFOX6 causing more frequent neutropenia and neurosensory toxicity.
