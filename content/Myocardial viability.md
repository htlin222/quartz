# Myocardial viability

* Goal: identify hibernating myocardium that could regain fxn after revascularization
* Options: MRI (Se ~95%, Sp ~50%), PET (Se ~90%, Sp ~65%), dobutamine stress
echo (Se ~80%, Sp ~80%); SPECT/rest-redistribution (Se ~85%, Sp ~65%)
* Pts w/ ischemic CMP (EF <35%), viability predicts â†‘ EF w/ CABG but not survival or benefit of CABG vs. medical Rx (NEJM 2011;364:1617 & 2019;381:739)
