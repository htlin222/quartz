# stress ulcers of nutrition in the ICU #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

Patients in the ICU are at increased risk for stress ulcers.

## Risk factors include

shock, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation.

## To prevent stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding
patients are frequently started on prophylactic acid suppressive medications.
In a 2018 study, **regular pantoprazole use was not associated with a benefit in 30-day mortality**. However pantoprazole did reduce GI bleeding.
