### Other Systemic Disorders Associated with Nephrotic-Range Proteinuria

â€¢Â Â Â Diabetes:

-Â Â Â Leading cause of glomerular disease and kidney failure in the United States

-Â Â Â Hyperglycemia causes hyperfiltration through the glomeruli, leading to strain, scarring, proteinuria, and, eventually, a decrease in eGFR

-Â Â Â Glycemic control and treatment of proteinuria may slow CKD progression

â€¢Â Â Â Amyloidosis:

-Â Â Â Abnormally-folded proteins deposit in the glomeruli resulting in impaired function and proteinuria

-Â Â Â Dialysis-related amyloidosis is not typically a cause of nephrotic syndrome

â€¢Â Â Â HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN):

-Â Â Â Manifests as hematuria, proteinuria, edema with enlarged kidneys

-Â Â Â Collapsing FSGS on pathology

-Â Â Â Glucocorticoids for treatment are controversial

â€¢Â Â Â Lupus nephritis:

-Â Â Â Divided into six subclasses (class Iâ€“VI) based histological appearance. Nephrotic syndrome typically seen in class III to VI. Also see Rheumatology Chapter 9.

**â€¢**Â Â Â Class I: Minimal mesangial LN (no changes on light microscopy)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Class II: Mesangial proliferative LN (mesangial changes on light microscopy)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Class III: Focal LN (<50% of glomeruli involved)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Class IV: Diffuse LN (>50% of glomeruli involved)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Class V: Lupus membranous nephropathy (diffuse capillary wall thickening)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Class VI: Advanced sclerosing LN (90% sclerosing glomeruli, often bland urine sediment)
