# Flatbush diabetes


Flatbush diabetes, also known as ketosis-prone diabetes, is a form of type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by high levels of ketones in the blood, which can lead to ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Flatbush diabetes is more common in people of African descent, and it tends to occur at a younger age than other types of type 2 diabetes.
