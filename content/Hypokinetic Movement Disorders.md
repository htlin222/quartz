### Hypokinetic Movement Disorders

##### Parkinsonism

•   Symptoms: Syndrome of bradykinesia (\#1), rigidity, tremor, postural instability

•   Physical exam: Slowed responses (bradyphrenia), decreased blink rate, hypomimia (“masked facies”), slowed finger and toe taps, pill-rolling tremor (resting > postural), rigidity (cogwheel rigidity = rigidity with superimposed tremor), stooped posture, shuffling gait, en bloc turning, reduced arm swing

##### Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease

•   Pathophysiology: Gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra due to both genetic and environmental factors

•   Symptoms: Asymmetric resting tremor, bradykinesia, postural instability with falls, anosmia (lack of smell, often precedes motor symptoms), REM sleep behavior disorder, constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, nocturia

•   Treatment:

-   Carbidopa-levodopa: Start 0.5–1 tablet TID. Side effects: Worsened orthostatic hypotension, nausea, visual hallucinations. Comes in extended release formulation (good for motor fluctuations)

-   Entacapone: COMT inhibitor, prolongs effectiveness of carbidopa-levodopa

-   MAO-B inhibitors: Selegiline, rasagiline. Side effects: Hallucinations, orthostasis, insomnia

-   Dopamine agonists: Pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigitine. Side effects: Hallucinations, impulse control disorder

##### Parkinson-plus syndromes (atypical parkinsonism)

•   Lewy body dementia (LBD): Parkinsonism \+ fluctuating mental status \+ visual hallucinations

•   Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Early falls \+ vertical gaze limitation

•   Multiple aystem atrophy (MSA): Parkinsonism \+ prominent, early autonomic dysfunction

•   Corticobasal syndrome (CBS): Asymmetric rigidity/dystonia \+ cortical signs
