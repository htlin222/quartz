# Diagnosis gastroesophageal reflux disease

(Annals 2015;163:ITC1; Nat Rev Gastro Hepatol 2016;13:501)

- Clinical diagnosis based on sx and response to empiric trial of PPI (“PPI test”)
- EGD if: Ø response to PPI or alarm features: dysphagia, vomiting, ↓ wt, anemia, age >60
- If dx uncertain & EGD nl → esoph manometry w/ 24-h pH monitoring ± impedance to dx:
- do not respond to usual antireflux medications. or prior to invasive antireflux therapy
  - [[Ambulatory pH impedance monitoring]]

## Nonerosive reflux disease

- no erosion, ulceration or Barrett’s; ½ abnl pH.
- Unpredictable response to PPI.
- Most will not progress to erosive esophagitis or Barrett’s.

## Reflux hypersensitivity

- nl acid exposure on pH/impedance w/ symptom-reflux assoc.

## Functional heartburn

- nl acid exposure on pH/impedance w/o symptom-reflux assoc.
