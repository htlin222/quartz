# Treatment-ascites

* ↓ Na intake (**1–2 g/d**); restrict intake of free water if Na <125
* Diuretics: goal diurese ~1 L/d. Use **spironolactone ± furosemide in 5:2 ratio** (uptitrate as able); urine Na/K >1 implies effective natriuresis if Pt compliant w/ low-Na diet
* Avoid NSAIDs/ACEI/ARBs in cirrhosis because interfere w/ diuretic action
* Long-term albumin infusions ↓ mortality (Lancet 2018;391:2417), but not widely adopted

* If 2° to portal HTN: ↓ Na intake (<2 g/d) + diuretics; if refractory → LVP (serial) or TIPS

* If non–portal HTN related: depends on underlying cause (TB, malignancy, etc.)
*

* Treatment of ascites in patients with cirrhosis includes:
	* Abstinence from alcohol
	* Restricting dietary sodium
	* Treating with diuretics (algorithm 1)
	* Initial large-volume therapeutic paracentesis for patients with tense ascites
* Alcohol abstinence is important and may be improved with baclofen
* Sodium restriction to 88 mEq (2000 mg) per day is recommended, with diuretics added for most patients
* Medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and NSAIDs should be avoided or used with caution in patients with ascites
* Nonselective beta blockers may shorten survival in patients with refractory ascites and should be considered for discontinuation or avoidance.
