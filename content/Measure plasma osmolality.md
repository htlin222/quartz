title: Measure plasma osmolality

# Measure plasma osmolality

## Hypotonic (Posm <280) most common scenario; 
true excess of free H2O relative to Na

## Isotonic (Posm 280–295): 
rare lab artifact from 
* hyperlipidemia or 
* hyperproteinemia

## Hypertonic (Posm >295): 
excess of another effective osmole (eg, glucose, mannitol) that draws H2O intravascularly; 
* for each 100 mg/dL ↑ glc >100 mg/dL → ↓ [Na] by ~2 mEq/L
