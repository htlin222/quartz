# dairreha caused by ingestion of poorly absorbed cations or anions

Diarrhea caused by ingestion of poorly absorbed cations/anions or poorly absorbed carbohydrates - A type of osmotic diarrhea that occurs when the small intestine is not able to absorb certain substances, causing them to remain in the intestine and draw water into the intestine, leading to watery stools. Common causes include the ingestion of magnesium, sulfate, phosphorus (found in laxatives), mannitol, sorbitol (found in chewing gum), or lactose (if lactose intolerant).

Resolution with cessation of offending substance - The diarrhea symptoms usually resolve or improve when the patient stops consuming the substance causing the problem. This suggests that the substance is the main contributor to the diarrhea symptoms.
