### Medium Vessel Vasculitis

##### Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Incidence 3â€“4.5/100,000. Average age of onset 50 yr, M>F. Only 5% of cases are associated with HBV in the post-HBV vaccine era

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features:

-Â Â Â **Neuro** (75â€“80%): Mononeuritis multiplex or distal symmetric polyneuropathy

-Â Â Â **Constitutional** (65%): Fever, malaise, weight loss

-Â Â Â **Cutaneous** (50â€“60%): Livedo reticularis (lace-like rash), nodules, necrotic ulcers of the lower extremities

-Â Â Â **Renal** (40%): Can lead to hypertension, AKI/CKD if bilateral, hematuria, proteinuria

-Â Â Â **GI** (35â€“40%): Acute or chronic mesenteric ischemia

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis:

-Â Â Â Diagnosis confirmed with biopsy of involved tissue (e.g., sural nerve) showing focal segmental panmural necrotizing inflammation

-Â Â Â If there are no clear biopsy targets but GI or renal involvement is suspected, mesenteric or renal angiography can show a combination of aneurysms and stenoses at vessel branch points

-Â Â Â Avoid renal biopsy given high risk of bleeding with aberrant vasculature

-Â Â Â Inflammatory markers are typically elevated

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â Prednisone and cyclophosphamide for severe non-HBV associated cases

-Â Â Â Antivirals for HBV-related disease

##### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS)

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Incidence is 2.4/100,000 annually. Median age of onset is 50 yr

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Medium vessel vasculitis with isolated CNS involvement. Presents with triad of headache, cognitive impairment or altered mental status, and new or progressive focal neurologic deficits due to strokes

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: MRA or conventional angiography may show beading of CNS artery branches; the gold standard for diagnosis is a brain or leptomeningeal biopsy showing lymphocytic vessel wall inflammation

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: High-dose glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Permanent disability commonly occurs due to strokes.

##### Kawasaki disease

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features:

-Â Â Â Medium vessel vasculitis most common in children (80% of cases present prior to age 5 yr), typically Asian boys

-Â Â Â Manifestations include high fevers, conjunctivitis, mucositis (strawberry tongue), non-suppurative cervical adenitis, truncal rash, and plamar/plantar erythema

-Â Â Â Coronary aneurysms occur in 25% of cases

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â IVIG and aspirin. Excellent prognosis

-Â Â Â Coronary aneurysms may develop and cause CHF and/or need for CABG in adulthood
