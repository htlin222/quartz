# mechanism_of_crs

CRS occurs when immune cells, including T cells and macrophages, are activated during immunotherapy. This activation results in the release of large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±). These cytokines can amplify the immune response, creating a feedback loop that further enhances cytokine production and leads to widespread inflammation throughout the body
