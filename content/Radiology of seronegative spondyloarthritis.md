# Radiology of seronegative spondyloarthritis

- MRI preferred for early detection of inflammation (sacroiliitis)
- Plain films detect late structural changes (SI erosions/sclerosis)
- Calcification of spinal ligaments with bridging symmetrical syndesmophytes (known as "bamboo spine")
- Squaring and generalized demineralization of vertebral bodies (known as "shiny corners")
