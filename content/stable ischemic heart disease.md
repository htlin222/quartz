# stable ischemic heart disease

## Definition

> SIHD refers to asx and stably sx Pts as well as low-risk new-onset chest pain felt to be due to IHD, and excludes Pts w/ rapidly progressive sx or rest sx (ie, ACS)

## Noninvasive testing (Circ 2012;126:e354 & 2021;144;e368)

- Noninvasive dx testing most valuable when pretest probability is intermediate (variably defined as anywhere from 30–70% to 10–90%)
- Several pretest probability scores that take into account age, sex, nature of sx, risk factors
- Exercise ECG testing or CAC reasonable in some low-risk Pts
- In intermediate/high-risk Pts, stress test w/ imaging or CCTA (see “Noninv Eval of CAD”)
- If known nonobstructive CAD & stable chest pain: stress testing or CCTA ± FFR
- If obstructive CAD & stable chest pain: stress testing or invasive angio if high-risk CAD
