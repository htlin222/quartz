### WBC Disorders

**Leukopenia**

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Low WBC (<4K/Î¼l). If absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000/Î¼l, that is called neutropenia and carries an increased risk of infection. Severe neutropenia is when the ANC <500/Î¼l.

â€¢Â Â Â Differential diagnosis**:**

-Â Â Â Infection: Often causes leukocytosis, but can cause leukopenia

-Â Â Â Malignancy: Bone marrow infiltration

-Â Â Â Inflammatory/autoimmune conditions: SLE, others

-Â Â Â Medications: Chemotherapy, antibiotics, anti-epileptics, and substances (e.g., alcohol) can all be myelosuppressive

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat underlying condition. Patients with ANC <500/Î¼l typically require urgent workup even if asymptomatic.

##### **Leukocytosis**

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: High WBC (>10K/Î¼l)

â€¢Â Â Â Differential diagnosis:

-Â Â Â Infection

-Â Â Â Malignancy: If very high WBC, consider acute leukemia

-Â Â Â Inflammatory/autoimmune conditions

-Â Â Â De-margination: Stress response, steroids

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Treat underlying condition. Leukocytosis itself does not require treatment except in hyperleukocytosis related to leukemia, for which hydroxyurea and leukapheresis may be indicated.
