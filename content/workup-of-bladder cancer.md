# workup-of-bladder cancer

- Evaluation of entire urinary tract:
  - Cystourethroscopy,
  - consider urine cytology (low sensitivity âˆ¼34%, high specificity âˆ¼98%) (Urology 2003;61:109),
  - abd & upper tract imaging
- Initial cystoscopy includes bimanual exam under anesthesia to assess for locally advanced dz,
  - bladder wash for cytology,
  - visual inspection & tumors biopsied or transurethral resection,
  - random bxs if positive urine cytology w/ no visible tumors
- If no muscle in specimen,
  - strongly consider repeat TURBT-aim to correctly identify stage & grade while completely resecting all visible tumors
- UC are either low-grade or high-grade, w/ muscle-invasive dz almost always high-grade
