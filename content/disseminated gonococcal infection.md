## Additional diagnostic studies

- Synovial fluid: WBC >50k (but can be <10k), poly predominant
  Gram stain âŠ• in ~25%; culture âŠ• in up to 50% if done w/ Thayer-Martin media
- Blood culture: 
    - more likely âŠ• in arthritis-dermatitis syndrome;
	- rarely in joint-localized disease
- Gram stain and culture of skin lesions occasionally âŠ•
- Cervical, urethral, pharyngeal, rectal PCR or cx on Thayer-Martin media; âœ“ Chlamydia

## Treatment

- Ceftriaxone Ã— 7-14 d w/ empiric doxycycline Ã— 7 d for Chlamydia if co-infection has not been excluded (see [[STI]])
- Joint arthroscopy/lavage may be required for purulent arthritis; rarely >1 time
