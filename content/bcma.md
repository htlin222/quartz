# bcma

B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) has emerged as a promising target for MM therapies. Currently, the three most common treatment modalities for targeting BCMA are bispecific antibody constructs including BiTEÂ® (bispecific T-cell engager) immuno-oncology therapies, antibodyâ€“drug conjugates (ADCs), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T-cell therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of therapies from these classes that have presented or published clinical data, including the BiTEÂ® molecule AMG 420, the ADC GSK2857916, and several CAR T-cell therapies including NIH CAR-BCMA, bb2121, and LCAR-B38M.
