Smart Stop: Lenalidomide, [[tafasitamab.md|Tafasitamab]], Rituximab, and [[acalabrutinib.md|Acalabrutinib]] Alone and with Combination Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

- **Design**: Phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial
- **Number of patients**: 30 (Cohort 1)
- **Patients characteristics**: Patients 18 years or older with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
- **Agent**: Lenalidomide, tafasitamab, rituximab, and acalabrutinib (LTRA) with or without CHOP therapy
- **Treatment line**: First-line therapy
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: Smart Stop trial (NCT04978584)

**Results**

- **Endpoints**
  - 1A: Overall Response Rate (ORR) after 4 cycles of LTRA
  - 1B: Complete Response Rate (CRR) at the end of therapy
- **Interim results**
  - ORR after 4 cycles of LTRA: 100%
  - CRR after 4 cycles of LTRA: 64%
  - CRR at the end of therapy: 100%

**Other findings**

- 47% of patients experienced rash (13% grade 3)
- 40% of patients required a dose reduction of lenalidomide
- No patients have progressive lymphoma, including the first 6 patients with 3 and 6 month follow-up scans

**Summary**
The Smart Stop trial demonstrates that the combination of lenalidomide, tafasitamab, rituximab, and acalabrutinib is highly effective as an initial chemotherapy-free combination in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, and may allow for a response-adapted reduction in chemotherapy.
