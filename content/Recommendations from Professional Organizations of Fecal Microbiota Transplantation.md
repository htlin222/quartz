# Recommendations from Professional Organizations of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation

*   Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/SHEA)
*   fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) recommended in adult patients with â‰¥ 2 recurrences of *Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile* infection (CDI) who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments
*   consider FMT in pediatric patients with recurrent CDI after standard antibiotic treatments
*   Reference - [Clin Infect Dis 2018 Mar 19;66(7):e1][10][full-text][11], [Clin Infect Dis 2021 Sep 7;73(5):e1029][12]

European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) recommendations on use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in management of *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI) in adults
    *   consider fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with severe complicated CDI that have deteriorated despite CDI antibiotic treatment and surgery is not feasible, with decisions made case-by-case by multidisciplinary team ([ESCMID Weak recommendation, Very low-quality evidence][13])
    *   consider FMT after standard-of-care antibiotic pre-treatment in patients with multiple recurrence( [ESCMID Weak recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence][14])
        *   adequate multidisciplinary risk assessment needed
        *   FMT products should go through standardized preparation and screening
    *   Reference - [Clin Microbiol Infect 2021 Dec;27 Suppl 2:S1][15]
*   British Society of Gastroenterology/Healthcare Infection Society (BSG/HIS) recommendations on FMT for *C. difficile* infection
    *   recipient selection
        *   CDI history
            *   offer FMT to patients with recurrent CDI, including ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence][16])
                *   patients with â‰¥ 2 recurrences of *C. difficile* infection OR
                *   patients with 1 recurrence and risk factors for further recurrences, such as severe/complicated CDI
            *   strongly consider FMT in patients with refractory CDI ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence][17])
        *   treatment history
            *   do not offer FMT as initial therapy for CDI ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence][18])
            *   consider FMT for recurrent CDI only after ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence][19])
                *   symptom recurrence after resolution of an episode of CDI treated with â‰¥ 10 days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy
                *   consideration of treatment with extended/pulsed vancomycin and/or fidaxomicin
                *   consideration of treatment with medications associated with reduced risk of recurrence (such as, fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab) in patients with severe or complicated CDI
        *   comorbidities and immunosuppression
            *   avoid FMT in patients with history of anaphylactic food allergy ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Very low-quality evidence][20])
            *   consider FMT with caution in patients with CDI and decompensated chronic liver disease ([BSG/HIS Weak recommendation, Very low-quality evidence][21])
            *   offer FMT to patients with recurrent CDI and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with counselling on risks of IBD exacerbation ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence][22])
            *   in patients with immunosuppression or immunocompromise
                *   offer FMT with caution ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence][23])
                *   for immunocompromised recipients at risk of severe infection if exposed to cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus, choose donor negative for these viruses ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Very low-quality evidence][24])
            *   offer FMT to appropriate patients with recurrent CDI regardless of other comorbidities ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence][25])
    *   give further antimicrobial treatment for CDI for â‰¥ 72 hours prior to FMT ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence][26])
    *   use of banked, frozen FMT is preferred over fresh preparations for treatment of recurrent CDI infection ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence][27])
        *   frozen FMT material has a maximum shelf life of 6 months from preparation when stored at -80 degrees C (-112 degrees F) (recommended) ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence][28])
        *   consider thawing frozen samples at ambient temperature and use within 6 hours of thawing ([BSG/HIS Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence][29])
        *   avoid thawing frozen samples in warm water baths due to risks of cross-contamination and reduced bacterial viability ([BSG/HIS Weak recommendation, Very low-quality evidence][30])
    *   follow best practices for prevention of further transmission of CDI during administration of FMT, including enteric precautions and sporicidal treatment of endoscope and other instruments ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence][31])
    *   cure and treatment failure definitions
        *   record decision regarding cure/remission during follow-up, however, there is no universal definition and clinicians should decide on a case-by-case basis ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Very low-quality evidence][32])
        *   define treatment failure/recurrence on a case-by-case basis and routine testing for *C. difficile* toxin after FMT is not recommended, but may be considered in patients with persistent symptoms or suspected relapse ([BSG/HIS Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence][33])
    *   Reference - BSG/HIS guideline on use of fecal microbiota transplant as treatment for recurrent or refractory *C. difficile* infection ([Gut 2018 Nov;67(11):1920][34][PDF][35])
