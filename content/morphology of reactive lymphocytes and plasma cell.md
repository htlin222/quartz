  - Reactive lymphocyte
  - Reactive immunoblast
  - Plasmacytoid lymphocyte
  - Plasma cell

## Morphologic changes in reactive lymphocytes

- Shape and size
  - pleomorphic; heterogeneous population of various shapes and sizes increased cytoplasm quantity and basophilia
- Cytoplasm
  - presence of azurophilic granules, pale Golgi zone and cytoplasmic vacuoles
- Nucleus: variation in nuclear size and shape; irregular, elongated, stretched, occasionally round
  - chromatin: reduced chromatin condensation
  - nucleolus: presence of nucleolus

## Describle

- pale Golgi zone 白色的 → 枸杞粽
- cytoplasmic vacuoles 在質打泡
- Presence of nucleolus 求仁得仁
