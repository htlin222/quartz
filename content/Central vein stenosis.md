# Central vein stenosis

assoc. with longer HD duration, tunneled catheters. HeRO grafts bypass subclavian stenosis with flow into central vein (J Vasc Access 2016;17:138).

- **Central** vein **stenosis** ( **CVS** ) is a common **complication** of the central venous **catheter** ( **CVC** ) **placement** .
- The **prevalence** of **CVS** has mostly been studied in those who present with **symptoms** such as **swelling** of the **extremity** , **neck** and **breast** .
- **CVS** compromises arteriovenous **access** and can be resistant to **treatment** .
- A previous **history** of **CVC** **placement** is the most important **risk** **factor** for the **development** of **CVS** later .
- **Pacemaker** and **defibrillator** **wires** are associated with a high **incidence** of **CVS** .
- Increasingly liberal use of peripherally inserted central **catheters** ( **PICC** ) is likely to increase the **incidence** of **CVS** .
- The **trauma** and **inflammation** related to the **catheter** **placement** is thought to result in **microthrombi** **formation** , intimal **hyperplasia** and fibrotic **response** , with **development** of **CVS** .
- **Treatment** of **CVS** by endovascular **procedures** involves **angioplasty** of the **stenosis** .
- An elastic or recurrent **stenosis** may require a stent **placement** .
- The long-term **benefits** of the endovascular **procedures** , although improved with newer **technology** , remain modest .
- **Surgical** **options** are usually limited .
- **Future** **studies** to explore the **pathogenesis** and the **use** of novel **therapies** to prevent and treat **CVS** are needed .
- The **key** to reducing the **prevalence** of **CVS** is in reducing **CVC** **placement** and **placement** of arteriovenous **accesses** prior to initiating **dialysis** .
- Early **referral** of the **patients** to the **nephrologists** by the primary **care** **physicians** is important .
- Timely vein mapping and referral to the **surgeon** for fistula **creation** can obviate the **need** for a **CVC** and decrease **incidence** of **CVS** .
