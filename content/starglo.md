### Glofitamab Meets Primary Endpoint of Overall Survival in Phase 3 STARGLO Study for Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

**Information**

- **Design**: Phase 3, open-label, randomized trial
- **Number of patients**: Not specified
- **Patients characteristics**: Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who had received at least 1 line of therapy and are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant
- **Agent**: Glofitamab (Columvi; Genentech), a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody
- **Treatment line**: Second-line therapy or later
- **Trial Name or NCT Number**: STARGLO study (NCT04408638)

**Results**

- **Primary endpoint**: Overall survival (OS)
- **OS**: Met its primary endpoint of OS
- **Secondary endpoints**:
  - Progression-free survival (PFS)
  - Complete response rate
  - Objective response rate
  - Duration of objective response

**Other findings**

- **Safety**: The safety of the combination regimen was consistent with the known profiles of the individual medicines
- **Combination therapy**: Glofitamab is being investigated in combination with other drugs, such as polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy; Genentech), in earlier lines of treatment for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and other blood cancers

**Summary**
The phase 3 STARGLO study has met its primary endpoint of overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant. Glofitamab, a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, has demonstrated significant improvement in overall survival compared to the control arm. The study's results suggest that glofitamab may provide a new treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
