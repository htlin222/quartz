# Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenias

(Chest 2012;141:e495S; NEJM 2015;373:252)

## Type I Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenias(not clin. signif)

- Direct effect of heparin (non-immune)
- Incidence 10-20%
- After 1-4 d of heparin therapy
- Platelet nadir: >100,000/µL
- Sequelae: None
- Can continue heparin and observe

## Type II Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenias (clinically significant HIT)

- Immune (Ab)-mediated IgG against plt factor 4-heparin complex
- 1-3% with UFH, 0-0.8% LMWH
- After 4-10 d, but can occur in <24 h if prior exposure w/in 100 d (persistent Ab). Postop highest risk. Can occur after heparin d/c.
- ~60,000/µL, ↓ >50%
- Thrombotic events (HITT) in 30-50%
- Discontinue heparin
- Consider Alternative anticoagulation

## H/o HIT

if PF4 Ab ⊖ or SRA ⊖ (typically >100 d after dx) → may consider re-exposure to UFH (eg, for surgery); HIT recurrence low but can be seen (Blood 2014;123:2485)
