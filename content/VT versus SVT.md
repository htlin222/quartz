# VT versus SVT

- Electrocardiographic features that increase the likelihood of VT include:
- Absence of typical RBBB or LBBB morphology
- Extreme axis deviation (‚Äúnorthwest axis‚Äù): QRS positive in aVR and negative in I and aVF
- Very broad complexes > 160ms
- AV dissociation:
  - P and QRS complexes at ‚Ü£ different rates
  - P waves are often superimposed on QRS complexes and may be difficult to discern
- Capture beats: Occur when the sinoatrial node transiently ‚Äúcaptures‚Äù the ventricles in the midst of AV dissociation, producing a QRS complex of normal duration
- Fusion beats: Occur when a sinus and ventricular beat coincide to produce a hybrid complex (see Dressler beat)
