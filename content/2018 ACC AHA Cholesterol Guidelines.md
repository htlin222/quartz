# 2018 ACC AHA Cholesterol Guidelines

[ASCVD Risk Estimator +][1]

- [[primary prevention of clinical ASCVD in patients at increased risk but who have not had a vascular event]]
- [[secondary prevention of clinical ascvd in patients with preexisting occlusive vascular disease]]

Figure: ![🏞️][2]

## Population Recommendation

- Figure 2. [[Primary prevention]].

- [[risk-enhancing factors for clinician–patient risk discussion]]

## Very high-risk ASCVD\*

High-intensity statin; add EZE then PCSK9i if LDL-C ≥70

## Clinical ASCVD

High-intensity statin (? mod if >75 y), add EZE if LDL-C ≥70

## LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL

High-intensity statin; add EZE or PCKS9i if LDL-C ≥100

## DM, age 40–75 y

High-intensity statin (? moderate if no CV RFs)

## Age 40–75 y (and none of above); calc 10-y risk

≥20%: High-intensity statin
7.5%–<20%: Moderate-intensity statin; if uncertain consider CAC
5–<7.5%: Moderate-intensity statin reasonable
<5%: Emphasize lifestyle

ASCVD incl h/o ACS, stable angina, art. revasc, stroke, TIA, PAD. \*Multiple major ASCVD events (MI, stroke, sx PAD) or 1 major event + multiple high-risk conditions (age ≥65, DM, HTN, CKD, smoking, FH, prior PCI/CABG). 10-y CV Risk Score: <http://my.americanheart.org/cvriskcalculator>. Additional risk factors to consider: LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL, met. synd.,CKD, FHx premature ASCVD, hsCRP ≥2 mg/l, Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL, ABI <0.9, high-risk ethnic groups.
