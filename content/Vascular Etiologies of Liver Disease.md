### Vascular Etiologies of Liver Disease

##### Portal vein thrombosis

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Blood clot in the hepatic portal vein, which can lead to increased pressure in the portal venous system and reduced blood supply to the liver

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: RUQ ultrasound with Doppler

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Chronic PVT does not require treatment. Can consider anticoagulation for acute PVT after evaluation for varices.

##### Budd-Chiari syndrome

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Occlusion of the hepatic venous outflow by a thrombus. Associated with hypercoagulable states, such as polycythemia vera, pregnancy/OCPs, paroxysmal noctural hemoglobinuria

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical presentation: Severe RUQ pain, hepatomegaly, ascites, jaundice, acute liver failure

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: RUQ ultrasound with Doppler or hepatic venography

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Thrombolysis (i.e., anticoagulation) is first line; other options include percutaneous angiography with stenting, TIPS, surgical shunting, liver transplantation
