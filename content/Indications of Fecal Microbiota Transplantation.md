    *   severe disease without response to appropriate therapy after 48 hours
    *   moderate CDI without response to appropriate therapy (oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin) after 5 days (these patients typically have severe CDI or other cause of diarrhea)

    *   lack of evidence on safety in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mcL)
    *   FMT reported to be safe in other patients with immunocompromise
    *   very little evidence on safety of FMT in pregnant women so consider delaying until after birth
