  abstract = {This global phase 3 study compared lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) with a standard of care (SOC) as second-line therapy for primary refractory or early relapsed (ÔøΩÔøΩ12 months) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Adults eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT; N = 184) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to liso-cel (100 ÔøΩ 106 chimeric antigen receptor-positive T cells) or SOC (3 cycles of platinum-based immunochemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT in responders). The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS). In this primary analysis with a 17.5-month median follow-up, median EFS was not reached (NR) for liso-cel vs 2.4 months for SOC. Complete response (CR) rate was 74\% for liso-cel vs 43\% for SOC (P {$<$} .0001) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was NR for liso-cel vs 6.2 months for SOC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.400; P {$<$} .0001). Median overall survival (OS) was NR for liso-cel vs 29.9 months for SOC (HR = 0.724; P = .0987). When adjusted for crossover from SOC to liso-cel, 18-month OS rates were 73\% for liso-cel and 54\% for SOC (HR = 0.415). Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in 1\% and 4\% of patients in the liso-cel arm, respectively (no grade 4 or 5 events). These data show significant improvements in EFS, CR rate, and PFS for liso-cel compared with SOC and support liso-cel as a preferred second-line treatment compared with SOC in patients with primary refractory or early relapsed LBCL. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT03575351.},

  abstract = {The classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias was last updated in 2016 within a collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO), the Society for Hematopathology, and the European Association for Haematopathology. This collaboration was primarily based on input from a clinical advisory committees (CACs) composed of pathologists, hematologists, oncologists, geneticists, and bioinformaticians from around the world. The recent advances in our understanding of the biology of hematologic malignancies, the experience with the use of the 2016 WHO classification in clinical practice, and the results of clinical trials have indicated the need for further revising and updating the classification. As a continuation of this CAC-based process, the authors, a group with expertise in the clinical, pathologic, and genetic aspects of these disorders, developed the International Consensus Classification (ICC) of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias. Using a multiparameter approach, the main objective of the consensus process was the definition of real disease entities, including the introduction of new entities and refined criteria for existing diagnostic categories, based on accumulated data. The ICC is aimed at facilitating diagnosis and prognostication of these neoplasms, improving treatment of affected patients, and allowing the design of innovative clinical trials.},

Many older patients (pts) are not good candidates for intensive chemotherapy and are treated with TKIs plus corticosteroids or low intensity chemotherapy. Although the remission rates with this approach have been high, the median disease-free survival (DFS) has been short. Therefore, novel treatment strategies are needed. This trial evaluated the feasibility of combining the TKI dasatinib with prednisone and blinatumomab in older pts with Ph+ ALL.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Methods: This trial was activated through the NCTN in January 2015 and closed to accrual in April 2021. Pt eligibility included: age ÔøΩÔøΩ 65 years; Ph+ or Ph-like ALL (with dasatinib-sensitive fusions or mutations); newly diagnosed or relapsed/ refractory; no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease; and adequate organ function.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Treatment: For induction, pts received dasatinib 140 mg/d orally (PO) Days 1-56 along with prednisone 60 mg/m 2/d PO Days 1-24. Pts achieving complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) (Day 28 or Day 56) continued dasatinib until Day 84 followed by 3 cycles of post-remission therapy (PRT) with blinatumomab/ dasatinib. Pts not achieving CR or CRi by Day 56 received re-induction with blinatumomab. Response was assessed at Day 35 of blinatumomab. Pts not achieving CR/ CRi could receive a second cycle of blinatumomab. This was followed by 3 cycles of PRT with blinatumomab/ dasatinib. Maintenance therapy consisted of prednisone 60 mg/m 2/d x 5 days every 28 days for a total of 18 cycles along with dasatinib 140 mg po qd indefinitely.

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined as: \&amp;gt; Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities with the exception of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (if manageable with supportive care measures) or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \&amp;gt; 42 days with possible relationship to dasatinib or blinatumomab. If due to unexpected accrual, 12 pts were evaluable for DLT, the following rules would apply. If \&amp;gt; 4 of the 12 pts experienced a DLT, the study would be temporarily closed pending review. Upon re-opening, 8 additional eligible and evaluable pts would be enrolled for a total of 20 pts receiving blinatumomab.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Results: Due to rapid accrual, 16 pts enrolled before accrual was paused to assess feasibility and safety. Twelve pts were evaluable for DLT and 4 experienced a DLT: Grade 3 dyspnea and gastrointestinal pain (n=1), Grade 3 hypertension (n=1), Grade 3 dyspnea (n=1), Grade 3 hyperglycemia (n=1). These adverse events were deemed acceptable by the NCI and FDA and the study re-opened. A total of 25 eligible pts were accrued. The median age was 73 years (range 62-87). All pts were newly diagnosed. One pt was Ph-like, with the remainder being Ph+; 89\% of Ph+ pts had additional cytogenetic abnormalities. During induction, 2 pts experienced treatment-related non-hematologic Grade 4 toxicities. No Grade 4 or higher treatment-related non-hematologic toxicities occurred during post-remission therapy or maintenance. Twenty-three out of 25 pts (92\%) achieved a CR during dasatinib-based and prednisone induction therapy. Four did not receive PRT (2 due to adverse events, 1 to receive transplant, 1 because of insurance issues). Sixteen pts who achieved CR had MRD data. Five out of 16 pts (31\%) were MRD negative at Day 28. One pt remains on PRT and 10 are on maintenance. The median follow up for pts who are alive is 1.7 years. The median overall survival (OS) and DFS have not been reached as of July 8, 2021.

Although the combination of chemotherapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is now considered the standard of care in patients with Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, little is known about the impact of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs). Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated 1375 adult patients who underwent their first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the TKI era. In this study, 224 patients had ACAs (16.3\%). The ACAs that were seen in more than 20 cases (1.5\%) were as follows: -7, der(22), der(9), +8, and +X. Overall survival at 4 years was 56.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 49.4\% to 63.7\%) in the group with ACAs and 60.5\% (95\% CI, 57.3\% to 63.5\%) in the group without ACAs (PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.266). The cumulative incidence of relapse at 4 years was 28.9\% (95\% CI, 22.6\% to 35.6\%) in the group with ACAs and 21.9\% (95\% CI, 19.4\% to 24.6\%) in the group with Ph alone (PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.051). In multivariate analyses there were no statistically significant differences in the risk of overall mortality or risk of relapse between the groups with and without ACAs. In the subgroup analyses of specific ACAs, although the presence of +8 was associated with a higher relapse rate in univariate and multivariate analyses, no specific ACA was associated with poor overall survival. Further studies will be needed to verify the impact of specific ACAs on transplantation outcomes.},

  abstract = {Secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (SCNSL) is a rare but clinically challenging scenario with historically disappointing outcomes. SCNSL refers to lymphoma that has spread into the CNS concurrently with systemic disease or CNS relapse during or after frontline immunochemotherapy, presenting with or without systemic lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) denotes the most common entity, but an increased incidence is observed in other histologies, such as Burkitt lymphoma and mantle-cell lymphoma. The incidence, timing in disease course, location, evidence supporting the use of CNS prophylaxis, and treatment pathways vary according to histology. No randomized data exist to delineate the best treatment approaches with current recommendations based on retrospective and single-arm studies. However, a regimen comprising immunochemotherapy, incorporating agents that cross the blood-brain barrier, followed by thiotepa-containing conditioning and autologous stem-cell transplant outlined in the international MARIETTA study demonstrated improvement in outcomes, representing a major accomplishment in the care of patients with DLBCL with SCNSL. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cell denotes a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with systemic aggressive lymphomas, with emerging data also demonstrating efficacy without higher neurotoxicity in those with SCNSL. In this manuscript we discuss 5 clinical scenarios and review the evidence supporting our recommendations.},

We retrospectively analyzed data from a consecutive case series of adults with Ph+ ALL who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) at City of Hope between 2003 and 2014. Among 130 adults with Ph+ ALL who had TKI therapy before alloHCT, 78 patients had available data on conventional cytogenetics at diagnosis and were eligible for outcomes analysis. ACAs were observed in 41 patients (53\%). There were no statistically significant differences in median age, median initial WBC count, post-HCT TKI maintenance, or disease status at the time of transplant between the Ph-only and ACA cohorts; however, the Ph-only cohort had a higher rate of minimal residual disease positivity at the time of HCT. Three-year leukemia-free survival (79.8\% versus 39.5\%, PÔøΩ= .01) and 3-year overall survival (83\% versus 45.6\%, PÔøΩ= .02) were superior in the Ph-only cohort compared with the ACA cohort, respectively. Monosomy 7 was the most common additional aberration observed in our ACA cohort (nÔøΩ= 12). Thus, when TKI therapy and alloHCT are used as part of adult Ph+ ALL therapy, the presence of ACAs appears to have a significant deleterious effect on outcomes post-HCT.},

Registry studies have shown that advanced disease stage at transplantation is associated with inferior overall survival. To define the optimal timing of allogeneic HSCT, we carried out a decision analysis by studying 660 patients who received best supportive care and 449 subjects who underwent transplantation. Risk assessment was based on both the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and the World Health Organization classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS). We used a continuous-time multistate Markov model to describe the natural history of disease and evaluate the effect of allogeneic HSCT on survival. This model estimated life expectancy from diagnosis according to treatment policy at different risk stages. Relative to supportive care, estimated life expectancy increased when transplantation was delayed from the initial stages until progression to intermediate-1 IPSS-risk or to intermediate WPSS-risk stage, and then decreased for higher risks. Modeling decision analysis on WPSS versus IPSS allowed better estimation of the optimal timing of transplantation. These observations indicate that allogeneic HSCT offers optimal survival benefits when the procedure is performed before MDS patients progress to advanced disease stages. Am. J.

Disease presentation is rather vague, and the hallmark of treatment is early diagnosis before irreversible end-organ damage. Once diagnosed, treatment decision is transplant-driven whereby \textasciitilde 20\% of patients are eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with or without bortezomib-based induction.

In general, management of AL amyloidosis is aimed at achieving deep, durable responses with very close monitoring for early detection of relapse/refractory disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the management of patients with AL amyloidosis including goals of therapy, current treatment guidelines in the setting of both ASCT-eligibility and ineligibility, treatment response monitoring recommendations, toxicity management, and treatment of relapse/refractory disease.},

Given the heterogeneity of PTLD and the risk of infectious complications in patients with immunosuppression, the treatment of this disease remains challenging. Monomorphic PTLD and lymphoma of B-cell origin account for the majority of cases. Treatment strategies for PTLD consist of response-adapted, risk-stratified methods using immunosuppression reduction, immunotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. With this approach, ‚àº25\% of the patients do not need chemotherapy. Outcomes for patients with high risk or those who do not respond to frontline therapies remain dismal, and novel treatments are needed in this setting. PTLD is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in 60\% to 80\% of cases, making EBV-directed therapy an attractive treatment modality. Recently, the introduction of adoptive immunotherapies has become a promising option for refractory cases; hopefully, these treatment strategies can be used as earlier lines of therapy in the future.},

Design Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (TELESTO). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00940602). Setting 60 centers in 16 countries. Participants 225 patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 2247 pmol/L; prior receipt of 15 to 75 packed red blood cell units; and no severe cardiac, liver, or renal abnormalities. Intervention Deferasirox dispersible tablets (10 to 40 mg/kg per day) (n = 149) or matching placebo (n = 76). Measurements The primary end point was EFS, defined as time from date of randomization to first documented nonfatal event (related to cardiac or liver dysfunction and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia) or death, whichever occurred first. Results Median time on treatment was 1.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.5 to 3.1 years) in the deferasirox group and 1.0 year (IQR, 0.6 to 2.0 years) in the placebo group. Median EFS was prolonged by approximately 1 year with deferasirox versus placebo (3.9 years [95\% CI, 3.2 to 4.3 years] vs. 3.0 years [CI, 2.2 to 3.7 years], respectively; hazard ratio, 0.64 [CI, 0.42 to 0.96]). Adverse events occurred in 97.3\% of deferasirox recipients and 90.8\% of placebo recipients. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events (‚â•15 events per 100 patient treatment-years) in deferasirox versus placebo recipients, respectively, were 24.7 versus 23.9 for diarrhea, 21.8 versus 18.7 for pyrexia, 16.7 versus 22.7 for upper respiratory tract infection, and 15.9 versus 0.9 for increased serum creatinine concentration. Limitations The protocol was amended from a phase 3 to a phase 2 study, with a reduced target sample size from 630 to 210 participants. There was differential follow-up between treatment groups. Conclusion The findings support ICT in iron-overloaded patients with low- to intermediate-1-risk MDS, with longer EFS compared with placebo and a clinically manageable safety profile. Therefore, ICT may be considered in these patients. Primary funding source Novartis Pharma AG.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five-year follow-up in a trial involving patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classic Hodgkin's lymphoma showed long-term progression-free survival benefits with first-line therapy with brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate, plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD), as compared with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). A planned interim analysis indicated a potential benefit with regard to overall survival; data from a median of 6 years of follow-up are now available. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive up to six cycles of A+AVD or ABVD. The primary end point, modified progression-free survival, has been reported previously. The key secondary end point was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 664 patients were assigned to receive A+AVD and 670 to receive ABVD. At a median follow-up of 73.0 months, 39 patients in the A+AVD group and 64 in the ABVD group had died (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.88; P = 0.009). The 6-year overall survival estimates were 93.9\% (95\% CI, 91.6 to 95.5) in the A+AVD group and 89.4\% (95\% CI, 86.6 to 91.7) in the ABVD group. Progression-free survival was longer with A+AVD than with ABVD (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.86). Fewer patients in the A+AVD group than in the ABVD group received subsequent therapy, including transplantation, and fewer second cancers were reported with A+AVD (in 23 vs. 32 patients). Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was recommended after an increased incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed with A+AVD. More patients had peripheral neuropathy with A+AVD than with ABVD, but most patients in the two groups had resolution or amelioration of the event by the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received A+AVD for the treatment of stage III or IV Hodgkin's lymphoma had a survival advantage over those who received ABVD.

  abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues was last updated in 2008. Since then, there have been numerous advances in the identification of unique biomarkers associated with some myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias, largely derived from gene expression analysis and next-generation sequencing that can significantly improve the diagnostic criteria as well as the prognostic relevance of entities currently included in the WHO classification and that also suggest new entities that should be added. Therefore, there is a clear need for a revision to the current classification. The revisions to the categories of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia will be published in a monograph in 2016 and reflect a consensus of opinion of hematopathologists, hematologists, oncologists, and geneticists. The 2016 edition represents a revision of the prior classification rather than an entirely new classification and attempts to incorporate new clinical, prognostic, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic data that have emerged since the last edition. The major changes in the classification and their rationale are presented here.},

However, it remains unclear whether the Tim-3‚Äìgalectin-9 pathway is associated with the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Thus, we investigated the expression and function of Tim-3 and the clinical impact of its ligand galectin-9 in MDS. Tim-3 expression levels on MDS blasts by CD45/side-scatter or CD34/CD45 gating were increased as MDS progressed to the advanced stage. Tim-3 expression in the MDS blasts was upregulated in the presence of the cell culture supernatant of human stromal cells or the MDS-related cytokine transforming growth factor-Œ≤1. The proliferation of Tim-3 + MDS blasts was inhibited by the blockade of anti-Tim-3 antibody. Furthermore, plasma levels of galectin-9 were elevated as MDS progressed to the advanced stage in 70 MDS/acute leukemia transformed from MDS patients and was a prognostic factor in 40 MDS patients. Our data demonstrated that the Tim-3-galectin-9 pathway is associated with the pathogenesis and disease progression of MDS. These findings provide new insight into potential immunotherapy targeting the galectin-9‚ÄìTim-3 pathway in MDS.}

Objective The Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) submitted a study concept comparing the outcomes of patients aged 55 to 64 years vs aged 65 years or older who met those criteria, effectively providing coverage by CMS for HCT for MDS. Design, Setting, and Participants Data on patients aged 65 years or older were prospectively collected and their outcomes compared with patients aged 55 to 64 years. Patients were enrolled in the study from December 15, 2010, to May 14, 2014. The results reported herein were analyzed as of September 4, 2017, with a median follow-up of 47 months. The study was conducted by the CIBMTR. It comprises a voluntary working group of more than 420 centers worldwide that contribute detailed data on allogeneic and autologous HCT and cellular therapies. Interventions Patients with MDS received HCT according to institutional guidelines and preferences. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was overall survival (OS); secondary outcomes included nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse-free survival, and acute and chronic graft vs host disease. Results During the study period, 688 patients aged 65 years or older underwent HCT for MDS and were compared with 592 patients aged 55 to 64 years. Other than age, there were no differences in patient and disease characteristics between the groups. On univariate analysis, the 3-year NRM rate was 28\% vs 25\% for the 65 years or older group vs those aged 55 to 64 years, respectively. The 3-year OS was 37\% vs 42\% for the 65 years or older group vs the 55 to 64 years age group, respectively. On multivariable analysis after adjusting for excess risk of mortality in the older group, age group had no significant association with OS (HR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.27;P\,=\,.23) or NRM (HR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.93-1.52;P\,=\,.16). Conclusions and Relevance Older patients with MDS undergoing HCT have similar OS compared with younger patients. Based on current data, we would recommend coverage of HCT for MDS by the CMS.

  abstract = {Purpose We aimed to study prognostic factors and efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first remission of patients with noninfant childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements treated with chemotherapy regimens between 1995 and 2010. Patients and Methods Data were retrospectively retrieved from 629 patients with 11q23/KMT2A-rearranged ALL from 17 members of the Ponte-di-Legno Childhood ALL Working Group. Clinical and biologic characteristics, early response assessed by minimal residual disease at the end of induction (EOI) therapy, and allo-HSCT were analyzed for their impact on outcomes. Results A specific 11q23/KMT2A translocation partner gene was identified in 84.3\% of patients, with the most frequent translocations being t(4;11)(q21;q23) (n = 273; 51.5\%), t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) (n = 106; 20.0\%), t(9;11)(p21\_22;q23) (n = 76; 14.3\%), t(6;11)(q27;q23) (n = 20; 3.8\%), and t(10;11)(p12;q23) (n = 14; 2.6\%); 41 patients (7.7\%) had less frequently identified translocation partner genes. Patient characteristics and early response varied among subgroups, indicating large biologic heterogeneity and diversity in therapy sensitivity among 11q23/KMT2A-rearranged ALL. The EOI remission rate was 93.2\%, and the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for the entire cohort was 69.1\% ¬± 1.9\%, with a range from 41.7\% ¬± 17.3\% for patients with t(9;11)-positive T-ALL (n = 9) and 64.8\% ¬± 3.0\% for patients with t(4;11)-positive B-ALL (n = 266) to 91.2\% ¬± 4.9\% for patients with t(11;19)-positive T-ALL (n = 34). Low EOI minimal residual disease was associated with favorable EFS, and induction failure was particularly predictive of nonresponse to further therapy and relapse and poor EFS. In addition, EFS was not improved by allo-HSCT compared with chemotherapy only in patients with both t(4;11)-positive B-ALL (n = 64 v 51; P = .10) and 11q23/KMT2A-rearranged T-ALL (n = 16 v 10; P = .69). Conclusion Compared with historical data, prognosis of patients with noninfant 11q23/KMT2A-rearranged ALL has improved, but allo-HSCT failed to affect outcome. Targeted therapies are needed to reduce relapse and treatment-related mortality rates.},

There is no preferred palliative-intent treatment for patients in this setting. Patients and Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed using the nationwide de-identified electronic health record-derived Flatiron Health database. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated for patients with R/R DLBCL who were ineligible for and/or failed autologous stem cell transplantation in the second line and received bendamustine, gemcitabine, or lenalidomide. Results Three hundred eighty-three patients were included. Therapy received was bendamustine in 158 patients, gemcitabine in 142 patients, and lenalidomide in 83 patients. The median EFS and OS for all patients was 4.1 months and 8.7 months, respectively. Compared with patients receiving bendamustine or gemcitabine, those receiving lenalidomide demonstrated significantly longer median EFS (6.8 vs. 3.8 months; PÔøΩ=ÔøΩ.006) and median OS (15.4 vs. 7.7 months; PÔøΩ= .045). Survival outcomes were also improved for lenalidomide-treated patients specifically in the second- as well as third- or fourth-line settings. Conclusion Use of lenalidomide resulted in prolonged EFS and OS as compared with bendamustine or gemcitabine in this cohort of patients with R/R DLBCL receiving palliative therapy. This first large-scale analysis of real-world outcomes for this patient population may guide current clinical management as well as serve as a benchmark for survival outcomes in the standard-of-care setting, which may aid in the design of future clinical trials.},

Here, we present a next generation CD20-targeting TCB (CD20-TCB) with significantly higher potency and a novel approach enabling safer administration of such potent drug. Experimental design: We developed CD20-TCB based on the 2:1 TCB molecular format and characterized its activity pre-clinically. We also applied a single administration of obinutuzumab (Gazyva pre-treatment, Gpt) prior to the first infusion of CD20-TCB as a way to safely administer such a potent drug. Results: CD20-TCB is associated with a long half-life and high potency enabled by high-avidity bivalent binding to CD20 and head-to-tail orientation of B and T cell binding domains in a 2:1 molecular format. CD20-TCB displays considerably higher potency than other CD20-TCB antibodies in clinical development and is efficacious on tumor cells expressing low levels of CD20. CD20-TCB also displays potent activity in primary tumor samples with low effector:target ratios. In vivo, CD20-TCB regresses established tumors of aggressive lymphoma models. Gpt enables profound B cell depletion in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs and reduces T cell activation and cytokine release in the peripheral blood thus increasing the safety of CD20-TCB administration. Gpt is more efficacious and safer than SUD. Conclusions: CD20-TCB and Gpt represent a potent and safer approach for treatment of lymphoma patients and are currently being evaluated in Phase I, multicenter study in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL (NCT03075696).},

In this study, we analyzed the outcome of 809 patients with R/R DLBCL after two or more previous lines of treatment who had a commercial chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells order for axi-cel or tisa-cel and were registered in the retrospective French DESCAR-T registry study (NCT04328298). After 1:1 propensity score matching (n\,=\,418), the best overall response rate/complete response rate (ORR/CRR) was 80\%/60\% versus 66\%/42\% for patients treated with axi-cel compared to tisa-cel, respectively (P\,{$<$}\,0.001 for both ORR and CRR comparisons). After a median follow-up of 11.7\,months, the 1-year progression-free survival was 46.6\% for axi-cel and 33.2\% for tisa-cel (hazard ratio (HR)\,=\,0.61; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.46‚Äì0.79; P\,=\,0.0003). Overall survival (OS) was also significantly improved after axi-cel infusion compared to after tisa-cel infusion (1-year OS 63.5\% versus 48.8\%; HR\,=\,0.63; 95\% CI, 0.45‚Äì0.88; P\,=\,0.0072). Similar findings were observed using the inverse probability of treatment weighting statistical approach. Grade 1‚Äì2 cytokine release syndrome was significantly more frequent with axi-cel than with tisa-cel, but no significant difference was observed for grade ‚â•3. Regarding immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), both grade 1‚Äì2 and grade ‚â•3 ICANS were significantly more frequent with axi-cel than with tisa-cel. In conclusion, our matched comparison study supports a higher efficacy and also a higher toxicity of axi-cel compared to tisa-cel in the third or more treatment line for R/R DLBCL.},

The median age of patients was 67Áπö0 years (IQR 57Áπö0-73Áπö0); 101 (70\%) were male and 44 (30\%) were female; most participants were White (119 [82\%]) and not Hispanic or Latino (132 [91\%]). 42 (29\%) patients received previous CAR T therapy and 119 (82\%) were refractory to the last line of therapy. Median duration of follow-up was 4Áπö2 months (IQR 1Áπö5-11Áπö5). During dose escalation, odronextamab was administered up to the maximum dose of 320 mg once per week and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The recommended dose for expansion in patients with follicular lymphoma grade 1-3a was 80 mg and was 160 mg for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Cytokine release syndrome and neurological treatment-emergent adverse events were predominantly low grade and did not result in treatment discontinuation. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia (36 [25\%]), lymphopenia (28 [19\%]), hypophosphataemia (27 [19\%]), neutropenia (27 [19\%]), and thrombocytopenia (20 [14\%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 89 (61\%) of 145 patients; the most frequent were cytokine release syndrome (41 [28\%]), pyrexia (11 [8\%]), pneumonia (nine [6\%]), and infusion-related reaction (six [4\%]). Four deaths were considered related to treatment (gastric perforation in a patient with gastric involvement by lymphoma, lung infection, pneumonia, and tumour-lysis syndrome). Objective response rate was 51\% (95\% CI 42-59; 72 of 142). In patients with follicular lymphoma who received odronextamab doses of 5 mg or higher, the objective response rate was 91\% (95\% CI 75-98; 29 of 32) and the complete response rate was 72\% (95\% CI 53-86; 23 of 32). In patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without previous CAR T-cell therapy who received doses of 80 mg or higher, the objective response rate was 53\% (eight of 15) and all responses were complete responses.

Patients (‚â•65 years) with previously untreated CLL, without del(17p), were randomly assigned 1:1 to once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity (n = 136) or chlorambucil 0.5-0.8 mg/kg ‚â§12 cycles (n = 133). With up to 8 years of follow-up (range, 0.1-96.6 months; median, 82.7 months), significant PFS benefit was sustained for ibrutinib vs chlorambucil (hazard ratio [HR], 0.154; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.108-0.220). At 7~years, PFS was 59\% for ibrutinib vs 9\% for chlorambucil.

Rituximab monotherapy and fludarabine-rituximab in combination are documented treatment options. In a prospective, nonrandomized multicenter trial, 45 eligible patients received rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 1 and bendamustine 90 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 for 4 cycles at a 28-day interval. Thirty-two patients (71\%) responded; 18 (40\%) achieved complete response (CR) and 14 (31\%) partial response (PR). Among 14 patients previously treated with rituximab or fludarabine-rituximab, 7 (50\%) responded to bendamustine-rituximab (3 CR and 4 PR). Hemoglobin levels increased by a median of 4.4 g/dL in the complete responders, 3.9 g/dL in those achieving PR, and 3.7 g/dL in the whole cohort. The 10th percentile of response duration was not reached after 32 months. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 15 patients (33\%), but only 5 (11\%) experienced infection with or without neutropenia. Thirteen patients (29\%) had their dose of bendamustine reduced.

  abstract = {The last decades have seen great progress in the treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Comparative trials are lacking, and recommendations must be based mainly on nonrandomized trials and will be influenced by personal experience. Herein, current treatment options are reviewed and linked to 3 cases, each addressing specific aspects of therapy. Two major steps in CAD pathogenesis are identified, clonal B-cell lymphoproliferation and complement-mediated hemolysis, each of which constitutes a target of therapy. Although drug treatment is not always indicated, patients with symptomatic anemia or other bothersome symptoms should be treated. The importance of avoiding ineffective therapies is underscored. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat CAD. Studies on safety and efficacy of relevant drugs and combinations are briefly described. The author recommends that B cell‚Äìdirected approaches remain the first choice in most patients requiring treatment. The 4-cycle bendamustine plus rituximab combination is highly efficacious and sufficiently safe and induces durable responses in most patients, but the time to response can be many months. Rituximab monotherapy should be preferred in frail patients. The complement C1s inhibitor sutimlimab is an emerging option in the second line and may also find its place in the first line in specific situations.},

Over the last few years, ibrutinib has developed from a promising drug candidate to being approved by FDA for the treatment of three B cell malignancies, a truly remarkable feat. Few, if any medicines are monospecific and ibrutinib is no exception; already during ibrutinib's initial characterization, it was found that it could bind also to other kinases. In this review, we discuss the implications of such interactions, which go beyond the selective effect on BTK in B cell malignancies. In certain cases, the outcome of ibrutinib treatment likely results from the combined inhibition of BTK and other kinases, causing additive or synergistic, effects. Conversely, there are also examples when the clinical outcome seems unrelated to inhibition of BTK. Thus, more specifically, adverse effects such as enhanced bleeding or arrhythmias could potentially be explained by different interactions. We also predict that during long-term treatment bone homoeostasis might be affected due to the inhibition of osteoclasts.

However, treatment paradigms for HL are rapidly changing with positron emission tomography-adapted therapy, as well as the incorporation of brentuximab vedotin and checkpoint inhibitors into frontline, salvage, and maintenance therapy for HL. Patients who relapse or are refractory to these novel agents are likely to have different responses and outcomes with AHCT than the 3-year event-free survivals of 50\% historically reported with AHCT for patients failing conventional combination chemotherapy. This article reviews the current data on the efficacy of AHCT, pretransplant prognostic markers, pretransplant salvage regimens, peritransplant radiation therapy, and posttransplant maintenance therapy in classic HL. Future research should reexamine the efficacy, timing, risk factors, pretransplant salvage regimens, and maintenance approaches posttransplant in the era of brentuximab vedotin and checkpoint inhibitors for HL.},

  abstract = {Secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (SCNSL) is defined by the involvement of the CNS, either at the time of initial diagnosis of systemic lymphoma or in the setting of relapse, and can be either isolated or with synchronous systemic disease. The risk of CNS involvement in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is approximately 5\%; however, certain clinical and biological features have been associated with a risk of up to 15\%. There has been growing interest in improving the definition of patients at increased risk of CNS relapse, as well as identifying effective prophylactic strategies to prevent it. SCNSL often occurs within months of the initial diagnosis of lymphoma, suggesting the presence of occult disease at diagnosis in many cases. The differing presentations of SCNSL create the therapeutic challenge of controlling both the systemic disease and the CNS disease, which uniquely requires agents that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Outcomes are generally poor with a median overall survival of approximately 6 months in retrospective series, particularly in those patients presenting with SCNSL after prior therapy. Prospective studies of intensive chemotherapy regimens containing high-dose methotrexate, followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have shown the most favorable outcomes, especially for patients receiving thiotepa-based conditioning regimens. However, a proportion of patients will not respond to induction therapies or will subsequently relapse, indicating the need for more effective treatment strategies. In this review we focus on the identification of high-risk patients, prophylactic strategies and recent treatment approaches for SCNSL. The incorporation of novel agents in immunochemotherapy deserves further study in prospective trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) without malignant relapse is the overall goal of allogeneic haemopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We aimed to evaluate regimens using either maraviroc, bortezomib, or post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for GvHD prophylaxis compared with controls receiving the combination of tacrolimus and methotrexate using a novel composite primary endpoint to identify the most promising intervention to be further tested in a phase 3 trial. METHODS: In this prospective multicentre phase 2 trial, adult patients aged 18-75 years who received reduced-intensity conditioning HCT were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by random block sizes to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on days 3 and 4, followed by tacrolimus starting on day 5 and mycophenolate mofetil starting on day 5 at 15 mg/kg three times daily not to exceed 1 g from day 5 to day 35); tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib (bortezomib 1¬∑3 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 4, and 7 after HCT); or tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc (maraviroc 300 mg orally twice daily from day -3 to day 30 after HCT). Methotrexate was administered as a 15 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on days 3, 6, and 11 after HCT; tacrolimus was given intravenously at a dose of 0¬∑05 mg/kg twice daily (or oral equivalent) starting on day -3 (except the post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, as indicated), with a target level of 5-15 ng/mL. Tacrolimus was continued at least until day 90 and was tapered off by day 180. Each study group was compared separately to a contemporary non-randomised prospective cohort of patients (control group) who fulfilled the same eligibility criteria as the trial, but who were treated with tacrolimus and methotrexate at centres not participating in the trial. The primary endpoint (GvHD-free, relapse-free survival [GRFS]) was defined as the time from HCT to onset of grade 3-4 acute GvHD, chronic GvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression, disease relapse, or death. The study was analysed by modified intention to treat. The study is closed to accrual and this is the planned analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02208037. FINDINGS: Between Nov 17, 2014, and May 18, 2016, 273 patients from 31 US centres were randomly assigned to the three study arms: 89 to tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; 92 to tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc; 92 to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; and six were excluded. Between Aug 1, 2014, and Sept 14, 2016, 224 controls received tacrolimus and methotrexate. Controls were generally well matched except for more frequent comorbidities than the intervention groups and a different distribution of types of conditioning regimens used. Compared with controls, the hazard ratio for GRFS was 0¬∑72 (90\% CI 0¬∑54-0¬∑94; p=0¬∑044) for tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, 0¬∑98 (0¬∑76-1¬∑27; p=0¬∑92) for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib, and 1¬∑10 (0¬∑86-1¬∑41; p=0¬∑49) for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc. 238 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities: 12 (13\%) had grade 3 and 67 (73\%) grade 4 events with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; ten (11\%) had grade 3 and 68 (76\%) had grade 4 events with tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; and 18 (20\%) had grade 3 and 63 (68\%) had grade 4 events with tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc. The most common toxicities were haematological (77 [84\%] for tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; 73 [82\%] for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; and 78 [85\%] for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc) and cardiac (43 [47\%], 44 [49\%], and 43 [47\%], respectively). INTERPRETATION: Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide was the most promising intervention, yielding the best GRFS; this regimen is thus being prospectively compared with tacrolimus and methotrexate in a phase 3 randomised trial.

  abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Here, using whole-genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing of 2,754\,childhood patients with ALL, we find that, despite a generally low mutation burden, ALL cases harbor a median of four putative somatic driver alterations per sample, with 376\,putative driver genes identified varying in prevalence across ALL subtypes. Most samples harbor at least one rare gene alteration, including 70\,putative cancer driver genes associated with ubiquitination, SUMOylation, noncoding transcripts and other functions. In hyperdiploid B-ALL, chromosomal gains are acquired early and synchronously before ultraviolet-induced mutation. By contrast, ultraviolet-induced mutations precede chromosomal gains in B-ALL cases with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome\,21. We also demonstrate the prognostic significance of genetic alterations within subtypes. Intriguingly, DUX4- and KMT2A-rearranged subtypes separate into CEBPA/FLT3- or NFATC4-expressing subgroups with potential clinical implications. Together, these results deepen understanding of the ALL genomic landscape and associated outcomes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To evaluate prospectively in patients with follicular lymphoma and a low tumor burden three therapeutic options: delay of any treatment until clinically meaningful progression, immediate treatment with an oral alkylating agent, or treatment with a biologic response modifier, interferon alfa-2b. PATIENTS AND METHODS Newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma patients with a low tumor burden (n = 193) were randomly assigned to one of three arms: arm 1, no initial treatment (n = 66); arm 2, prednimustine 200 mg/m2/d for 5 days per month for 18 months (n = 64); or arm 3, interferon alfa 5 MU/d for 3 months then 5 MU three times per week for 15 months (n = 63). Clinical characteristics were similar in the three arms. RESULTS Overall response rates with prednimustine and interferon alfa were 78\% and 70\%, respectively. The overall response to therapy, when deferred, was similar at 70\%. With a median follow-up duration of 45 months after randomization, the median freedom-from-treatment (FFT) interval was 24 months in arm 1 and the interval of freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) was 40 months in arm 2 and 35 months in arm 3. The median overall survival time was not reached and the overall survival rate at 5 years was 78\% in arm 1, 70\% in arm 2, and 84\% in arm 3. Therefore, deferred treatment does not adversely influence survival at 5 years. Patients who progressed within 1 year had a significantly shorter survival duration (median, 48 months). CONCLUSION Delayed treatment is feasible in patients with follicular lymphoma and a low tumor burden. For patients with early progression, more intensive therapy should be considered. For others, because delay of treatment until significant clinical progression does not seem to hamper the prognosis or subsequent response to treatment, the long-term toxicity of alkylating agents can be reduced.},

Autoantibodies in patients with WAHA (panagglutinins) typically lack specificity, in contrast to alloantibodies that are typically specific for red-cell antigens. Several retrospective studies have shown that the absolute risk of venous thromboembolic events (pulmonary emboli and deep venous thrombosis) is 15 to 30\% among adult patients with WAHA. Prompt transfusion of ABO- and RhD-matched blood is warranted for patients with WAHA and severe anemia (hemoglobin level {$<$}6 g per deciliter). First-line therapy involves glucocorticoids and rituximab. In two randomized, controlled trials, glucocorticoid therapy plus rituximab was superior to glucocorticoid monotherapy as first-line treatment for WAHA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies on the efficacy of rituximab in primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) reported conflicting results. Our international randomized phase 3 study showed that the addition of rituximab to high-dose methotrexate, BCNU, teniposide, and prednisolone (MBVP) in PCNSL was not efficacious in the short term. Here we present long-term results after a median follow-up of 82.3 months. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-nine eligible newly diagnosed, nonimmunocompromised patients with PCNSL aged 18-70 years with WHO performance status 0-3 was randomized between treatment with MBVP chemotherapy with or without rituximab, followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation in responding patients, and reduced-dose WBRT in patients aged\>‚â§\>60 years. Event-free survival was the primary endpoint. Overall survival rate, neurocognitive functioning (NCF), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were additionally assessed, with the IPCG test battery, EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20 questionnaires, respectively. RESULTS: For event-free survival, the hazard ratio was 0.85, 95\% CI 0.61-1.18, P\>=\>.33. Overall survival rate at 5 years for MBVP and R-MBVP was 49\% (39-59) and 53\% (43-63) respectively. In total, 64 patients died in the MBVP arm and 55 in the R-MBVP arm, of which 69\% were due to PCNSL. At the group level, all domains of NCF and HRQoL improved to a clinically relevant extent after treatment initiation, and remained stable thereafter up to 60 months of follow-up, except for motor speed which deteriorated between 24 and 60 months. Although fatigue improved initially, high levels persisted in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up confirms the lack of added value of rituximab in addition to MBVP and HD-cytarabine for PCNSL.},

We report updated results from RESONATE in these traditionally chemotherapy resistant high-risk genomic subgroups at a median follow-up of 19 months. Mutations were detected by Foundation One Heme Panel. Baseline mutations in the ibrutinib arm included TP53 (51\%), SF3B1 (31\%), NOTCH1 (28\%), ATM (19\%) and BIRC3 (14\%). Median PFS was not reached, with 74\% of patients randomized to ibrutinib alive and progression-free at 24 months. The improved efficacy of ibrutinib vs ofatumumab continues in all prognostic subgroups including del17p and del11q. No significant difference within the ibrutinib arm was observed for PFS across most genomic subtypes, although a subset carrying both TP53 mutation and del17p had reduced PFS compared with patients with neither abnormality. Reduced PFS or OS was not evident in patients with only del17p. PFS was significantly better for ibrutinib-treated patients in second-line vs later lines of therapy.

Observations The 28-year-old male patient presented to clinic with visual acuity of 20/200 in both eyes after several months of episodic bilateral vision loss. Intraretinal and pre-retinal hemorrhages were appreciated, as well as Roth spots and peripheral neovascularization. Initial lab findings were consistent with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, later, upon bone marrow examination, the diagnosis was edited to chronic myeloid leukemia. Dasatinib therapy resulted in a complete hematologic resolution after six weeks. After intravitreal injections of bevacizumab in both eyes, visual acuity improved to 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Conclusion and importance After review, this is one of only a few reported cases of bilateral blurry vision as the primary presenting symptom of chronic myeloid leukemia in a young adult. Because visual disturbances occur more frequently in acute myeloid leukemia, and lab results may be inconclusive, careful consideration should be given to differentiate myelogenous leukemias, as the acute and chronic subtypes may present similarly.},

We report final results of Part 2 evaluating the efficacy of ibrutinib plus RICE or RVICI vs RICE/RVICI alone. Patients aged 1 to 30 years (initial diagnosis {$<$}18 years) were randomized 2:1 to receive ibrutinib with or without RICE/RVICI. Primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) based on independent committee-confirmed events. Fifty-one patients were enrolled. Median age was 15 years; Burkitt lymphoma, Burkitt leukemia, and Burkitt-like lymphoma (total: 45\%) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma/primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (51\%) were the most common subtypes. At the preplanned interim analysis, median EFS was 6.1 vs 7.0 months with ibrutinib plus RICE/RVICI vs RICE/RVICI, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.9; 90\% confidence interval, 0.5-1.6; P~= .387); further enrollment was ceased. With ibrutinib plus RICE/RVICI vs RICE/RVICI, median overall survival was 14.1 vs 11.1 months, overall response rate was 69\% vs 81\%, and 46\% vs 44\% proceeded to stem cell transplantation. In both treatment arms, 100\% of patients experienced grade ‚â•3 treatment-emergent adverse events. No EFS benefit was seen with ibrutinib. Salvage was generally poor in patients who received prior rituximab, regardless of treatment arm. No new safety signals were observed. Ibrutinib exposure in pediatric patients fell within the target range of exposure in adults. Trial is registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02703272).},

  abstract = {Uniformly adopted response criteria are essential for assessment of therapies incorporating conventional chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Recently, immunomodulatory agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have demonstrated impressive activity in a broad range of lymphoma histologies. However, these agents may be associated with clinical and imaging findings during treatment suggestive of progressive disease (PD) despite evidence of clinical benefit (eg, tumor flare or pseudo-progression). Considering this finding as PD could lead to patients being prematurely removed from a treatment from which they actually stand to benefit. This phenomenon has been well described with checkpoint blockade therapy in solid tumors and anecdotally seen in lymphoma as well. To address this issue in the context of lymphoma immunomodulatory therapy, a workshop was convened to provide provisional recommendations to modify current response criteria in patients receiving these and future agents in clinical trials. The term ‚Äúindeterminate response‚Äù was introduced to identify such lesions until confirmed as flare/pseudo-progression or true PD by either biopsy or subsequent imaging.},

Unicentric CD involves a solitary enlarged lymph node and mild symptoms and excision surgery is often curative. MCD includes a form associated with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) (also known as human herpesvirus 8) and a KSHV-negative idiopathic form (iMCD). iMCD can present in association with severe syndromes such as TAFRO (thrombocytopenia, ascites, fever, reticulin fibrosis and organomegaly) or POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder and skin changes). KSHV-MCD often occurs in the setting of HIV infection or another cause of immune deficiency. The interplay between KSHV and HIV elevates the risk for the development of KSHV-induced disorders, including KSHV-MCD, KSHV-lymphoproliferation, KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome, primary effusion lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma. A CD diagnosis requires a multidimensional approach, including clinical presentation and imaging, pathological features, and molecular virology. B cell-directed monoclonal antibody therapy is the standard of care in KSHV-MCD, and anti-IL-6 therapy is the recommended first-line therapy and only treatment of iMCD approved by the US FDA and EMA.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only potentially curative option for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) but is severely limited by nonrelapse mortality (NRM), especially in this mostly older population. Comorbidity assessment is crucial to predict NRM and often assessed with the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI). Moreover, the impact of age on NRM still remains a matter of debate. In recent years, the age at which transplants are made has been progressively increasing, and patients with comorbidities have become more common. Extricating the respective roles of age and comorbidities in toxic mortality is all the more important. This study by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry included 1245 adult patients who underwent a first allogeneic stem cell transplantation for MDSs between 2003 and 2014. Overall, 4-year NRM and overall survival were 32\% and 47\%, respectively. When considered as continuous predictors, HCT-CI score and age were associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) for NRM. In multivariate analysis, age band (HR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.25; P= .016), HCT-CI ‚â•3 (HR, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.04 to 1.73; P\,=\,.022), and Karnofsky Performance Status ‚â§80 (HR, 2.03; 95\% CI, 1.52 to 2.73; P},

We randomly divided 60 patients with low-grade anemic MDS and serum EPO levels lower than 500 IU/L (500 mU/mL) into 2 groups: rHuEPO + rHuG-CSF (arm A) and supportive care (arm B). After 12 weeks, those who had erythroid responses were given rHuEPO alone for 40 additional weeks. They were also given rHuG-CSF if they had relapses. A response was considered major if the hemoglobin (Hb) level was 115 g/L (11.5 g/dL) or higher and minor Hb increase was 15 g/L (1.5 g/dL) or more or if it remained stable without transfusion. Ten of 24 patients responded in arm A, and 0 of 26 responded in arm B (P =.01). Eight patients in arm A continued rHuEPO therapy alone, and 6 had relapses. Responses were always restored when rHuG-CSF was reintroduced. Mean direct costs per patient were 26,723 euros (arm A) and 8,746 euros (arm B). Quality of life was assessed with a Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) scale. Similar percentages of patients from both arms showed significant clinical improvement. rHuEPO plus rHuG-CSF led to responses in 41.7\% of MDS patients. This treatment was expensive. No effect on quality of life was demonstrated.},

The primary objective was the major molecular response (MMolR) rate after cycle 2, patients being then eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) if they had a donor, or autologous SCT if in MMolR and no donor. With fewer induction deaths, the complete remission (CR) rate was higher in arm A than in arm B (98\% vs 91\%; P = .006), whereas the MMolR rate was similar in both arms (66\% vs 64\%). With a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 5-year event-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated at 37.1\% and 45.6\%, respectively, without difference between the arms. Allogeneic transplantation was associated with a significant benefit in relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; P = .036) and OS (HR, 0.64; P = .02), with initial white blood cell count being the only factor significantly interacting with this SCT effect. In patients achieving MMolR, outcome was similar after autologous and allogeneic transplantation. This study validates an induction regimen combining reduced-intensity chemotherapy and imatinib in Ph+ ALL adult patients and suggests that SCT in first CR is still a good option for Ph+ ALL adult patients.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with newly diagnosed high-risk Burkitt lymphoma are treated with high-intensity immune-chemotherapy regimens such as R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC or with lower-intensity regimens such as DA-EPOCH-R. The aim of this study was to make a formal comparison between these regimens. METHODS: This multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised study was done in 26 clinical centres in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk Burkitt lymphoma without CNS involvement. Patients were randomly assigned to two cycles of R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC (R-CODOX-M: rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1 and 9, cyclophosphamide 800 mg/m2 on day 1, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 on days 2-5, vincristine 1¬∑5 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 on day 1, and methotrexate 3000 mg/m2 on day 10; R-IVAC: rituximab 375 mg/m2 on days 3 and 7, iphosphamide 1500 mg/m2 on days 1-5, etoposide 60 mg/m2 on days 1-5, and cytarabin 2000 mg/m2 on day 1 and 2) or six cycles of DA-EPOCH-R (dose-adjusted etoposide 50-124 mg/m2 on days 1-4, prednisolone 120 mg/m2 on days 1-5, vincristine 0¬∑4 mg/m2 on days 1-4, dose-adjusted cyclophosphamide 480-1866 mg/m2 on day 5, dose-adjusted doxorubicin 10-24¬∑8 mg/m2 on days 1-4, rituximab 375 mg/m2 on days 1 and 5). Patients older than 65 years received a dose modified R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC. All drugs were intravenous except for prednisolone, which was oral. Patients also received four intrathecal CNS administrations with cytarabin (70 mg) and four with methotrexate (15 mg). Patients were stratified by centre, leukemic disease, and HIV-positivity. The primary endpoint was progression-fee survival. All analyses were done by modified intention-to-treat, excluding randomly assigned patients who were subsequently found to have CNS involvement or diagnosis other than Burkitt lymphoma at study entry. This study is registered with the European Clinical Trial Register, EudraCT2013-004394-27. FINDINGS: Due to a slow accrual, the study was closed prematurely on Nov 15, 2021. Between Aug 4, 2014, and Sept 17, 2021, 89 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC (n=46) or DA-EPOCH-R (n=43). Five patients were excluded after random assignment (three in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group [one diagnosis other than Burkitt lymphoma at study entry according to local pathology and two CNS involvement] and two in the DA-EPOCH-R group [one diagnosis other than Burkitt lymphoma at study entry according to local pathology and one CNS involvement]. 84 remaining patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. 73 (87\%) of 84 patients were male, 76 (90\%) presented with stage III or IV disease, and nine (11\%) had HIV-positive Burkitt lymphoma. Median patient age was 52 years (IQR 37-64). With a median follow-up of 28¬∑5 months (IQR 13¬∑2-43¬∑7), 2-year progression-free survival was 76\% (95\% CI 60-86\%) in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group and 70\% (54-82\%) in the DA-EPOCH-R group (hazard ratio 1¬∑42, 95\% CI 0¬∑63-3¬∑18; p=0¬∑40). There were two deaths in the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group (one infection [treatment related] and one due to disease progression [not treatment related]) and one death in the DA-EPOCH-R group (COVID-19 infection [treatment related]). In the R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC group, four patients went off-protocol because of toxic effects, versus none in the DA-EPOCH-R group. Patients treated with R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC had more infectious adverse events (24 [56\%] of 43 patients had at least one grade 3-5 infection vs 14 [34\%] of 41 patients in the DA-EPOCH-R group). INTERPRETATION: The trial stopped early, but the available data suggest that while DA-EPOCH-R did not result in superior progression-free survival compared with R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC, it was associated with fewer toxic effects and need for supportive care. DA-EPOCH-R appears to be an additional valid therapeutic option for patients with high-risk Burkitt lymphoma without CNS involvement.

  abstract = {The year 2017 was marked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first two chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapies. The approved indications were for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in a second or later relapse. Since then, extensive research activities have been ongoing globally on different hematologic and solid tumors to assess the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy for these diseases. Limitations to CAR-T therapy became apparent from, e.g., the relapse in up to 60\% of patients and certain side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This led to extensive clinical activities aimed at overcoming these obstacles, so that the use of CAR-T therapy can be expanded. Attempts to improve on efficacy and safety include changing the CAR-T administration schedule, combining it with chemotherapy, and the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies, e.g., through the use of CAR-natural killer (CAR-NK) and CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms). This review will focus on new CAR-T treatment strategies in hematologic malignancies, clinical trials aimed at improving efficacy and addressing side effects, the challenges that CAR-T therapy faces in solid tumors, and the ongoing research aimed at overcoming these challenges.},

  abstract = {Childhood immune thrombocytopenia (ITP; platelet count {$<$} 100 √ó 109/L) is the most common bleeding disorder in children. A total of 3-5\% of children with ITP face a greater risk of bleeding, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Childhood ITP is often benign and self-limited; however, children with severe ITP (platelet count {$<$} 30 √ó 109/L) require investigation and monitoring. In addition, 20\% of ITP patients may not go into remission (platelet counts {$<$} 100 √ó 109/L by 12 months after diagnosis) and may develop chronic ITP. The early identifying predictors associated with the resolution of severe ITP at the time of diagnosis may be helpful for family guidance. However, there is still controversy about the associations between the clinical factors at the time of initial diagnosis and the definitions of disease remission assessed at different timepoints after diagnosis. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the shared clinical factors among the disease remission definitions at three arbitrarily set timepoints-3, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis. This study retrieved records for hospitalized children aged under 18 years and diagnosed with ITP from the hospital registry in a tertiary university hospital. Clinical variables were recorded by reviewing the medical records with structured data entry for ITP admission. The serial follow-up platelet counts within 12 months after diagnosis were recorded. The times of ITP remission were identified by experienced pediatric hematologists. Patients with mild-form ITP (platelet counts ‚â• 30 √ó 109/L) at diagnosis or who were lost to follow-up within 3 months were excluded. From 1988 to 2019, 546 children were enrolled, and a total of 497 children with severe ITP were included in the further analysis. In total, one (0.2\%) died of an intracranial hemorrhage, 363 (73.2\%) children went into remission at 3 months, 40 (8.1\%) went into remission between 6 and 12 months, and 104 (20.9\%) developed chronic ITP. The shared significant predictors for remission by the third, sixth, and twelfth months included pre-adolescent age ({$<$}10 years) at diagnosis, abrupt onset (duration of symptoms prior to admission ‚â§ 2 weeks), and speedy recovery (platelet count {$>$} 100 √ó 109/L at 1 month post diagnosis). ITP patients with positive viral serology tests or vaccination within 4 weeks had trends of delayed remission. In conclusion, diagnosis before preadolescent age, abrupt onset, and speedy recovery may share favorable factors for the remission of childhood ITP assessed at different timepoints.},

This heterogeneity is a challenge for evaluating response to treatment. Therapeutic trials in MDS have used various criteria to assess results, making cross-study comparisons problematic. In 2000, an International Working Group (IWG) proposed standardized response criteria for evaluating clinically significant responses in MDS. These criteria included measures of alteration in the natural history of disease, hematologic improvement, cytogenetic response, and improvement in health-related quality of life. The relevance of the response criteria has now been validated prospectively in MDS clinical trials, and they have gained acceptance in research studies and in clinical practice. Because limitations of the IWG criteria have surfaced, based on practical and reported experience, some modifications were warranted. In this report, we present recommendations for revisions of some of the initial criteria.}

In 1988, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group published the first widely accepted criteria for CLL,1 which were revised in 1996.2 Such recommendations were developed in the context of currently available cytotoxic therapies. Later, in 2008, the International Workshop on CLL published criteria that incorporated much of the 1996 guidelines but also included guidance on how to assess minimal residual disease after therapy.3 These published guidelines defined therapy outcome as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), based on surrogate markers of tumor burden, such as blood lymphocyte count, lymph node size, or spleen size, and indicators of improved marrow function or clearance of leukemia cells from the marrow, as assessed by serial blood counts and/or marrow aspirate and biopsy. In general, these response criteria (CR, PR, SD, and PD) in therapeutic trials have correlated with the length of progression-free survival (PFS) and occasionally overall survival after treatment. Because assessment of response using these criteria can often be made years before survival data are available, response criteria have served as useful surrogate markers for assessing the clinical benefit of therapy, thereby accelerating the pace of approval of novel agents for use in the treatment of patients.},

Sixty patients (median age 41.9 years) were enrolled: 33 were p190+, 18 p210+ and 9 p190/p210+. At the end of induction (day +85), 58 patients (97\%) achieved a complete hematologic remission. No deaths in induction were recorded. Eleven patients (18.3\%) obtained a complete molecular response. Among non-complete molecular responders (n=47), 22 underwent an allogeneic transplant. Seventeen hematologic relapses occurred (median 7 months, range 3-40.1), 13 during consolidation and 4 post-transplant. ABL1 mutations (5 T315I, 3 V299L, 1 E281K and 1 G254E) were found in 10/13 relapsed cases. With a median follow-up of 57.4 months (range: 4.2-75.6), overall survival and disease-free survival are 56.3\% and 47.2\%. A better diseasefree survival was observed in patients who obtained a molecular response at day +85 compared to cases who did not. The presence of additional copy number aberrations - IKZF1 plus CDKN2A/B and/or PAX5 deletions - was the most important unfavorable prognostic factor on overall and disease-free survival (p=0.005 and p=0.0008). This study shows that in adult Ph+ ALL long-term survivals can be achieved with a total-therapy strategy based on a chemo-free induction and, in complete molecular responders, also without further systemic chemotherapy. Finally, the screening of additional copy number aberrations should be included in the diagnostic work-up. EudraCT 2010-019119-39.},

  abstract = {The landscape of relapsed or refractory (R/R) Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treatment has changed significantly since the FDA approval of brentuximab vedotin in 2011. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the therapy for R/R classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Immunotherapies with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have shown promising results in early phase trials. Other novel agents under investigation include targeted therapies with histone deacetylase inhibitors, Janus kinase 2 inhibitors, and immunomodulators. While further studies with larger populations and longer follow-up times are needed to determine the safe and effective combinations, these novel approaches represent a growing list of treatment options that are on the horizon to improve the cure rate and increase duration of remission for R/R HL patients.},

This results in the expression of a chimeric bcr-abl message that encodes the P210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase. The cells of 10\% of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients (ALL) carry a cytogenetically similar Ph1 translocation. We report that Ph1-positive ALL cells express unique abl-derived tyrosine kinases of 185 and 180 kilodaltons that are distinct from the bcr-abl-derived P210 protein of CML. The appearance of the 185/180-kilodalton proteins correlates with the expression of a novel 6.5-kilobase messenger RNA. Thus, similar genetic translocations in two different leukemias result in the expression of distinct c-abl-derived products.},

In recent decades, Italian epidemiological data has shown worrisome rates of FQ resistance. A single-center cohort study on 136 autologous stem cell transplantations (ASCTs) and 223 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (allo-HSCTs) was performed from January 2018 to December 2020. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the first-line therapy for febrile neutropenia (FN). Since February 2019, FQ-P has been omitted. We evaluated the day~+30 posttransplant cumulative incidence function (CIF) of gram-negative bacteria pre-engraftment bloodstream infections (PE-BSIs) and any changes in antimicrobial resistance, FN, and infection-related mortality (IRM). In ASCTs, ‚â•1 FN episode occurred in 74.3\% of transplants, without differences among groups (P = .66). CIF of gram-negative bacteria PE-BSI was 10.1\%, with a significant difference according to FQ-P (0\% [LEVO-group] vs 14.1\% [NO-LEVO-group], P = .016). CIF of IRM was 0\% in both groups. In allo-HSCTs, ‚â•1 FN episode occurred in 96.4\% of transplants, without differences among groups (P = .72). CIF of gram-negative bacteria PE-BSI was 28\%, significantly higher without FQ-P (14.7\% [LEVO-group] vs 34.4\% [NO-LEVO-group], P = .003). CIF of IRM was 5\%, superimposable in both groups (P = .62). Comparing antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacteria of allo-HSCT setting, in the group without FQ-P, a significantly higher proportion of pathogens was susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (71\% vs 30\%, P = .026), FQ (49\% vs 10\%, P = .03), and carbapenems (95\% vs 50\%, P = .001). FQ-P discontinuation increased gram-negative bacteria PE-BSI but did not impact IRM, both in the ASCT and allo-HSCT settings; importantly, it concurred to significantly decrease antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria.},

Chemoimmunotherapy with intrathecal (IT) CNS prophylaxis and contralateral testis irradiation eliminates contralateral recurrences and reduces CNS relapses. The IELSG30 phase 2 study investigated feasibility and activity of an intensified IT and IV CNS prophylaxis. Patients with stage I/II PTL who had not received treatment received 2 cycles of IV high-dose methotrexate (MTX) (1.5 g/m2) after 6 cycles of the R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, every 21~days). IT liposomal cytarabine was administered on day 0 of cycles 2 to 5 of 21-day R-CHOP regimen. Contralateral testis radiotherapy (25-30 Gy) was recommended. Fifty-four patients (median age: 66 years) with stage I (n~= 32) or II (n~= 22) disease were treated with R-CHOP, 53 received at least 3 doses of IT cytarabine, 48 received at least 1 dose of IV MTX, and 50 received prophylactic radiotherapy. No unexpected toxicity occurred. At a median follow-up of 6 years, there was no CNS relapse; 7 patients progressed, and 8 died, with 5-year progression-free and overall survival rates of 91\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 79-96) and 92\% (95\%~CI, 81-97), respectively. Extranodal recurrence was documented in 6 patients (in 2 without nodal involvement). In 4 cases, the relapse occurred {$>$}6 years after treatment. Causes of death were lymphoma (n~= 4), second primary malignancy (n~= 1), cerebral vasculopathy (n~= 1), unknown (n~= 2). Intensive prophylaxis was feasible and effective in preventing CNS relapses.

  abstract = {Relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) challenges clinicians to devise treatment strategies that are effective and safe. This problem is particularly prominent in an era when de-escalation trials are designed to minimize therapeutic toxicities in both early- and advanced-stage disease. Radiation therapy is the single most effective treatment modality for HL, and its integration into salvage regimens, or its independent use in select patients, must be understood to maximize our success in treating these patients. The complexity of treating relapsed or refractory HL derives from the spectrum of primary treatment approaches currently in use that creates heterogeneity in both treatment exposure and the potential toxicities of salvage therapy. Patients can have relapsed or refractory disease after limited or aggressive primary therapy (with or without radiation therapy), at early or delayed time points, with limited or extensive disease volumes, and with varying degrees of residual morbidity from primary therapy.Their response to salvage systemic therapy can be partial or complete, and the use of consolidative stem cell transplantation is variably applied. New biologics and immunotherapeutic approaches have broadened but also complicated salvage treatment approaches. Through all of this, radiation therapy remains an integral component of treatment for many patients, but it must be used effectively and judiciously. The purpose of this review is to describe the different treatment scenarios and provide guidance for radiation dose, volume, and timing in patients with relapsed or refractory HL.},

  abstract = {Background: The cumulative red blood cells (RBC) transfusion burden is known to impact outcomes in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but doesn't accurately predict prognosis during the early disease phase. Here we aimed to assess the prognostic value of early changes in transfusion patterns in addition to the recent IPSS-M scoring system. Methods: We gathered diagnostic biobank samples from adult patients (pts) with MDS and registered in the Karolinska Institute's biobank (KI) and the National Swedish MDS Biobank (NB) between 2003-2017 and 2013-2017, respectively. DNA targeted sequencing (152 genes) was performed (Bernard et al., NEJM Evid, 2022). Clinical data was retrieved through pts‚Äô charts (KI) and the Swedish cancer registry (NB). Pts were treated according to Nordic/EU guidelines and most common therapies for lower-risk MDS and higher-risk MDS were erythropoietin and azacytidine, respectively. Transfusion data was obtained from the SCANDAT registry. Pts were followed with regards to RBC transfusion until censored due to death, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML-t), allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), or end of follow-up on the 31st of August 2018, whichever occurred first. As per the IWG hematological response criteria for MDS (Platzbecker et al., Blood 2019), transfusion states (TS) were categorized every 4 months (m) as transfusion dependent (TD) or transfusion free (TF) during the past 4 m period. Lower-risk MDS (LR) was defined as IPSS-M very low, low and moderate low, and higher-risk MDS (HR) as IPSS-M very high, high and moderate high at diagnosis (Bernard et al., NEJM Evid, 2022). Landmark analyses of overall survival (OS) were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method for estimating probabilities of OS over time. Multivariable analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards model. Results: We gathered a cohort of 688 pts with MDS from KI (n=424) and 33 other clinics in Sweden (NB, n=264). Median age at diagnosis was 74 years (y) old (range 19-93). The male:female ratio in the cohort was 1.4. At diagnosis, 63\% of the pts were TF. Out of 646 pts evaluable by the IPSS-M score at diagnosis 54\% had LR. Most frequently mutated genes in the cohort were TET2, SF3B1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, RUNX1, TET2, TP53 (66\% TP53 multihit), U2AF1, STAG2, ZRSR2. Changes between TS (transitions) preferentially occurred within a year after diagnosis (panel A) with a median time for occurrence of transfusion-related transitions of 1.0 y (range 0.33-8.37). Based on this finding, we assessed whether TS at 8 m landmark impacted prognosis. We observed that there was a significant difference in OS since landmark between TF pts compared with TD pts at landmark 8 m and across IPSS-M categories (panel B). LR pts who were TD at 8 m, had a median OS of 3.2 y (95\% CI: 2.2-4.0) versus 6.9 y (95\% CI: 5.6-8.9) for LR pts who were TF (P{$<$}0.0001). Similarly, median OS was 0.8 y (95\% CI: 0.6-1.1) in HR and TD pts while it was 2.4 y (95\% CI: 2.1-3.1) in HR and TF pts at landmark 8 m (P{$<$}0.0001). Interestingly, OS for LR pts who were TD didn't significantly differ from HR pts who were TF at 8 m. Overall, pts TD at 8 m had more gene mutations compared to TF pts (median 5 [1;13] and 4 [1;16], respectively, P=0.0084). Moreover, studying specific genetic subgroups of MDS, TS at 8 m distinguished subsets of pts with adverse or favorable outcomes within SF3B1-mutated LR pts. In this population, the median OS in pts TF at 8 m was 8.4 y (95\% CI: 6.5-13.1) compared to 3.2 y (95\% CI: 1.7-4.1) for TD pts (P{$<$}0.0001). Next, in multivariable analysis, we found that TD at 8 m significantly impacted OS (HR=2.4 [95\% CI: 1.9-3.1]), independently of diagnostic IPSS-M score, age, gender and type of MDS (de novo or therapy-related). Conclusion: TS at landmark 8 m, usually after outcome of first-line treatment was evaluated, appears to be a strong and independent predictor of OS in MDS. These findings are of particular importance for the LR group in which it could discriminate subsets with favorable outcomes from those with adverse prognosis. In addition to the IPSS-M calculation at diagnosis, transfusion dependency could be easily used for prognostic reassessment during follow-up. More generally, these results highlight the need of dynamic outcomes prediction tools and/or validation of current prognostic scores in dynamic settings. Finally, multistate modeling of the dataset is being completed and aims to assess how changes of transfusion patterns over time impact prognosis.

These drugs have demonstrated remarkable single-agent activity in patients with heavily pretreated disease, and 3 drugs have so far received regulatory approvals in various countries. However, BsAbs can potentially lead to severe toxicity associated with T-cell activation, particularly cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The anticipated widespread use of these off-the-shelf products poses challenges for implementation and highlights the need for guidance in anticipating, mitigating, and managing adverse events. In clinical trials, guidance for the evaluation and treatment of CRS and neurotoxicity associated with BsAb therapy has been modeled after algorithms originally created for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies and other immune effector therapies, yet notable differences in timing, quality, and severity exist between the toxicities of BsAbs and CAR T-cell therapies. We therefore convened an international panel of academic and community practice physicians, advanced practitioners, registered nurses, and pharmacists with experience using CD3√óCD20 BsAbs in clinical trial and off-trial settings to provide comprehensive, consensus-based recommendations specific to the assessment and management of CD3√óCD20 BsAb‚Äìrelated toxicities.},

SCHOLAR-1, an international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research study, retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with refractory DLBCL which, for this study, was defined as progressive disease or stable disease as best response at any point during chemotherapy ({$>$}4 cycles of first-line or 2 cycles of later-line therapy) or relapsed at ÔøΩÔøΩ12 months from autologous stem cell transplantation. SCHOLAR-1 pooled data from 2 phase 3 clinical trials (Lymphoma Academic Research Organization-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center and University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence). Response rates and overall survival were estimated from the time of initiation of salvage therapy for refractory disease. Among 861 patients, 636 were included on the basis of refractory disease inclusion criteria. For patients with refractory DLBCL, the objective response rate was 26\% (complete response rate, 7\%) to the next line of therapy, and the median overall survival was 6.3 months. Twenty percent of patients were alive at 2 years. Outcomes were consistently poor across patient subgroups and study cohorts. SCHOLAR-1 is the largest patient-level pooled retrospective analysis to characterize response rates and survival for a population of patients with refractory DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This article summarizes our approach to the management of children and adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who do not respond to, cannot tolerate, or are unwilling to undergo splenectomy. We begin with a critical reassessment of the diagnosis and a deliberate attempt to exclude nonautoimmune causes of thrombocytopenia and secondary ITP. For patients in whom the diagnosis is affirmed, we consider observation without treatment. Observation is appropriate for most asymptomatic patients with a platelet count of 20 to 30 √ó 109/L or higher. We use a tiered approach to treat patients who require therapy to increase the platelet count. Tier 1 options (rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, low-dose corticosteroids) have a relatively favorable therapeutic index. We exhaust all Tier 1 options before proceeding to Tier 2, which comprises a host of immunosuppressive agents with relatively lower response rates and/or greater toxicity. We often prescribe Tier 2 drugs not alone but in combination with a Tier 1 or a second Tier 2 drug with a different mechanism of action. We reserve Tier 3 strategies, which are of uncertain benefit and/or high toxicity with little supporting evidence, for the rare patient with serious bleeding who does not respond to Tier 1 and Tier 2 therapies.},

  abstract = {Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can cure myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), although transplantation carries significant risks of morbidity and mortality. Because the optimal timing of HLA-matched BMT for MDS is unknown, we constructed a Markov model to examine 3 transplantation strategies for newly diagnosed MDS: transplantation at diagnosis, transplantation at leukemic progression, and transplantation at an interval from diagnosis but prior to leukemic progression. Analyses using individual patient risk-assessment data from transplantation and nontransplantation registries were performed for all 4 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups with adjustments for quality of life (QoL). For low and intermediate-1 IPSS groups, delayed transplantation maximized overall survival. Transplantation prior to leukemic transformation was associated with a greater number of life years than transplantation at the time of leukemic progression. In a cohort of patients under the age of 40 years, an even more marked survival advantage for delayed transplantation was noted. For intermediate-2 and high IPSS groups, transplantation at diagnosis maximized overall survival. No changes in the optimal transplantation strategies were noted when QoL adjustments were incorporated. For low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS, delayed BMT is associated with maximal life expectancy, whereas immediate transplantation for intermediate-2- and high-risk disease is associated with maximal life expectancy.}

Here, we present the 13-year follow up of our study. Fifty-four patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled: 39 (72\%) with de novo disease, 6 (11\%) whose disease was primary refractory after induction (without a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and 9 (17\%) in complete remission after one course of induction therapy (without tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Forty-two (93\%) of the 45 patients treated for active disease achieved complete remission, one achieved complete remission with incomplete recovery of platelets, one achieved partial remission and one died during induction. Nineteen (35\%) patients are alive and 18 are in complete remission. The 5-year overall survival rate for all patients was 43\%. Significant negative predictors of overall survival were age over 60 years, p190 molecular transcript, and active disease at enrollment. Sixteen (30\%) patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Median overall survival was not significantly greater for patients who underwent transplant. Patients with residual molecular disease at three months had improved complete remission duration with transplant. The median time to hematologic recovery and severe toxicities with combination were not significantly different from those observed with conventional chemotherapy. Only one patient discontinued therapy due to toxicity. HyperCVAD chemotherapy and imatinib is an effective regimen for Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Transplant may not be indicated in all patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00038610).},

Disease risks scored according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) and presence of comorbidity graded according to the HCT Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) were recognized as relevant clinical variables for HSCT eligibility. Fit patients with higher-risk IPSS-R and those with lower-risk IPSS-R with poor-risk genetic features, profound cytopenias, and high transfusion burden are candidates for HSCT. Patients with a very high MDS transplantation risk score, based on combination of advanced age, high HCT-CI, very poor-risk cytogenetic and molecular features, and high IPSS-R score have a low chance of cure with standard HSCT and consideration should be given to treating these patients in investigational studies. Cytoreductive therapy prior to HSCT is advised for patients with ‚â•10\% bone marrow myeloblasts. Evidence from prospective randomized clinical trials does not provide support for specific recommendations on the optimal high intensity conditioning regimen. For patients with contraindications to high-intensity preparative regimens, reduced intensity conditioning should be considered. Optimal timing of HSCT requires careful evaluation of the available effective nontransplant strategies. Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) strategies are recommended in patients at high risk of relapse after HSCT. Immune modulation by DLI strategies or second HSCT is advised if relapse occurs beyond 6 months after HSCT.}

The European MDS Registry collects prospective data at 6-monthly intervals from newly diagnosed lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes patients in 16 European countries and Israel. Data on the transfusion dose density - the cumulative dose received at the end of each interval divided by the time since the beginning of the interval in which the first transfusion was received - were analyzed using proportional hazards regression with time-varying co-variates, with death and progression to higher-risk MDS/acute myeloid leukemia as events. Of the 1,267 patients included in the analyses, 317 died without progression; in 162 patients the disease had progressed. PFS was significantly associated with age, EQ-5D index, baseline World Health Organization classification, bone marrow blast count, cytogenetic risk category, number of cytopenias, and country. Transfusion dose density was inversely associated with PFS (P{$<$}1√ó10-4): dose density had an increasing effect on hazard until a dose density of 3 units/16 weeks. The transfusion dose density effect continued to increase beyond 8 units/16 weeks after correction for the impact of treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, lenalidomide and/or iron chelators. In conclusion, the negative effect of transfusion treatment on PFS already occurs at transfusion densities below 3 units/16 weeks. This indicates that transfusion dependency, even at relatively low dose densities, may be considered as an indicator of inferior PFS. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT00600860.}

Remission-induction therapy consisted of 1 or 2 courses with idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide, followed by one intensive consolidation course with cytarabine and mitoxantrone. Initially, bone marrow cells were used for ASCT. Subsequently, mobilized blood stem cells were used in an attempt to shorten posttransplantation hypoplasia. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years the 184 evaluable patients showed a 4-year survival rate of 26\% and a median survival of 13 months. The remission-induction chemotherapy induced complete remission (CR) in 100 patients (54\%). The 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 29\% and the median DFS was 12 months. Twenty-eight of 39 patients (72\%) with a donor were allografted in CR-1, including 2 patients who underwent transplantation in CR-1 without a consolidation course. Thirty-six of 59 patients (61\%) without a donor received ASCT in CR-1. The 4-year DFS rates in the group of patients with or without a donor were 31\% and 27\%, respectively. The 4-year survival rates from CR were 36\% and 33\%, respectively. This large prospective study shows the feasibility of both alloSCT and ASCT. This treatment approach leads to a relatively high remission rate, and the majority of patients in remission received the SCT in CR-1. The ongoing study investigates whether this approach is better than treatment with chemotherapy only.}

  abstract = {The sole curative therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Here this therapeutic modality is reviewed and critically evaluated in the context of the evidence. Specific criteria were used for searching the published literature and for grading the quality and strength of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. A panel of MDS experts comprising transplantation and nontransplantation physicians developed consensus treatment recommendations. This review summarizes the standard MDS indications for HCT and addresses areas of controversy. Recent prospective trials have confirmed that allogeneic HCT confers survival benefits in patients with advanced or high-risk MDS compared with nontransplantation approaches, and the use of HCT is increasing in older patients with good performance status. However, patients with high-risk cytogenetic or molecular mutations remain at high risk for relapse. It is unknown whether administration of novel therapies before or after transplantation may decrease the risk of disease relapse in selected populations. Ongoing and future studies will investigate revised approaches to disease risk stratification, patient selection, and post-transplantation approaches to optimize allogeneic HCT outcomes for patients with MDS.}

  abstract = {Abstract   Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable malignancy involving lymph nodes and the lymphatic system. Even at late stage disease, about 70\% of patients will be cured with standard first line therapy. For patients who experience relapse or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the standard treatment option is high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplant. However about 50\% of patients will have recurrence after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation and have worse prognosis with median overall survival of 32\% at 5 years. The anti-PD1 checkpoints inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab have remarkably improved outcomes of patients with relapse of refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation. On the other hand, radiotherapy is an entire component of salvage therapy and its efficacy is now well established in term of local disease control in sites of relapsed or refractory Hodkin lymphoma. Defining the optimal modality and timing of radiotherapy as these new agents arrive is a challenge. An interesting approach is the combination of radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor and the possibility of stopping the treatment when complete response is achieved. We add to the literature two new cases of combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy in patients who relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation and consolidation with brentuximab vedotin, resulting in excellent outcomes.},

Multiple mechanisms of CAR-T therapy failure have been proposed but management of these patients remains a challenge.

Recent advances in novel immunotherapies such as bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and next-generation CAR-T therapies may provide avenues for treatment.

  abstract = {von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by its heterogeneous clinical manifestation, which complicates its diagnosis and management. The clinical management of VWD has remained essentially unchanged over the last 30 years or so, using von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentrates, desmopressin, and anti‚Äìfibrinolytic agents as main tools to control bleeding. This is in contrast to hemophilia A, for which a continuous innovative path has led to novel treatment modalities. Despite current VWD management being considered effective, quality-of-life studies consistently reveal a higher than anticipated burden of VWD on patients, which is particularly true for women. Apparently, despite our perceived notion of current therapeutic efficiency, there is space for innovation with the goal of reaching superior efficacy. Developing innovative treatments for VWD is complex, especially given the heterogeneity of the disease and the multifunctional nature of VWF. In this perspective article, we describe several potential strategies that could provide the basis for future VWD treatments. These include genetic approaches, such as gene therapy using dual-vector adenoassociated virus and transcriptional silencing of mutant alleles. Furthermore, protein-based approaches to increase factor FVIII levels in VWD-type 3 or 2N patients are discussed. Finally, antibody-based options to interfere with VWF degradation (for congenital VWD-type 2A or acquired von Willebrand syndrome-type 2A) or increase endogenous VWF levels (for VWD-type 1) are presented. By highlighting these potential strategies, we hope to initiate an innovative path, which ultimately would allow us to better serve VWD patients and their specific needs.},

The primary end point was the proportion of patients platelet transfusion-free during cycles 1 through 4 of azacitidine therapy. Based on planned interim analyses, an independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping the study prematurely because efficacy outcomes crossed the predefined futility threshold and for safety reasons. At termination, 28/179 (16\%) eltrombopag and 55/177 (31\%) placebo patients met the primary end point. Overall response (International Working Group criteria; complete, marrow, or partial response) occurred in 20\% and 35\% of eltrombopag and placebo patients, respectively, by investigator assessment. There was no difference in hematologic improvement in any cell lineage between the 2 arms. There was no improvement in overall or progression-free survival. Adverse events with ‚â•10\% occurrence in the eltrombopag vs placebo arm were febrile neutropenia and diarrhea.

The diagnosis is based on having both the polyradiculoneuropathy and the monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and at least 1 of the other 3 major criteria (Castleman disease, sclerotic bone lesions, or elevated VEGF) and at least one minor criterion. The diagnosis is often delayed with intervening incorrect diagnoses of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, myeloproliferative disorder, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Prompt treatment directed at the underlying plasma cell clone produces dramatic responses in the majority of patients. Although there are no randomized clinical trial data to direct best therapy, for patients with disseminated disease, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood transplantation has yielded durable benefit, whereas radiation therapy is typically effective for patients with a more localized presentation.

This review contemplates different treatment strategies for patients with cHL that relapse or progress after auto-HCT. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has, for many years, been the only curative option for this group of patients. Although the advent of haploidentical donors has allowed for the possibility to allograft almost all patients that are in need of it and to eventually improve historical results, allo-HCT is still associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an antibody drug conjugate that binds to CD30 antigen; BV is able to give up to 34\% metabolic complete remissions (mCR) in HL patients that fail auto-HCT. Unleashing the immune system with PD-1 inhibitors has resulted in remarkable responses in a number of malignancies, including HL. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab offer a 20\%‚Äì25\% mCR and 40\%‚Äì50\% partial remissions, with an acceptable safety profile. R/R cHL do have several options nowadays that, without any doubt, have significantly improved the long-term outcome of this hard-to-treat population.},

  abstract = {Liver failure with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening syndrome with high mortality. The aim of this study was to decipher clinical and laboratory characteristics of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after definite diagnosis of liver failure and to provide clues for early diagnosis and treatment of HLH in patients with liver failure. Eleven patients diagnosed with liver failure and HLH were retrospectively investigated in this study. All patients presented with jaundice, persistent high-grade fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, evidence of hemophagocytes in the bone marrow and laboratory abnormalities indicating HLH. The average interval from the earliest diagnosis of liver failure to a definitive diagnosis of HLH was 17.27 days. Six (54.55\%) patients died during follow-up. For patients with liver failure after admission and subsequently definitively diagnosed with HLH, bilirubin and INR were significantly decreased. HLH is definitely diagnosed at an intermediate or late stage when patients have already suffered from liver failure. The initial dose of glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone) was decreased to 1‚Äì1.5\,mg/kg/d and gradually reduced thereafter. In conclusion, for patients with liver failure, HLH should be screened as early as possible upon persistent fever, splenomegaly and unexplained pancytopenia. For patients with liver failure and HLH, the dosage of glucocorticoid should be reduced to avoid serious side effects.},

  abstract = {: Background: At our institution, RNs have performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy procedures for more than 10 years. A recent review of our institutional policies and practices regarding RN-performed bone marrow procedures was intended to ensure that we were using a safe and evidence-based approach and prompted this program evaluation. METHODS: We conducted a literature search and review of our institutional policies and practices regarding RN-performed bone marrow procedures. All elements of our clinical practice were reviewed and evaluated, including outcomes. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2017, the RN team completed a total of 10,867 bone marrow procedures in our hospital-based ambulatory infusion center. The team included 15 nurses who completed up to eight patient procedures each weekday. Patient satisfaction rates were consistently high and complication rates were very low: less than 1\% of all patients experienced postprocedure bleeding, and less than 2\% required urgent medical care within 24 hours of the procedure. In an analysis of bone marrow procedures performed between 2016 and 2017, the quality of bone marrow samples obtained by the RN team remained high, consistently meeting or exceeding our 95\% clinical adequacy goal. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence in the literature supporting the practice of RN-performed bone marrow procedures. Our review revealed a robust program with excellent clinical and diagnostic outcomes that can be emulated by other institutions interested in pursuing RN-performed bone marrow procedures.},

Because of the favorable outcome data reported for CART cells, uncertainty is emerging if there is still a role for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in the treatment of R/R DLBCL. This article provides an overview of available evidence and theoretical considerations to put these 2 types of cellular immunotherapy (CI) into perspective. Altogether, current data suggest that CART cells are preferred now over transplantation as first-choice CI in many clinical situations. However, the majority of patients will fail CART therapy, resulting in an unmet medical need where allo-HCT could be beneficial. In contrast, employing allo-HCT instead of CART cells as first CI should be presently restricted to situations where CART cell therapy is deemed not feasible or useful, such as patients with refractory cytopenia or incipient myelodysplastic syndrome. However, allo-HCT remains a standard treatment option as first CI for patients with chemosensitive R/R DLBCL when CARTs are not available or transplantation is preferred by the patient. Continuous collection and analysis of CI outcome data by professional registries appear to be of key importance for developing rational strategies of CI allocation and sequencing.},

  abstract = {Abstract Approximately 10\% to 30\% of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) develop relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease. Of those patients, 50\% to 60\% show long-term progression-free survival after standard salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). In the past decade, novel therapies have been developed, such as the CD30-directed antibody‚Äìdrug conjugate brentuximab vedotin and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have greatly extended the treatment possibilities for patients with R/R cHL. Several phase 1/2 clinical trials have shown promising results of these new drugs as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, but unfortunately, very few randomized phase 3 trials have been performed in this setting, making it difficult to give evidence-based recommendations for optimal treatment sequencing. Two important goals for the improvement in the treatment of R/R cHL can be identified: (1) increasing long-term progression-free and overall survival by optimizing risk-adapted treatment and (2) decreasing toxicity in patients with a low risk of relapse of disease by evaluating the need for HDCT/ASCT in these patients. In this review, we discuss treatment options for patients with R/R cHL in different settings: patients with a first relapse, primary refractory disease, and in patients who are ineligible or unfit for ASCT. Results of clinical trials investigating novel therapies or strategies published over the past 5 years are summarized.},

Thirty trials were included in the meta-analysis. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.Data on study design, individual characteristics, and outcomes were extracted. All statistics were pooled by applying a random-effects model.The prespecified main outcomes were OS, PFS, and TRM.Of 6548 articles, data extracted from the 30 studies (including 880 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT and 885 who underwent autologous HSCT) were included in this meta-analysis. In the allogeneic HSCT group, a 3-year OS of 50\% (95\% CI, 41\%-60\%) and PFS of 42\% (95\% CI, 35\%-51\%), a 5-year OS of 54\% (95\% CI, 47\%-62\%) and PFS of 48\% (95\% CI, 40\%-56\%), and a 3-year TRM of 32\% (95\% CI, 27\%-37\%) were observed.

To assess long-term outcomes, we report an updated analysis with ‚â•35 months' follow-up. Patients were aged {$>$}18 years, had received one to three prior systemic therapies (including ‚â•1 CD20-targeting regimen) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2. Patients received 28-day cycles of tafasitamab (12 mg/kg intravenously), once weekly during cycles 1-3, then every 2 weeks during cycles 4-12. Lenalidomide (25 mg orally) was administered on days 1-21 of cycles 1-12. After cycle 12, progression-free patients received tafasitamab every 2 weeks until disease progression. The primary endpoint was best objective response rate. After ‚â•35 months' follow-up (data cut-off: October 30, 2020), the objective response rate was 57.5\% (n=46/80), including a complete response in 40.0\% of patients (n=32/80) and a partial response in 17.5\% of patients (n=14/80). The median duration of response was 43.9 months (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 26.1-not reached), the median overall survival was 33.5 months (95\% CI: 18.3-not reached) and the median progression-free survival was 11.6 months (95\% CI: 6.3-45.7). There were no unexpected toxicities. Subgroup analyses revealed consistent long-term efficacy results across most subgroups of patients.

After HSCT, TKIs are increasingly being used to treat or prevent disease relapse, and practice patterns suggest that these TKIs are often chosen empirically without regard to pre-HSCT mutation status. We investigated whether ABL kinase domain mutations persist after transplantation and, thus, whether pre-HSCT mutation status should inform the selection of post-HSCT TKIs in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed adults who underwent allogeneic HSCT for CML and PhÔøΩ+ ALL at our institution between 2000 and 2010, and we identified subjects who had detectable BCR-ABL transcripts by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as available RNA for Sanger sequencing of the ABL kinase domain, in both the pre- and post-HSCT settings. In total, 95 CML and 20 PhÔøΩ+ ALL patients with positive PCR transcripts were identified, of which 10 (10.5\%) and 4 (20.0\%), respectively, were found to have pre-HSCT ABL kinase mutations known to confer TKI resistance. In 9 (64.2\%) of these 14 patients, the same kinase mutation was also detectable at an average time of 191 days after HSCT. Seven (50.0\%) of the 14 harboring mutations had relapsed/refractory disease by last follow-up, of which, in retrospect, 6 had received a predictably ineffective TKI within the first 100 days after transplantation based on our mutation analysis. These data support the idea that pre-existing mutations in the ABL kinase domain, frequently associated with resistance to TKIs and prevalent in a transplantation population, are persistently detectable in the majority of patients after transplantation. We propose that such resistance patterns should be considered when selecting TKIs in the post-HSCT setting, including clinical trials of post-HSCT TKI prophylaxis.},

The incidence increases to more than 30/100 000/year at an age of {$>$}80 years. The median age at diagnosis is 72 years. About 10\% of CLL patients are reported to be younger than 55 years. There is an inherited genetic susceptibility for CLL, with a sixfold to ninefold increased risk for family members of patients with CLL. ‚Ä¢Routine screening for CLL is not recommended either in the general population or in relatives of patients with CLL [V, E]. The diagnosis of CLL is established by the following criteria:1Swerdlow S.H. Campo E. Harris N.L. et al.WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues.4th ed.

Other lymphoma entities to be differentiated from CLL are mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), leukaemic marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (in particular the splenic variant) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. These tumour cells may express B-cell surface antigens and CD5, but in most cases, they do not express CD23, in particular MZL. For cases that express CD23, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for determination of cyclin D1 overexpression, and FISH for detecting a translocation (11;14), but also CD200 expression, are useful for establishing the diagnosis of MCL. Additionally, SOX11 staining may be used on tumour biopsies. A diagnosis of MZL is supported by negative or low CD43 expression and high expression of CD180.4Miguet L. Lennon S.

Radiographic imaging with CT scan is recommended in symptomatic patients, for example in pulmonary symptomatic patients, in order to exclude pulmonary infiltration or pleural effusion by CLL. MRI, chest radiography or abdominal ultrasound (US) may be considered as alternatives if there are contraindications against CT scan or a scan is not available. In general, CT scans of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis or MRI may be helpful to assess the tumour load and risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), particularly before treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. In addition, CT scans may be useful for baseline and final assessment in clinical trials,12Cheson B.D. Fisher R.I.

In daily life, important treatment end points in clinical trials, such as response rate, minimal residual disease (MRD) status or progression-free-survival (PFS), may be more relevant for young and/or fit patients than in older patients and/or patients with relevant comorbidity. Ultimately, in most patients, survival depends on the effect and choice of treatment sequences given along the course of the disease. ‚Ä¢Binet and Rai staging systems with clinical symptoms are relevant for treatment indication [III, A].‚Ä¢del(17p), TP53 mutations and IGHV status are relevant for choice of therapy and should be assessed before treatment [III, A].‚Ä¢Routine evaluation of del(17p), TP53 mutation and IGHV status in early and asymptomatic stage is not recommended [V, D].‚Ä¢Routine imaging during a watch-and-wait period is not recommended unless there are clinical symptoms [V, E]. Previous studies have shown that early treatment with chemotherapeutic agents does not translate into a survival advantage in patients with early-stage CLL.35Dighiero G. Maloum K.

The standard treatment of patients with early disease is a watch-and-wait strategy [I, A]. Blood cell counts and clinical examinations should be carried out every 3-12 months after the first year, when 3-monthly intervals should be applied for all patients. Due to the lack of clinical trials, no evidence-based treatment recommendation can be given for localised, early-stage SLL, but there is consensus that the management of SLL is similar to CLL. Locoregional radiotherapy may only be considered for symptomatic lymphadenopathy in selected patients with localised SLL. ‚Ä¢The standard treatment of patients with early asymptomatic disease is a watch-and-wait strategy [I, A]. In general, whenever possible, patients should be treated within a clinical trial for all lines of therapy. Whereas patients with intermediate- (stage I and II) and high-risk (stage III and IV) disease (according to the modified Rai classification or at Binet stage B or C) usually benefit from the initiation of treatment, some of these patients (in particular Rai intermediate-risk or Binet stage B) can be monitored without therapy until they have evidence for progressive or symptomatic disease (summarised as ‚Äòactive disease‚Äô).2Hallek M.

  abstract = {The approval of brentuximab vedotin (BV) and checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) has revolutionized the management of relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) patients. In recent years these agents have rapidly moved to earlier lines of therapy, including post-autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (auto-HCT) consolidation, pre-HCT salvage, and the frontline treatment setting. This shift in practice means that double-refractory (refractory to both BV and CPI) cHL is becoming an increasingly common clinical problem. In patients who are not eligible for clinical trials, conventional cytotoxic and targeted therapies (off label) may be a potential option. In patients who are transplant eligible, early referral to allogeneic HCT should be considered given the significant improvement in transplant outcomes in the contemporary era. Cellular therapy options including CD30.chimeric antigen receptor T cells, Epstein-Barr virus-directed cytotoxic T cells, and CD16A/30 bispecific natural killer cell engagers appear promising and are currently in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {During conditioning chemotherapy prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), non-transferrin-bound iron and its chelatable form, labile plasma iron (LPI), regularly appear in the blood of patients at high levels of transferrin saturation (TfS). As these free iron species potentially favor infection and mediate transplantation-associated toxicities, chelation therapy could be an approach to improve outcome after transplantation. However, data addressing iron chelation in the immediate peritransplantation period are sparse. In this study, we investigated the influence of iron chelation with deferasirox during conditioning chemotherapy on the appearance of LPI, the incidence of infection and toxicities, and the tolerability of this treatment in the peritransplantation period. We conducted this single-center prospective observational study in 25 adults with iron overload (serum ferritin {$>$}1000 ¬µg/L) undergoing allogeneic HSCT after myeloablative busulfan-based conditioning chemotherapy. Patients received iron chelation with deferasirox (14 mg/kg) from the start of conditioning until day 3 post-transplantation. Iron parameters, including LPI, were obtained at the chelator's trough level daily until day 0 and then on days 4, 7, and 14. Data on infection (bacteremia or invasive fungal disease) and toxicity, as well as the tolerability of deferasirox, were collected until the end of the follow-up period on day 28. Data were analyzed descriptively. TfS levels exceeded 70\% in median on 6 days (range, 4 to 10~days) and in 63.6\% (range, 36.4\% to 90.9\%) of the samples per patient, although in 19 of 25 patients (76\%), no elevated LPI values were detected during the intake of deferasirox despite high TfS levels. Only 6 patients (24\%) showed mildly increased LPI values (‚â§0.5~units) during the intake of deferasirox, 3 of whom had presented with elevated LPI values before the start of conditioning. Deferasirox was well tolerated, and no aggravation of toxicities was observed. Infection occurred in 5 patients (20\%), including 3 of the 6 patients with elevated LPI values despite chelation therapy. In the present study, we demonstrate that iron chelation with deferasirox safely suppresses the appearance of LPI and might decrease the incidence of infection, whereas the impact on transplantation-associated toxicities remains to be elucidated.}

The number of BTK inhibitors (BTKis) in the clinic has increased considerably and currently amounts to at least 22. First-in-class was ibrutinib, an irreversible binder forming a covalent bond to a cysteine in the catalytic region of the kinase, for which we have identified 228 active trials listed at ClinicalTrials.gov. Next-generation inhibitors, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, are approved both in the United States and in Europe, and zanubrutinib also in China, while tirabrutinib is currently only registered in Japan. In most cases, these compounds have been used for the treatment of B-lymphocyte tumors. However, an increasing number of trials instead addresses autoimmunity and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus and systemic lupus erythematosus with the use of either irreversibly binding inhibitors, e.g., evobrutinib and tolebrutinib, or reversibly binding inhibitors, like fenebrutinib. Adverse effects (AEs) have predominantly implicated inhibition of other kinases with a BTKi-binding cysteine in their catalytic domain. Analysis of the reported AEs suggests that ibrutinib-associated atrial fibrillation is caused by binding to ERBB2/HER2 and ERBB4/HER4. However, the binding pattern of BTKis to various additional kinases does not correlate with the common assumption that skin manifestations and diarrhoeas are off-target effects related to EGF receptor inhibition. Moreover, dermatological toxicities, diarrhoea, bleedings and invasive fungal infections often develop early after BTKi treatment initiation and subsequently subside. Conversely, cardiovascular AEs, like hypertension and various forms of heart disease, often persist.},

  abstract = {Abstract  Purpose  We aimed to assess patterns of relapse in patients undergoing salvage autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma in the modern era with the hypothesis that patients who suffer a relapse at initially involved sites are at increased risks of relapse post-ASCT that may help guide the application of peri-transplant radiation therapy.  Methods and Materials  A retrospective review was conducted of 38 patients undergoing ASCT between 2002 and 2017 for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. The site of relapse at the time of ASCT and subsequent relapses were compared with sites of the initial involvement at the time of diagnosis using follow-up imaging (most commonly positron emission computed tomography). Relapse and overall survival rates were calculated from the date of ASCT using the Kaplan-Meier method with a multivariate analysis, completed using a Cox multivariate analysis.  Results  The median follow-up time was 38months (interquartile range, 18-66months). Twenty-two patients (58\%) suffered a relapse after ASCT at a median time to relapse of 9.1months (interquartile range, 2.9-12.3months) with a 5-year risk of relapse of 58\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 41\%-75\%). On univariate analysis, relapse at an initially involved site was significant for higher rates of relapse at 71\% at 5-years (95\% CI, 52\%-90\%) compared with relapse at initially uninvolved sites at 30\% (95\% CI, 2\%-58\%; P=.05). The relapse rate was also significantly higher in patients age  30years (P  Conclusions  Relapses at initially involved sites may potentially increase the risk of relapse after ASCT. Additional studies are needed to clarify whether this should be used as an additional factor to guide recommendations for peri-transplant radiation therapy.},

The IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib was recently approved for IDH2-mutated relapsed or refractory AML.~We conducted a multi-center, phase I trial of maintenance enasidenib following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with IDH2-mutated myeloid malignancies. Two dose levels, 50mg and 100mg daily were studied in a 3 √ó 3 dose-escalation design, with 10 additional patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Enasidenib was initiated between days 30 and 90 following HCT and continued for twelve 28-day cycles. Twenty-three patients were enrolled, of whom 19 initiated post-HCT maintenance.~Two had myelodysplastic syndrome, and 17 had AML. All but 3 were in first complete remission. No dose limiting toxicities were observed, and the RP2D was established at 100mg daily. Attributable grade ‚â•3 toxicities were rare, with the most common being cytopenias. Eight patients stopped maintenance before completing 12 cycles, due to adverse events (n=3), pursuing treatment for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) (n=2), clinician choice (n=1), relapse (n=1), and COVID infection (n=1). No cases of grade ‚â•3 acute GVHD were seen, and 12-month cumulative incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD was 42\% (20-63\%). Cumulative incidence of relapse was 16\% (95\% CI: 3.7-36\%); 1 subject relapsed while receiving maintenance. Two-year progression-free and overall survival were 69\% (95\% CI: 39-86\%) and 74\% (95\% CI, 44-90\%), respectively.

This analysis showed that patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia carry an average of 7.8 lesions/case, with deletions outnumbering gains (88\% versus 12\%). The most common deletions were those targeting IKZF1, PAX5 and CDKN2A/B, which were detected in 84\%, 36\% and 32\% of cases, respectively. Patients carrying simultaneous deletions of IKZF1 plus CDKN2A/B and/or PAX5 had a significantly lower disease-free survival rate (24.9\% versus 43.3\%; P=0.026). The only IKZF1 isoform affecting prognosis was the dominant negative one (P=0.003). Analysis of copy number aberrations showed that 18\% of patients harbored MEF2C deletions, which were of two types, differing in size: the longer deletions were associated with the achievement of a complete molecular remission (P=0.05) and had a favorable impact on disease-free survival (64.3\% versus 32.1\% at 36 months; P=0.031). These findings retained statistical significance also in multivariate analysis (P=0.057). KRAS deletions, detected in 6\% of cases, were associated with the achievement of a complete molecular remission (P=0.009). These results indicate that in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia a detailed evaluation of additional deletions - including CDKN2A/B, PAX5, IKZF1, MEF2C and KRAS - has prognostic implications and should be incorporated in the design of more personalized treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Drug treatments for patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes provide no survival advantage. In this trial, we aimed to assess the effect of azacitidine on overall survival compared with the three commonest conventional care regimens. Methods In a phase III, international, multicentre, controlled, parallel-group, open-label trial, patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes were randomly assigned one-to-one to receive azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 per day for 7 days every 28 days) or conventional care (best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine, or intensive chemotherapy as selected by investigators before randomisation). Patients were stratified by French‚ÄìAmerican‚ÄìBritish and international prognostic scoring system classifications; randomisation was done with a block size of four. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat for all patients assigned to receive treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00071799. Findings Between Feb 13, 2004, and Aug 7, 2006, 358 patients were randomly assigned to receive azacitidine (n=179) or conventional care regimens (n=179). Four patients in the azacitidine and 14 in the conventional care groups received no study drugs but were included in the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. After a median follow-up of 21¬∑1 months (IQR 15¬∑1‚Äì26¬∑9), median overall survival was 24¬∑5 months (9¬∑9‚Äìnot reached) for the azacitidine group versus 15¬∑0 months (5¬∑6‚Äì24¬∑1) for the conventional care group (hazard ratio 0¬∑58; 95\% CI 0¬∑43‚Äì0¬∑77; stratified log-rank p=0¬∑0001). At last follow-up, 82 patients in the azacitidine group had died compared with 113 in the conventional care group. At 2 years, on the basis of Kaplan-Meier estimates, 50¬∑8\% (95\% CI 42¬∑1‚Äì58¬∑8) of patients in the azacitidine group were alive compared with 26¬∑2\% (18¬∑7‚Äì34¬∑3) in the conventional care group (p Interpretation Treatment with azacitidine increases overall survival in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes relative to conventional care.

The UKALLXII/ECOG 2993 study evaluated the outcome of assigning alloHSCT with a sibling (sib) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) to patients younger than 55 years of age achieving complete remission (CR). The CR rate of 267 patients, median age 40, was 82\%. Twenty-eight percent of patients proceeded to alloHSCT in first CR. Age older than 55 years or a pre-HSCT event were the most common reasons for failure to progress to alloHSCT. At 5 years, overall survival (OS) was 44\% after sib alloHSCT, 36\% after MUD alloHSCT, and 19\% after chemotherapy. After adjustment for sex, age, and white blood count and excluding chemotherapy-treated patients who relapsed or died before the median time to alloHSCT, only relapse-free survival remained significantly superior in the alloHSCT group (odds ratio 0.31, 95\% confidence interval 0.16-0.61). An intention-to-treat analysis, using the availability or not of a matched sibling donor, showed 5-year OS to be nonsignificantly better at 34\% with a donor versus 25\% with no donor.

In 2003 imatinib was introduced as a single-agent course following induction (N = 86, late imatinib). In 2005 imatinib was added to the second phase of induction (N = 89, early imatinib). The complete remission (CR) rate was 92\% in the imatinib cohort vs 82\% in the preimatinib cohort (P = .004). At 4 years, the overall survival (OS) of all patients in the imatinib cohort was 38\% vs 22\% in the preimatinib cohort (P = .003). The magnitude of the difference between the preimatinib and imatinib cohorts in event-free survival (EFS), OS, and relapse-free survival (RFS) seen in univariate analysis was even greater in the multivariate analysis. In the preimatinib cohort, 31\% of those starting treatment achieved hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) compared with 46\% in the imatinib cohort. A Cox multivariate analysis taking alloHSCT into account showed a modest additional benefit to imatinib (hazard ratio for EFS = 0.64, 95\% confidence interval 0.44-0.93, P = .02), but no significant benefit for OS and RFS. Adding imatinib to standard therapy improves CR rate and long-term OS for adults with ALL. A proportion of the OS benefit derives from the fact that imatinib facilitates alloHSCT.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Outcomes in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)‚Äìpositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Molecular remission is a primary goal of treatment. METHODS We conducted a phase 2 single-group trial of first-line therapy in adults with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL (with no upper age limit). Dasatinib plus glucocorticoids were administered, followed by two cycles of blinatumomab. The primary end point was a sustained molecular response in the bone marrow after this treatment. RESULTS Of the 63 patients (median age, 54 years; range, 24 to 82) who were enrolled, a complete remission was observed in 98\%. At the end of dasatinib induction therapy (day 85), 29\% of the patients had a molecular response, and this percentage increased to 60\% after two cycles of blinatumomab; the percentage of patients with a molecular response increased further after additional blinatumomab cycles. At a median follow-up of 18 months, overall survival was 95\% and disease-free survival was 88\%; disease-free survival was lower among patients who had an IKZF1 deletion plus additional genetic aberrations (CDKN2A or CDKN2B, PAX5, or both [i.e., IKZF1plus]). ABL1 mutations were detected in 6 patients who had increased minimal residual disease during induction therapy, and all these mutations were cleared by blinatumomab. Six relapses occurred. Overall, 21 adverse events of grade 3 or higher were recorded. A total of 24 patients received a stem-cell allograft, and 1 death was related to transplantation (4\%). CONCLUSIONS A chemotherapy-free induction and consolidation first-line treatment with dasatinib and blinatumomab that was based on a targeted and immunotherapeutic strategy was associated with high incidences of molecular response and survival and few toxic effects of grade 3 or higher in adults with Ph-positive ALL.

The UK Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Forum collected data from UK/Ireland patients with a minimum of 1 year follow-up with pre-planned primary endpoints; the number of patients still on therapy at 1 year "discontinuation-free survival" and 1 year overall survival. With a median of 16 months follow up, data on 315 patients demonstrated a 1 year discontinuation-free survival of 73.7\% and a 1 year overall survival of 83.8\%. Patients with better pre-treatment performance status (0/1 vs. 2+) had superior discontinuation-free survival (77.5\% vs. 61.3\%; P 14 days and had an overall survival rate of 89.7\%, while 26\% of patients had dose reductions and 13\% had temporary treatment breaks of {$>$}14 days. We could not demonstrate a detrimental effect of dose reductions alone (1 year overall survival: 91.7\%), but patients who had first year treatment breaks of {$>$}14 days, particularly permanent cessation of ibrutinib had both reduced 1 year overall survival (68.5\%), and also a statistically significant excess mortality rate beyond one year. Although outcomes appear inferior to the RESONATE trial (1 year overall survival; 90\%: progression-free survival; 84\%), this may partly reflect the inclusion of performance status 2+ patients, and that 17.5\% of patients permanently discontinued ibrutinib due to an event other than disease progression.},

  abstract = {Disease overview Follicular lymphoma (FL) is generally an indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular center B cells. Follicular lymphoma is characterized by diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, and splenomegaly. Extranodal involvement is less common. Cytopenias are relatively common but constitutional symptoms of fever, night sweats, and weight loss are uncommon in the absence of transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Diagnosis The diagnosis is based on histology from a biopsy of a lymph node or other affected tissue. Incisional biopsy is preferred over needle biopsies in order to give adequate tissue to assign grade and assess for transformation. Immunohistochemical staining is positive in virtually all cases for cell surface CD19, CD20, CD10 and monoclonal immunoglobulin, as well as cytoplasmic expression of bcl-2 protein. The overwhelming majority of cases have the characteristic t(14;18) translocation involving the IgH/bcl-2 genes. Risk stratification The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) uses five independent predictors of inferior survival: age {$>$} 60 years, hemoglobin {$<$}12 g/dL, serum LDH {$>$} normal, Ann Arbor stage III/IV, number of involved nodal areas {$>$}4. The presence of 0-1, 2, and ‚â• 3 adverse factors defines low, intermediate, and high-risk disease. There are other clinical prognostic models but the FLIPI remains the most common. Other factors such as time to relapse of less than 2 years from chemoimmunotherapy and specific gene mutations may also be useful for prognosis. Regardless of the prognostic model used, modern therapies have demonstrably improved prognosis. Risk-adapted therapy Observation continues to be appropriate for asymptomatic patients with low bulk disease and no cytopenias. There is no overall survival advantage for early treatment with either chemotherapy or single agent rituximab. For patients needing therapy, most patients are treated with chemoimmunotherapy, which has improved response rates, duration of response and overall survival (OS). Randomized studies have shown additional benefit for maintenance rituximab. Lenalidomide was non-inferior to chemoimmunotherapy in a randomized front-line study and, when combined with rituximab, was superior to rituximab alone in relapsed FL. Kinase inhibitors, other immunotherapies, and stem cell transplantation (SCT) are also considered for recurrent disease.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, treatment approaches for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have improved significantly. Treatment of MDS is tailored to the specific risk characteristics of the patient. In general, patients are divided into lower- and higher-risk categories. Without therapy, prognosis of patients with higher-risk MDS is poor, and treatments should be directed to improve survival. Prognosis of patients with lower-risk MDS is more heterogeneous, and therapies are usually directed to minimize transfusion needs and potentially to alter the natural course of the disease. Treatment options for patients with higher-risk MDS include hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine), intensive chemotherapy (ICT), and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT). The use of the hypomethylating agents has transformed the approach to this patient population, in particular older individuals, for whom ICT and alloSCT are not an option. In lower-risk MDS, treatment strategies are used sequentially and usually include observation in patients with low risk and no transfusion dependency, growth factors, and lenalidomide for patients with alteration of chromosome 5 and anemia. The use of hypomethylating agents is less understood in this group of patients. AlloSCT is usually reserved for patients with lower-risk MDS closer to the time of transformation. In this short review, we discuss treatment alternatives for patients with MDS and delineate some of the ongoing challenges, including the development of better front-line strategies for patients with higher-risk disease, the concept of altering the natural course of the disease in lower-risk MDS, and the development of new treatment approaches for patients who do not benefit from hypomethylating agents.}

Patients and Methods Patients received decitabine 20 mg/m2 SC per day for 3 consecutive days on days 1, 2, and 3 every 28 days (schedule A) or 20 mg/m2 SC per day once every 7 days on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days (schedule B) for up to 1 year. Primary efficacy end point was overall improvement rate (OIR: complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], marrow CR [mCR], or hematologic improvement [HI]).

  abstract = {Background The EUMDS registry is an unique prospective, longitudinal observational registry enrolling newly diagnosed patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) from 17 European countries from both university hospitals and smaller regional hospitals. Objective The aim of this study was to describe the usage and clinical impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in 1696 patients enrolled between 2008 and 2014. Methods The effects of ESAs on outcomes were assessed using proportional hazards models weighting observations by propensity to receive ESA treatment within a subset of anaemic patients with or without a regular transfusion need. Results ESA treatment (median duration of 27.5 months, range 0‚Äì77 months) was administered to 773 patients (45.6\%). Outcomes were assessed in 897 patients (484 ESA treated and 413 untreated). ESA treatment was associated with a nonsignificant survival benefit (HR 0.82, 95\% CI: 0.65‚Äì1.04, P = 0.09); this benefit was larger amongst patients without prior transfusions (P = 0.07). Amongst 539 patients for whom response to ESA treatment could be defined, median time to first post-ESA treatment transfusion was 6.1 months (IQR: 4.3‚Äì15.9 months) in those transfused before ESA treatment compared to 23.3 months (IQR: 7.0‚Äì47.8 months) in patients without prior transfusions (HR 2.4, 95\% CI: 1.7‚Äì3.3, P {$<$} 0.0001). Responding patients had a better prognosis in terms of a lower risk of death (HR 0.65, 95\% CI: 0.45‚Äì0.893, P = 0.018), whereas there was no significant effect on the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (HR 0.71, 95\% CI: 0.39‚Äì1.29, P = 0.27). Conclusion Appropriate use of ESAs can significantly delay the onset of a regular transfusion need in patients with lower-risk MDS.}

  abstract = {Background: The EUMDS Registry started in 2008 as a prospective, non-interventional longitudinal study, enrolling newly diagnosed patients with IPSS low or intermediate-1 MDS from 16 European countries and Israel. Aims: The aim of the present analysis was to see how treatment with or without Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs) and/or red blood cell transfusions (RBCT) impact overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Methods: Patient management was recorded electronically every 6 months (‚Äúvisit‚Äù) in a central database, including treatment, transfusions, blood values, and health related quality of life (HRQoL) using the EQ-5D 3-Level index and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patients were eligible to be included in the analyses if their hemoglobin was recorded as less than {$<$}10 g/dl at a visit. To overcome potential confounding by non-random allocation of ESA treatment, propensity score matching was performed to ensure that treated and untreated patients had similar characteristics. Only patients with comparable propensity scores were included in the analyses to estimate the effects of ESA treatment on outcomes using standard time to event analyses; OS was estimated from the first visit a Hb value of {$<$}10g/dl was recorded. OS was examined for patients treated with ESA stratified by their transfusion status prior to commencing ESA treatment (no RBCT, {$<$}4 units, ‚â•4 units). Patients were separated into 4 groups at each clinical visit, depending on the treatment received in the interval leading up to that visit; no ESA nor RBCT, ESA only, ESA and RBCT and RBCT only. HRQoL at each visit according to the treatment status was summarized for patients who had completed a questionnaire at visit 1 and 2; mean values were examined by treatment group. Results: Of 2562 patients registered by November 2021, 2448 were diagnosed before July 2019 and included in the analysis; these patients were divided into two groups: ESA untreated (n=1265) and ESA treated (n=1183). Patients whose Hb remained above 10g/dl were excluded leaving 529 untreated patients and 749 ESA treated; after propensity score matching was applied two comparable groups were produced: ESA untreated (n= 426) and ESA treated (n= 742). Median OS from reaching the eligibility criteria in the ESA treated vs untreated groups were 44.9 and 34.8 months respectively (Fig 1a), giving a clear survival advantage to the ESA-treated group. (p{$<$}0.003). In the ESA-treated group, OS was poorer in those who had been transfused prior to commencing ESA (Fig 1b, p{$<$}0.001). Fig 1c shows the number of patients at each visit who had been treated with transfusions or ESA; 647/1278 had received neither at visit 1, the figure shows the ‚Äúflow‚Äù of patients by treatment for the first 6 visits. HRQoL was examined for the 695 patients who had completed a questionnaire at both visit 1 and 2 up to visit 6; differences were seen by treatment (Fig 1d). Patients who had received no treatment reported, on average, the highest mean HRQoL, in contrast, patients who had RBCT had the lowest (p{$<$}0.001). Image:Summary/Conclusion: This unique large prospective registry study clearly shows a significant survival advantage for lower-risk MDS patients exposed to ESA treatment at onset of anemia (Hb {$<$}10g/dL) but before onset of transfusion therapy, strongly supporting recommendations to start ESA treatment early. The effect on patients with an early transfusion need warrants further studies. Moreover, ESA exposure is associated with maintained QoL, while RBCT development with or without ESA exposure is associated with significantly deterioration in QoL.},

Salvage high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant remains the standard second-line treatment for relapsed or refractory patients, and recently, three CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART) cell products have been approved beyond 2 prior lines of systemic therapy. Nevertheless, some patients are not eligible for transplant or CARTs, or progress after these treatments. In this context, IgG-like bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have been designed to treat B‚Äêcell lymphomas. They combine two different monospecific antigen‚Äêbinding regions that target CD20 on B cells and engage T cells via CD3 in a 1:1 or 2:1 CD20:CD3 antigen binding fragment (Fab) format. The results of different phase 1 trials with BsAbs, including mosunetuzumab, glofitamab, epcoritamab and odeonextamab, have been recently published. They are infused intravenously or subcutaneously, and have a favorable toxicity profile, with reduced cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicity. Moreover, these BsAbs have demonstrated very promising efficacy in B-cell lymphomas, including in aggressive lymphomas. New trials are currently ongoing to confirm BsAbs efficacy and tolerability, as well as to explore its efficacy in different lines of therapy or in combination with other drugs.},

All transplantations used reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. Total-body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide and fludarabine was the predominant regimen for HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was uniformly posttransplantation cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitor, and mycophenolate. Fludarabine with busulfan or melphalan was the predominant regimen for HLA-matched unrelated donor HCT, and GVHD prophylaxis was calcineurin inhibitor with mycophenolate or methotrexate. Results of multivariate analysis revealed higher relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; P = .0055; 2-year relapse rate, 48\% vs 33\%) and lower disease-free survival (DFS) rates after HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT (HR, 1.29; P = .042; 2-year DFS, 29\% vs 36\%). However, overall survival (OS) rates did not differ between donor type (HR, 0.94; P = .65; 2-year OS, 46\% for HLA-haploidentical and 44\% for HLA-matched unrelated donor HCT) because of mortality associated with chronic GVHD. Acute grade 2 to 4 GVHD (HR, 0.44; P {$<$} .0001) and chronic GVHD (HR, 0.36; P {$<$} .0001) were lower after HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT. By 2 years, probability of death resulting from chronic GVHD was lower after HLA-haploidentical relative compared with HLA-matched unrelated donor HCT (6\% vs 21\%), negating any potential survival advantage from better relapse control. Both donor types extend access to transplantation for patients with MDS; strategies for better relapse control are desirable for HLA-haploidentical relative donor HCT, and effective GVHD prophylaxis regimens are needed for unrelated donor HCT.}

Axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel have been approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell and mediastinal Lymphoma (NHL) patients (pts). Selection of pts who can benefit the most from these novel treatments with a low risk of life-threatening toxicities is currently a matter of discussion and outside clinical trials the selection of pts is up to clinicians of the CAR T-cell team in several countries. However, based on the results and follow up of clinical trials and the US reports about real life treatment with CAR T-cells, it is emerging that an expert clinical assessment and application of some inclusion criteria could optimize the success of therapy and minimize the severity of adverse events.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}AIMS.We are conducting a single center prospective observational trial to evaluate the accessibility and feasibility of CAR T-cells treatment among the population of NHL pts potentially eligible to this therapy.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}METHODS. Since September 2018 we have prospectively registered all pts referred at our center for CART-cells eligibility evaluation either for the enrollment in clinical trials or in the contest of the expanded access program (EAP) open for enrollment since February 2019 at our Institution. We have recorded clinical data including disease characteristics, comorbidities, history and present disease status at imaging. Patients were evaluated and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria of the CAR T-cells program available at that moment and planned for treatment.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}RESULTS. Fifty-four pts with relapsed or refractory NHL potentially eligible to treatment according to EMA were recorded in 10 months. Median age was 48 yrs (range, 20 - 70). Thirty-nine pts were affected by DLBCL and 15 by PMBCL, all pts were refractory or relapsed to at least two chemotherapy regimens, median number of previous therapy was 3. Overall, among the 54 pts referred to our center only 7 pts (13\%) have been enrolled in CAR T-cells programs (4 pts treated, 2 pts are waiting for infusion, one is in screening for a protocol) whereas other 11 (20\%) have been considered eligible for CART-cells treatment but are still waiting for availability of treatment-slots.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}On the contrary 36 pts were considered not eligible. Seventeen pts (31\%) were excluded after the first CAR T cell team visit because of rapidly progressive disease, or ECOG \&gt;1 or lymphoma mass larger than 20 cm and 7 pts (13\%) were excluded for comorbidities. Nine pts requiring a treatment in a short time period were shifted to other strategies (conventional or experimental) and 3 pts were lost at follow-up.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Overall 18 pts in 10 months (33\%) have been considered eligible but only 7 out of 18 have been treated, remaining pts are waiting for the treatment. One third of pts have been excluded and cardiopathy, uncontrolled progressive disease and poor performance status represent the major causes for not being eligible to treatment. More criteria such as high ferritin levels, total tumor volume and active infections will delineate even better the patient population really receiving the infusion.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}CONCLUSIONS. Among all pts with relapsed and refractory NHL referred at our Center only 33\% presented clinical and disease characteristics suitable for CAR T-cells treatment. Moreover, the majority of eligible pts are at the risk of becoming ineligible because of poor disease control. The time needed to plan the apheresis and the 4-5 weeks period to obtain CAR T-cells is a major obstacle to a larger applicability of this strategy, therefore exclusion of pts with large tumor mass and with rapid progressive disease is indicated. Probably, CAR T-cells treatment needs to be planned earlier in the disease course to optimize the outcome. In Italy the feasibility over the last 10 months of CAR T-cells treatment has been largely unsatisfactory and primarily limited by the lack of commercial products.

Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science. A novel, query-based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall, and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analyzed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognize the requirements of evidence synthesis and for academic journals to reassess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis.},

  abstract = {The treatment of older patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an unmet medical need. In Western countries, the population is aging, which means there will be an increasing number of older patients. However, in the past few decades, there has been little improvement in treating them, and few clinical trials specifically designed for older patients with ALL have been reported. Older patients with ALL have a significantly lower complete response rate, higher early mortality, higher relapse rate, and poorer survival compared with younger patients. This is partly explained by a higher incidence of poor prognostic factors. Most importantly, intensive chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation, both of which are successful in younger patients, is less well tolerated in older patients. For the future, the most promising approaches are optimized supportive care, targeted therapies, moderately intensified consolidation, and reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation. One of the most important challenges for physicians is to differentiate between fit and unfit older patients in order to offer both groups optimal treatment regarding toxicity and mortality risks, quality of life, and long-term outcome. Prospective trials for older patients with ALL are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Novel approaches are required to improve outcomes in relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We aimed to evaluate camidanlumab tesirine, an anti-CD25 antibody-drug conjugate, in this patient population. METHODS: This was a phase 1, dose-escalation (part 1), dose-expansion (part 2), multicentre trial done in 12 hospital sites (seven in the USA and five in the UK). Adults (‚â•18 years old) with pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, who had no therapies available to them with established clinical benefit for their disease stage were enrolled. Camidanlumab tesirine was administered intravenously (3-150 Œºg/kg) once every 3 weeks. Primary objectives were to assess dose-limiting toxicity, determine maximum tolerated dose and recommended expansion dose(s), and assess safety of camidanlumab tesirine. Safety was assessed in all treated patients; antitumour activity was assessed in patients with one or more valid baseline and post-baseline disease assessment and in those who had disease progression or died after first study-drug dose. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02432235. FINDINGS: Between Oct 5, 2015, and Jun 30, 2019, 133 patients were enrolled (77 [58\%] had classical Hodgkin lymphoma and 56 (42\%) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Median follow-up was 9¬∑2 months (IQR 4¬∑2-14¬∑3). Eight dose-limiting toxicities were reported in five (6\%) of 86 patients who were evaluable; the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The recommended doses for expansion were 30 Œºg/kg and 45 Œºg/kg for patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma and 80 Œºg/kg for patients with T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. No recommended doses for expansion were defined for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events (reported by ‚â•10\% of the 133 patients) included increased Œ≥-glutamyltransferase (20 [15\%] patients), maculopapular rash (16 [12\%]), and anaemia (15 [11\%]); 74 (56\%) patients had serious treatment-emergent adverse events, most commonly pyrexia (16 [12\%]). One (1\%) fatal treatment-emergent adverse event and two (2\%) deaths outside the reporting period were considered at least possibly study-drug related. Antitumoural activity was seen in classical Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas; notably in all patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the overall response was 71\% (95\% CI 60-81). INTERPRETATION: These results warrant evaluation of camidanlumab tesirine as a potential treatment option for relapsed or refractory lymphoma, particularly in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

MDS is distinguished from nonneoplastic clonal myeloid proliferations by the presence of morphologic dysplasia and from acute myeloid leukemia by a blast threshold of 20\%. The diagnosis of MDS can be challenging because of the myriad other causes of cytopenias: accurate diagnosis requires the integration of clinical features with bone marrow and peripheral blood morphology, immunophenotyping, and genetic testing. MDS has historically been subdivided into several subtypes by classification schemes, the most recent of which are the International Consensus Classification and World Health Organization Classification (fifth edition), both published in 2022. The aim of MDS classification is to identify entities with shared genetic underpinnings and molecular pathogenesis, and the specific subtype can inform clinical decision-making alongside prognostic risk categorization. The current MDS classification schemes incorporate morphologic features (bone marrow and blood blast percentage, degree of dysplasia, ring sideroblasts, bone marrow fibrosis, and bone marrow hypocellularity) and also recognize 3 entities defined by genetics: isolated del(5q) cytogenetic abnormality, SF3B1 mutation, and TP53 mutation. It is anticipated that with advancing understanding of the genetic basis of MDS pathogenesis, future MDS classification will be based increasingly on genetic classes. Nevertheless, morphologic features in MDS reflect the phenotypic expression of the underlying abnormal genetic pathways and will undoubtedly retain importance to inform prognosis and guide treatment.}

Numerous efforts have been made to improve the efficacy of the standard regimen by, for example, dose intensification or adding novel agents. However, these results generally failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefits. Hence, understanding treatment resistance is a pressing need to optimize the outcome of those patients. In this Review, we first describe the conceptual sources of treatment resistance in DLBCL and then provide detailed and up-to-date molecular insight into the mechanisms of resistance to the current treatment options in DLBCL. We lastly highlight the potential strategies for rationally managing treatment resistance from both the preventive and interventional perspectives.},

However, our understanding of the metastatic process, and thus our~ability to prevent or eliminate metastases, remains frustratingly limited. This is largely due to the complexity of metastasis, which is a multistep process that likely differs across cancer types and is greatly influenced by many aspects of the in vivo microenvironment. In this Review, we discuss the key variables to consider when designing assays to study metastasis: which source of metastatic cancer cells to use and where to introduce them into mice to address different questions of metastasis biology. We also examine methods that are being used to interrogate specific steps of the metastatic cascade in mouse models, as well as emerging techniques that may shed new light on previously inscrutable aspects of metastasis. Finally, we explore approaches for developing and using anti-metastatic therapies, and how mouse models can be used to test them.},

The treatment outcome of these patients is heterogeneous. This study assessed whether such clinical heterogeneity could be partially explained by the presence and characteristics of additional chromosomal abnormalities. Cytogenetic descriptions were available for 249 of 326 children with Ph+ ALL, diagnosed and treated by 10 different study groups/large single institutions from 1986 to 1996. Secondary aberrations were present in 61\% of the cases. Chromosomes 9, 22, 7, 14, and 8 were most frequently abnormal. Most (93\%) karyotypes were unbalanced. Three main cytogenetic subgroups were identified: no secondary aberrations, gain of a second Ph and/or {$>$}50 chromosomes, or loss of chromosome 7, 7p, and/or 9p, while other secondary aberrations were grouped as combinations of gain and loss or others. Of the three main cytogenetic subgroups, the loss group had the worst event-free survival (P=0.124) and disease-free survival (P=0.013). However, statistical significance was not maintained when adjusted for other prognostic factors and treatment. Karyotypic analysis is valuable in subsets of patients identified by molecular screening, to assess the role of additional chromosomal abnormalities and their correlation with clinical heterogeneity, with possible therapeutic implications.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory ( R/ R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after first-line treatment who are unable to undergo consolidative high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have poor outcomes and limited treatment options. Rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) is a common immuno-chemotherapy regimen used in this setting. The objective of the open-label, phase 3, NIVEAU study (NCT03366272) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nivolumab added to R-GemOx in pts with R/ R LBCL after 1 prior line of therapy not eligible for HDCT/HSCT owing to age and/or comorbidities.Patients and Methods: Eligible pts were adults with R/R LBCL that were refractory to or had relapsed after first-line immuno-chemotherapy and who were not deemed candidates for HDCT/HSCT based on physician's assessment and at least one of the following criteria: age ‚â•65 years; age ‚â•18 years and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) score ‚â•3; or age ‚â•18 years and prior ASCT (as 1st line consolidation). Therapy consisted of 8 cycles R-GemOx (arm A) or 8 cycles of nivolumab plus R-GemOx followed by nivolumab as maintenance for up to 1 year in total or until progression or unacceptable toxicity (arm B). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) after 1 year. Major secondary endpoints were response rates, event-free- (EFS) (time to progression, relapse, death or unplanned anti-lymphoma treatment), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. The protocol specified a pre-planned interim analysis after the first 180 pts completed up to at least 1 follow-up investigation.Results: Between Jan 2018 and May 2021, 180 pts were randomized. Two pts did not receive any treatment (one withdrawn informed consent, one death) resulting in a full analysis set of n=90 (arm A) and n=88 (arm B). Median age was 76 years (range 44-87), 52\% of pts were \&gt;75 years of age, 37\% were primary progressive after first-line therapy, 62\% had IPI 3-5. Overall response (OR) and complete response (CR) rates were similar with 34\% and 20\% (arm A) vs. 34\% and 22\% (arm B), respectively. Rates of progressive disease (PD) were 53\% (arm A) vs. 50\% (arm B). After a median follow-up of 21 months, 1-year PFS was 28\% (95\%-CI: 18\%-37\%) in arm A vs. 20\% (95\%-CI: 11\%-28\%), (p=0.827) in arm B (Figure A). 1-year EFS was 22\% (95\%-CI: 13\%-31\%) in arm A vs. 20\% (95\%-CI: 11\%-28\%), (p=0.654) in arm B. One-year OS was 48\% (95\%-CI: 38\%-59\%) in arm A vs. 58\% (95\%-CI: 47\%-68\%), (p=0.126) in arm B. At 2 years, PFS, EFS and OS were 15\% (95\%-CI: 6\%-24\%), 13\% (95\%.CI: 5\%-21\%) and 34\% (95\%-CI: 22\%-46\%) in arm A vs. 15\% (95\%-CI: 7\%-23\%), 15\% (95\%-CI: 7\%-23\%) an 43\% (95\%-CI: 32\%-55\%) in arm B. Because of an identical PFS but a trend toward better OS for arm B, we performed an event-driven OS analysis of pts after second progression or relapse (n=70 in arm A, n= 73 in arm B). OS survival was superior in arm B vs. arm A after second progression or relapse (Log Rank p= 0.010) (Figure B). There was a small increase in number of pts with grade 3-5 AEs in arm B (arm A/arm B: thrombocytopenia 37\%/39\%; anemia 19\%/26\%; leukopenia 19\%/24\%; infection 15\%/22\%). No increase in number of pts with immune-related grade 3-5 AEs was observed except asymptomatic increase of lipase (arm A/arm B: 23\%/27\%), (p=0.625) and amylase (arm A/arm B: 5\%/11\%), (p=0.192). Most common grade 3-5 AEs during nivolumab consolidation in arm B were leukopenia 13\%, peripheral neuropathy 10\%, increase of lipase 8\%, anemia 5\% and infection 5\% of pts). In total, 7 treatment-related deaths occurred (arm A/arm B: 3 (3\%)/4 (5\%).After this interim analysis revealed futility to demonstrate superiority for the primary endpoint, recruitment was stopped in March 2023. At that point, 270 of 310 initially intended pts had been recruited.Conclusions: In pts with R/R LBCL, the addition of nivolumab to R-GemOx followed by nivolumab maintenance is feasible without relevant additive toxicity. The addition of Nivolumab did not improve PFS of the R-GemOx regimen alone. These results demonstrate the poor prognosis of R/R transplant-ineligible pts treated with immuno-chemotherapy. However, a trend towards a better OS was observed, which allows for the hypothesis that nivolumab might enhance the efficacy of subsequent therapies. The final analysis of the study is scheduled after completion of follow-up of the last patient included as defined by the study protocol.},

  abstract = {Treatment with erythropoietin (epo) may improve the anemia of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in approximately 20\% of patients. Previous studies have suggested that treatment with the combination of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and epo may increase this response rate. In the present phase II study, patients with MDS and anemia were randomized to treatment with G-CSF + epo according to one of two alternatives; arm A starting with G-CSF for 4 weeks followed by the combination for 12 weeks, and arm B starting with epo for 8 weeks followed by the combination for 10 weeks. Fifty evaluable patients (10 refractory anemia [RA], 13 refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts [RARS], and 27 refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB]) were included in the study, three were evaluable only for epo as monotherapy and 47 for the combined treatment. The overall response rate to G-CSF + epo was 38\%, which is identical to that in our previous study. The response rates for patients with RA, RARS, and RAEB were 20\%, 46\%, and 37\%, respectively. Response rates were identical in the two treatment groups indicating that an initial treatment with G-CSF was not neccessary for a response to the combination. Nine patients in arm B showed a response to the combined treatment, but only three of these responded to epo alone. This suggests a synergistic effect in vivo by G-CSF + epo. A long-term follow-up was made on 71 evaluable patients from both the present and the preceding Scandinavian study on G-CSF + epo. Median survival was 26 months, and the overall risk of leukemic transformation during a median follow-up of 43 months was 28\%. Twenty patients entered long-term maintenance treatment and showed a median duration of response of 24 months.The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) was effective to predict survival, leukemic transformation, and to a lesser extent, duration of response, but had no impact on primary response rates.}

  abstract = {The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) constitute a profoundly heterogeneous myeloid malignancy with a common origin in the hemopoietic stem cell compartment. Consequently, patient management and treatment are as heterogeneous. Decision-making includes identifying risk, symptoms, and options for an individual and conducting a risk-benefit analysis. The only potential cure is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and albeit the fraction of patients with MDS who undergo transplant increase over time because of better management and increased donor availability, a majority are not eligible for this intervention. Current challenges encompass to decrease the relapse risk, the main cause of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation failure. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) constitute firstline treatment for higher-risk MDSs. Combinations with other drugs as firstline treatment has, to date, not proven more efficacious than monotherapy, although combinations approved for acute myeloid leukemia, including venetoclax, are under evaluation and often used as rescue treatment. The treatment goal for lower-risk MDS is to improve cytopenia, mainly anemia, quality of life, and, possibly, overall survival. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) constitute firstline treatment for anemia and have better and more durable responses if initiated before the onset of a permanent transfusion need. Treatment in case of ESA failure or ineligibility should be tailored to the main disease mechanism: immunosuppression for hypoplastic MDS without high-risk genetics, lenalidomide for low-risk del(5q) MDS, and luspatercept for MDS with ring sideroblasts. Approved therapeutic options are still scarcer for MDS than for most other hematologic malignancies. Better tools to match disease biology with treatment, that is, applied precision medicines are needed to improve patient outcome.},

For example, with an 8-gauge (3.26~mm) trocar, one can consider that if the transverse thickness of the spongiousus bone of the iliac wing is {$<$}3~mm, it will be difficult to insert the trocar safely between the two tables.},

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assessment is a sensitive, potentially prognostic tool in this setting. We assessed baseline ctDNA to identify patients with R/R DLBCL at high risk of relapse after receiving polatuzumab vedotin and bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) or BR alone. Patients were transplant ineligible and had received ‚â•1 prior line of therapy. The ctDNA assay, based on a customized panel of recurrently mutated genes in DLBCL, measured mutant molecules per mL (MMPM) at baseline and end of treatment (EOT). Endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in subgroups stratified by baseline ctDNA and log-fold change in ctDNA at EOT vs baseline. In biomarker-evaluable patients (n = 33), baseline ctDNA level correlated with serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration, number of prior therapies, stage, and International Prognostic Index (IPI). After adjusting for number of prior therapies ‚â•2, IPI score ‚â•3, and LDH above the upper limit of normal, high (greater than median) baseline ctDNA MMPM was independently prognostic for shorter PFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.18 [95\% CI, 0.05-0.65]) and OS (adjusted HR, 0.20 [95\% CI, 0.06-0.68]). In 23 patients with baseline and EOT samples, a significantly greater decrease in ctDNA MMPM was observed in patients with complete response (CR) (n = 13) than those without CR~(n = 10); P = .0025. Baseline ctDNA assessment may identify patients at high risk of progression and should be further evaluated as a monitoring tool in R/R DLBCL.

For some patients with limited disease stages I and II, radiotherapy may be associated with durable responses; however, it is unclear whether patients are cured and new approaches such as the combination of irradiation with rituximab or even single-agent rituximab need to be explored. Whereas watch and wait is the current standard for stage III and IV disease with low tumour burden, better indices are warranted to potentially select patients for whom early intervention is preferred. For advanced stages with a high tumour burden, immunochemotherapy followed by 2 years of rituximab maintenance is widely accepted as standard therapy, although re-treatment at recurrence may be an alternative option. Highly attractive new therapeutic options have recently arisen from new antibodies, and from new agents targeting oncogenic pathways such as B-cell receptor signalling pathways or inhibition of bcl 2. Furthermore, immunomodulatory drugs may add to the therapeutic armamentarium and may lead to 'chemotherapy-free' therapies in the near future. Hence, the management of FLs has become a moving target and the hope is justified that the long-term perspectives of patients suffering from the disease will be further improved in the near future.},

  abstract = {T cell-mediated hyperinflammatory responses, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are now well-established toxicities of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. As the field of CAR T cells advances, however, there is increasing recognition that hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-like toxicities following CAR T cell infusion are occurring broadly across patient populations and CAR T cell constructs. Importantly, these HLH-like toxicities are often not as directly associated with CRS and/or its severity as initially described. This emergent toxicity, however ill-defined, is associated with life-threatening complications, creating an urgent need for improved identification and optimal management. With the goal of improving patient outcomes and formulating a framework to characterize and study this HLH-like syndrome, we established an American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy panel composed of experts in primary and secondary HLH, pediatric and adult HLH, infectious disease, rheumatology and hematology, oncology, and cellular therapy. Through this effort, we provide an overview of the underlying biology of classical primary and secondary HLH, explore its relationship with similar manifestations following CAR T cell infusions, and propose the term ‚Äúimmune effector cell-associated HLH-like syndrome (IEC-HS)‚Äù to describe this emergent toxicity. We also delineate a framework for identifying IEC-HS and put forward a grading schema that can be used to assess severity and facilitate cross-trial comparisons. Additionally, given the critical need to optimize outcomes for patients experiencing IEC-HS, we provide insight into potential treatment approaches and strategies to optimize supportive care and delineate alternate etiologies that should be considered in a patient presenting with IEC-HS. By collectively defining IEC-HS as a hyperinflammatory toxicity, we can now embark on further study of the pathophysiology underlying this toxicity profile and make strides toward a more comprehensive assessment and treatment approach.},

  abstract = {Background: The TIGER-trial (NCT01657604) is a multicenter, randomized phase III study to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of nilotinib (NIL) vs NIL+pegylated interferon alpha2b (IFN) combination therapy with IFN maintenance as first-line treatment for patients (pts) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. Methods: A total of 717 pts were recruited from 110 sites in Germany, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. A pilot phase (n=25) validated the feasibility of the combination of NIL 300 mg BID and IFN (30-50¬µg/week according to tolerability and commenced after ‚â•6 weeks NIL monotherapy). In the main phase, 692 pts were randomly assigned to NIL (n=353) and NIL/IFN (n=339). Achievement of major molecular remission (MMR, BCR::ABL1 ‚â§0.1\% on the International Scale, IS) after {$>$}24 months (mo) of therapy was the trigger to start the maintenance phase; treatment-free remission (TFR) started in pts with ‚â•12 mo persistence of MR 4 ( BCR::ABL1 ‚â§0.01\% IS) after {$>$}36 mo total therapy. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CML24 questionnaires. Results: From 692 randomized pts, 411 were male (59\%), median age was 51 years (range, 18-85). In the monotherapy arm, median treatment duration with NIL was 3.1 years (0.02-8.9), median daily dose 600 mg (183-764). In the combination arm, median treatment duration with NIL was 2.3 years (0.02-9.1), median daily dose 600 mg (106-792). Median duration of IFN therapy was 2.4 years (0-9.0). A median of 77 (0-485) IFN injections were administered, the median dose of IFN per injection was 30¬µg (0-50). Probabilities of MMR and MR 4.5 ( BCR::ABL1 ‚â§0.0032\% IS, Fig 1) by 24 mo were 89\% (95\% CI: 85-92\%) and 49\% (44-55\%) vs 93\% (89-95\%) and 64\% (59-69\%) with NIL vs NIL/IFN, respectively. In 356 pts (53\%) qualifying for the discontinuation phase (NIL, n=197; NIL/IFN, n=159), probabilities of maintained MMR by 24 mo were 53\% (45-60\%) and 62\% (54-70\%) after NIL and NIL/IFN, respectively, in an intention-to-treat-analysis (p=0.13). 273 (40\%) eligible pts actually discontinued therapy (per-protocol-analysis, NIL, n=163; NIL/IFN, n=110). Probabilities of TFR by 24 mo were 53\% (45-61\%) vs 59\% (49-68\%) for NIL and NIL/IFN, respectively (Fig 2). Fifteen pts (2.2\%) with atypical BCR::ABL1 transcripts (e1a2, n=7; e19a2, n=4; e8a2, n=2; e13a3 and e14a3, n=1 each) were randomized to receive NIL (n=7) or NIL/IFN (n=8). After a median treatment period of 37 mo (36-39) 9 pts achieved and maintained a BCR::ABL1 reduction of at least 4 orders of magnitude and were eligible for TFR. 6 pts failed to achieve an individual transcript decline by at least 3 logs. TFR was commenced in 7 and maintained in 6 pts after 32 (range, 20-84) mo. Adverse events of special interest grades 3-5 were arterio-vascular disorders in 9 vs 8\%, fatigue in 2 vs 4\%, thrombocytopenia in 8 vs 8\%, and alanine aminotransferase elevation in 4 vs 9\% of pts in the NIL vs NIL/IFN arms, respectively. QoL analyses revealed the perception of a decreased cognitive function and higher rates of fatigue in pts in the NIL/IFN arm, particularly in pts older than 40 years. In total, 24 pts (NIL, n=13; NIL/IFN, n=11) progressed to advanced disease. By 8 years, progression-free survival was 94\% (95\% CI: 90-96\%) and 92\% (88-95\%), overall survival 95\% (92-97\%) and 94\% (91-97\%) in the NIL and NIL/IFN arms, respectively. 28 pts (3.9\%) received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 14 after disease progression. 35 pts died (NIL, n=18; NIL/IFN, n=17), 9 related to CML. Conclusions: Survival of CML pts has reached probabilities close to normal. The combination of NIL with IFN is associated with a higher rate of molecular responses but also impaired tolerability. IFN maintenance is feasible, and resulted in a trend towards higher rates of long-term TFR. The study was conducted on behalf of the German CML Study Group in cooperation with the East German Study Group on Hematology and Oncology (OSHO) and the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK).},

  abstract = {Iron overload due to red blood cell (RBC) transfusions is associated with morbidity and mortality in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Many studies have suggested improved survival after iron chelation therapy (ICT), but valid data are limited. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of ICT on overall survival and hematologic improvement in lower-risk MDS patients in the European MDS registry. We compared chelated patients with a contemporary, non-chelated control group within the European MDS registry, that met the eligibility criteria for starting iron chelation. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess overall survival (OS), treating receipt of chelation as a time-varying variable. Additionally, chelated and non-chelated patients were compared using a propensity-score matched model. Of 2,200 patients, 224 received iron chelation. The hazard ratio and 95\% confidence interval for OS for chelated patients, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, performance status, cumulative RBC transfusions, Revised-International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), and presence of ringed sideroblasts was 0.50 (0.34-0.74). The propensity-score analysis, matched for age, sex, country, RBC transfusion intensity, ferritin level, comorbidity, performance status, and IPSS-R, and, in addition, corrected for cumulative RBC transfusions and presence of ringed sideroblasts, demonstrated a significantly improved OS for chelated patients with a hazard ratio of 0.42 (0.27-0.63) compared to non-chelated patients. Up to 39\% of chelated patients reached an erythroid response. In conclusion, our results suggest that iron chelation may improve OS and hematopoiesis in transfused lower-risk MDS patients. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifier: 00600860.}

  abstract = {Red blood cell transfusions (RBCT) remain the cornerstone of supportive care in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (LRMDS) [1]. Transfusion dependency in LRMDS patients is associated with inferior outcomes, mainly attributed to severe bone marrow failure [2]. However, iron toxicity, due to frequent RBCT or ineffective erythropoiesis, may be an additional negative prognostic factor [3,4,5,6]. Recently, much progress has been made in unraveling the iron metabolism. The peptide hormone hepcidin is the key regulator by inhibiting iron uptake through degradation of ferroportin, a cellular iron exporter [7]. Erythroferrone and GDF15, produced by erythroblasts, inhibit hepcidin production, which leads to increased uptake and cellular release of iron for the purpose of erythropoiesis [8]. The pathophysiology of iron metabolism in MDS is still not completely understood. Exceedingly high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are associated with iron toxicity, disease development, and progression in MDS patients [9,10,11,12]. Malondialdehyde (MDA), resulting from lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, is a biomarker of oxidative stress [10, 12]. Currently, little is known about the prognostic impact of ROS in MDS patients. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) describe iron and oxidative stress parameters over time in LRMDS patients and (2) to assess their effect on overall and progression-free survival. The EUMDS registry prospectively collects observational data on newly diagnosed LRMDS patients from 148 centers in 16 countries in Europe and Israel as of January 2008. All patients provided informed consent. Clinical data were collected at baseline and at each six-monthly follow-up visit. Serum samples were collected prospectively at each visit from 256 patients included in six participating countries. Conventional iron parameters were measured with routine assays. We additionally analyzed hepcidin, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI), labile plasma iron (LPI), and MDA. Subjects were prospectively followed until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. All iron parameters were measured centrally at the department of Laboratory Medicine of the Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Serum samples were collected just prior to transfusion in transfusion-dependent patients and stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞C. Details on the assays and reference ranges of hepcidin, GDF15, sTfR, NTBI, LPI, and MDA are provided in the supplement. The Spearman rank test was used to evaluate correlations between iron parameters. We stratified the results by transfusion dependency per visit and the presence of ring sideroblasts. When evaluating temporal changes in iron parameters, with linear quantile mixed models, we excluded patients from the timepoint they received iron chelation therapy. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from MDS diagnosis to death or, in case of progression-free survival, to date of progression or death; patients still alive at the end of follow-up were censored. Time-dependent Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves and cox proportional hazards models were used. In total, 256 consecutive patients, were included in this study. Over five six-monthly visits, 1040 samples were collected. Table 1 describes the patient characteristics. Most patients without ring sideroblasts were transfusion-independent at diagnosis (nonRS-TI; 55.9\%), 18.8\% with ring sideroblasts were transfusion-independent (RS-TI), 18.4\% without ring sideroblasts were transfusion-dependent (nonRS-TD), and 7\% with ring sideroblasts were transfusion-dependent patients (RS-TD). The median follow-up time was 6.6 years (95\% CI 5.9‚Äì7.0). LPI was positively correlated with transferrin saturation (TSAT) (r = 0.15, p {$<$} 0.001, Fig. S1). LPI values increased exponentially at TSAT values above 80\%. This effect was most pronounced in the transfusion-dependent groups, but also observed in the RS-TI group. MDA was weakly correlated with NTBI (r = 0.09, p = 0.069) and negatively correlated with hemoglobin level (r = ‚àí0.1, p = 0.033). GDF15 and hepcidin were negatively correlated in the RS-TI and nonRS-TD group and significantly negatively correlated in the RS-TD group (r = ‚àí0.34, p = 0.007, Fig. S2). Serum ferritin levels were elevated in all subgroups with a mean value of 858 ¬µg/L at visit 5. The highest serum ferritin levels were observed in the RS-TD group (mean value at visit 5: 2092 ¬µg/L, Table S1). Serum ferritin increased significantly per visit in the RS-TD group (beta 454.46 ¬µg/L; 95\% CI 334.65‚Äì574.27), but not in the other groups (Table S2). All subgroups, except for the nonRS-TI, had elevated TSAT levels. TSAT levels were most markedly increased in the RS-TD group with a mean TSAT of 88\% at visit 5 (Table S1). In both transfusion-dependent groups the median increase per visit was significant (Table S2). LPI was elevated in the RS-TD group exclusively with a mean value of 0.59 ¬µmol/L at visit 5 (Table S1). NTBI was elevated in all subgroups, with the highest values in the RS-TD group (Table S1). The increase in median NTBI level was significant in both transfusion-dependent groups (Table S2). Hepcidin levels were markedly elevated in the nonRS-TD group. Interestingly, hepcidin levels were lower in the RS-TD group, probably reflecting ineffective erythropoiesis, likewise supported by lower hepcidin/ferritin ratios in RS groups (Table S1). Median hepcidin levels increased over time in the transfusion-dependent subgroups only (Table S2). GDF15 levels, analyzed in the light of its potential role in hepcidin suppression, were increased in all subgroups (Table S1). The RS subgroups had higher GDF15 levels compared to the nonRS groups, reflecting increased erythropoiesis. Mean sTfR levels were within the reference range in all subgroups except for the RS-TI group, which showed elevated levels, reflecting...}

  abstract = {Activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway contributes to the initiation and maintenance of B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. The Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is specifically required for BCR signaling as demonstrated by human and mouse mutations that disrupt Btk function and prevent B-cell maturation at steps that require a functional BCR pathway. Herein we describe a selective and irreversible Btk inhibitor, PCI-32765, that is currently under clinical development in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We have used this inhibitor to investigate the biologic effects of Btk inhibition on mature B-cell function and the progression of B cell-associated diseases in vivo. PCI-32765 blocked BCR signaling in human peripheral B cells at concentrations that did not affect T cell receptor signaling. In mice with collagen-induced arthritis, orally administered PCI-32765 reduced the level of circulating autoantibodies and completely suppressed disease. PCI-32765 also inhibited autoantibody production and the development of kidney disease in the MRL-Fas(lpr) lupus model. Occupancy of the Btk active site by PCI-32765 was monitored in vitro and in vivo using a fluorescent affinity probe for Btk. Active site occupancy of Btk was tightly correlated with the blockade of BCR signaling and in vivo efficacy. Finally, PCI-32765 induced objective clinical responses in dogs with spontaneous B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These findings support Btk inhibition as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of human diseases associated with activation of the BCR pathway.},

  abstract = {Purpose To evaluate randomly the role of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide (hyper-C) dose intensification in adults with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with a pediatric-inspired protocol and to determine the upper age limit for treatment tolerability in this context. Patients and Methods A total of 787 evaluable patients (B/T lineage, 525 and 262, respectively; median age, 36.1 years) were randomly assigned to receive a standard dose of cyclophosphamide or hyper-C during first induction and late intensification. Compliance with chemotherapy was assessed by median doses actually received during each treatment phase by patients potentially exposed to the full planned doses. Results Overall complete remission (CR) rate was 91.9\%. With a median follow-up of 5.2 years, the 5-year rate of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was 52.2\% (95\% CI, 48.5\% to 55.7\%) and 58.5\% (95\% CI, 54.8\% to 61.9\%), respectively. Randomization to the hyper-C arm did not increase the CR rate or prolong EFS or OS. As a result of worse treatment tolerance, advanced age continuously affected CR rate, EFS, and OS, with 55 years as the best age cutoff. At 5 years, EFS was 55.7\% (95\% CI, 51.8\% to 59.4\%) for patients younger than 55 years of age versus 25.8\% (95\% CI, 19.9\% to 35.6\%) in older patients (hazard ratio, 2.16; P {$<$} .001). Patients ‚â• 55 years of age, in whom a lower compliance to the whole planned chemotherapy was observed, benefited significantly from hyper-C, whereas younger patients did not. Conclusion No significant benefit was associated with the introduction of a hyper-C sequence into a frontline pediatric-like adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy.

  abstract = {Purpose               Retrospective comparisons have suggested that adolescents or teenagers with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) benefit from pediatric rather than adult chemotherapy regimens. Thus, the aim of the present phase II study was to test a pediatric-inspired treatment, including intensified doses of nonmyelotoxic drugs, such as prednisone, vincristine, or l-asparaginase, in adult patients with ALL up to the age of 60 years.                                         Patients and Methods               Between 2003 and 2005, 225 adult patients (median age, 31 years; range, 15 to 60 years) with Philadelphia chromosome‚Äìnegative ALL were enrolled onto the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 2003 protocol, which included several pediatric options. Some adult options, such as allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for patients with high-risk ALL, were nevertheless retained. Results were retrospectively compared with the historical France-Belgium Group for Lymphoblastic Acute Leukemia in Adults 94 (LALA-94) trial experience in 712 patients age 15 to 55 years.                                         Results               Complete remission rate was 93.5\%. At 42 months, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 55\% (95\% CI, 48\% to 52\%) and 60\% (95\% CI, 53\% to 66\%), respectively. Age remained an important bad prognostic factor, with 45 years of age as best cutoff. In older versus younger patients, there was a higher cumulative incidence of chemotherapy-related deaths (23\% v 5\%, respectively; P {$<$} .001) and deaths in first CR (22\% v 5\%, respectively; P {$<$} .001), whereas the incidence of relapse remained stable (30\% v 32\%, respectively). Complete remission rate (P = .02), EFS (P {$<$} .001), and OS (P {$<$} .001) compared favorably with the previous LALA-94 experience.                                         Conclusion               These results suggest that pediatric-inspired therapy markedly improves the outcome of adult patients with ALL, at least until the age of 45 years.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients have an inferior prognosis compared to younger patients because available evidence on best treatment is scarce and treatment delivery is challenging due to comorbidities and reduced performance status. High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HCT-ASCT) after high-dose methotrexate (MTX)-based immuno-chemotherapy has become an increasingly used treatment approach in eligible elderly PCNSL patients with promising feasibility and efficacy, but has not been compared with conventional chemotherapy approaches. In addition, eligibility for HCT-ASCT in elderly PCNSL is not well defined. Geriatric assessment (GA) may be helpful in selecting patients for the best individual treatment choice, but no standardized GA exists to date. A randomized controlled trial, incorporating a GA and comparing age-adapted HCT-ASCT treatment with conventional chemotherapy is needed. METHODS: This open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III trial with two parallel arms will recruit 310 patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL\,{$>$}\,65 years of age in 40 centers in Germany and Austria. The primary objective is to demonstrate that intensified chemotherapy followed by consolidating HCT-ASCT is superior to conventional chemotherapy with rituximab, MTX, procarbazine (R-MP) followed by maintenance with procarbazine in terms of progression free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), (neuro-)toxicity and quality of life (QoL). GA will be conducted at specific time points during the course of the study. All patients will be treated with a pre-phase rituximab-MTX (R-MTX)~cycle followed by re-assessment of transplant eligibility. Patients judged transplant eligible will be randomized (1:1). Patients in arm A will be treated with 3 cycles of R-MP followed by maintenance therapy with procarbazine for 6 months. Patients in arm B will be treated with 2 cycles of MARTA (R-MTX/AraC) followed by busulfan- and thiotepa-based HCT-ASCT. DISCUSSION: The best treatment strategy for elderly PCNSL patients remains unknown. Treatments range from palliative to curative but more toxic therapies, and there is no standardized measure to select patients for the right treatment. This randomized controlled trial will create evidence for the best treatment strategy with the focus on developing a standardized GA to help define eligibility for an intensive treatment approach.

These recurrent mutations in key metabolic enzymes lead to the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which promotes leukemogenesis through a block in normal myeloid differentiation. Since this discovery, selective oral inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 have subsequently been developed and are now approved as single agent therapy, based on clinical efficacy observed within the original first-in-human trials.

  abstract = {Summary Background The combination of chemotherapy and ponatinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has the potential to be a new standard of care for the disease; however, long-term efficacy and safety data are needed. Our aim was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of this regimen in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in this ongoing phase 2 trial. Methods In our single-centre, phase 2, single-arm trial in the USA, adult patients with previously untreated Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were sequentially enrolled. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, a left ventricular ejection fraction above 50\%, and adequate hepatic and renal function (serum bilirubin ÔøΩÔøΩ3Áπö0 mg/dL and serum creatinine ÔøΩÔøΩ3Áπö0 mg/dL, unless higher levels were believed to be due to leukaemia at the discretion of the investigator). Patients received eight cycles of 21 days, alternating between two drug combinations: hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) and high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine. Ponatinib was given orally at 45 mg per day for the first 14 days of cycle 1 then continuously at 45 mg per day for the subsequent cycles. After 37 patients were treated, the protocol was amended to reduce the dose of ponatinib to 30 mg per day at cycle 2, with further reduction to 15 mg once a complete molecular response (defined as absence of quantifiable BCR-ABL1 transcripts) was achieved. Patients in complete remission received maintenance with ponatinib daily (30 mg or 15 mg) indefinitely, and with vincristine (2 mg intravenously on day 1) and prednisone (200 mg orally on days 1ÔøΩÔøΩ5) monthly for 2 years. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01424982 , and is ongoing and still enrolling patients. Findings 76 patients with a median age of 47 years (IQR 39ÔøΩÔøΩ61) were enrolled and treated between Nov 19, 2011, and April 4, 2018. The 3-year event-free survival was 70\% (95\% CI 56ÔøΩÔøΩ80). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were infection (n=65, 86\%), increased transaminases (n=24, 32\%), increased bilirubin (n=13, 17\%), pancreatitis (n=13, 17\%), hypertension (n=12, 16\%), bleeding (n=10, 13\%), and skin rash (n=9, 12\%). Six patients died while still on study treatment. Three patients (4\%) died from infection and one (1\%) from haemorrhage. Two patients died from myocardial infarction related to early ponatinib use; neither death occurred after protocol revision. Interpretation The combination of chemotherapy with ponatinib is effective in achieving long-term remission in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positiveÔøΩÔøΩ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This regimen could represent a new standard of care for this population. A randomised, phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy of this combination compared with chemotherapy plus earlier-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is warranted. Funding Takeda Oncology.},

Patients receiving axi-cel in the real world could have broader a demographic, disease, and treatment profile compared with that of the cohort in the pivotal ZUMA-1 trial. The present study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of axi-cel therapy in the real-world setting. A total of 1297 patients receiving commercial axi-cel between 2017 and 2020 were selected from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research's data registry, of whom 739 (57\%) would have been ineligible for inclusion in the ZUMA-1 cohort. Efficacy and safety outcomes were described for the entire cohort and by ZUMA-1 eligibility. Their associations with age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score, and comorbidities were evaluated using multivariable logistic and Cox regressions. At a median follow-up of 12.9 months, the overall response rate (ORR) was 73\%, with a 56\% complete response (CR) rate. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 21.8 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 17.4 to 28.8 months) and 8.6 months (95\% CI, 6.5 to 12.1 months), respectively. Duration of response (DOR) was comparable in the ZUMA-1 ineligible patients and ZUMA-1 eligible patients (62\% by 1 year [95\% CI, 57\% to 66\%] versus 67\% [95\% CI, 62\% to 72\%]). Patients age ‚â•65 years had favorable ORR (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.05 to 1.83) despite having a higher risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (OR, 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.94) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) (OR, 1.77; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.26). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score ‚â•2 was associated with inferior efficacy outcomes (OR for ORR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.18-0.56; hazard ratio [HR] for OS, 3.27; 95\% CI, 2.37 to 4.52) and higher incidence of ICANS (OR, 2.63; 95\% CI, 1.40 to 4.93). The patients ineligible for ZUMA-1 still had a durable response with axi-cel. Elderly patients had favorable efficacy outcomes despite higher rates of CRS and ICANS. Patient selection for standard-of-care axi-cel should consider comorbidities and risk-to-benefit ratio rather than be based strictly on ZUMA-1 eligibility.},

  abstract = {In the past 50 years, we have witnessed explosive growth in the understanding of normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells. B-cell, T-cell, and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms in many respects recapitulate normal stages of lymphoid cell differentiation and function, so that they can be to some extent classified according to the corresponding normal stage. Likewise, the molecular mechanisms involved the pathogenesis of lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias are often based on the physiology of the lymphoid cells, capitalizing on deregulated normal physiology by harnessing the promoters of genes essential for lymphocyte function. The clinical manifestations of lymphomas likewise reflect the normal function of lymphoid cells in vivo. The multiparameter approach to classification adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification has been validated in international studies as being highly reproducible, and enhancing the interpretation of clinical and translational studies. In addition, accurate and precise classification of disease entities facilitates the discovery of the molecular basis of lymphoid neoplasms in the basic science laboratory.},

In the ZUMA-1 trial that led to axi-cel approval, the median time between apheresis and delivery of CAR T cells to the treating facility was 17 days (Neelapu, Locke et al. NEJM 2018). Bridging therapy, defined as lymphoma therapy given between apheresis and the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, was not permitted on ZUMA-1. By contrast, the pivotal JULIET trial for tisa-cel (Schuster et al. NEJM 2019) had a median time from enrollment to infusion of 54 days and 92\% of patients received bridging therapy. Whether bridging therapy affects lymphoma CAR T outcomes is unknown. Here we evaluate patients receiving bridging therapy for axi-cel in a large multicenter cohort.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Methods and Results{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}The US Lymphoma CAR T Consortium includes seventeen US academic centers that contribute data from lymphoma patients treated with standard of care (SOC) CAR T-cell therapy independently of manufacturers. As of 8/31/2018, 300 patients were apheresed with intent to manufacture SOC axi-cel for LBCL. Of the 23 patients that underwent apheresis for axi-cel and did not receive it, 20 had lymphoma progression or death that precluded CAR T infusion, of which 16 received bridging therapy. In this study, we analyze the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population of 276 patients receiving CAR T infusion with a median follow up of 9 months. In this group, 146 (53\%) patients received bridging therapy while 130 (47\%) patients received no bridging therapy. Bridging therapy consisted of steroids alone (n = 35, 24\%), chemotherapy (n = 73, 50\%), radiation (n = 24, 16\%), or targeted therapies (n = 14, 10\%).{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}At baseline, a higher proportion of patients in the bridging therapy group had an ECOG score of 2 - 4 vs. 0 - 1 (bridging 24.8\%, no bridging 6.1\%, p \&amp;lt;0.001), IPI score of 3 -5 vs. 0 - 2 (bridging 67.6\%, no bridging 34.3\%, p \&amp;lt;0.001), bulky disease greater than 10 cm (28.2\% vs. 13.0\%, p = 0.002), immunohistochemical double expression of MYC and BCL2 (42.5\% vs. 24.6\%, p =0.004) and would not have met all the eligibility criteria for ZUMA-1 for reasons other than bridging therapy (48.6\% vs. 30.0\%, p = 0.002).{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}After axi-cel infusion, patients in the bridging group had similar rates of severe (grade 3 or higher) cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (8.2\% vs. 5.3\%, p = 0.34) and ICANS (35.2\% vs. 28.2\%, p = 0.25). However, the rate of ICU admission was higher in the bridging group (41.4\% vs. 22.9\%, p = 0.001) as was median length of hospital stay (15 vs. 14 days, p = 0.02). While data on cytopenias was not collected, use of G-CSF after CAR T therapy was higher in the bridging group (48.2\% vs. 32.1\%, p = 0.006).{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}In terms of outcomes, in multivariate analysis correcting for confounding features, there was no statistically significant difference in overall response rate (p = 0.2), complete response rate (p = 0.19), and progression free survival (p = 0.3) between bridging and no bridging groups; but bridging therapy was associated with significantly poorer overall survival (p = 0.001) and lymphoma specific survival (p = 0.019) (figure 1.). Both death due to lymphoma (33.1\% vs. 13.0\%) and death due to treatment-related mortality (TRM) (6.9\% vs. 1.5\%) were higher in the bridging group (p \&amp;lt;0.001).{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Lymphoma patients receiving bridging therapy had poorer prognostic factors at baseline and after axi-cel infusion experienced decreased lymphoma-specific and overall survival compared with patients with no bridging. This inferior outcome raises the possibility that bridging therapy may identify a sub-group of lymphoma patients with a different biology, or alternatively, bridging therapy may have an effect on the host or the tumor microenvironment that may impact CAR-T efficacy. With or without bridging, 7\% of patients in our series did not receive axi-cel due to lymphoma progression and/or death. In addition, there may have been patients where bridging prevented progression or death prior to axi-cel infusion. Prospective evaluation of different bridging strategies is warranted to determine if any can improve outcomes after axi-cel, and/or if they should be utilized only for patients requiring emergent disease control during the manufacture period.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$} {$<$}jats:p /{$>$} {$<$}jats:sec{$>$} {$<$}jats:title{$>$}Disclosures{$<$}/jats:title{$>$} {$<$}jats:p{$>$}Jain: Kite/Gilead: Consultancy.

The optimal therapeutic approaches to adult patients with ETP-ALL/LBL are poorly characterized. In this study, we compared the outcomes of adults with ETP-ALL/LBL who received treatment on frontline regimens with those of patients with other T-ALL/LBL immunophenotypic subtypes. Patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL/LBL who received frontline chemotherapy between the years 2000 and 2014 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were identified and immunophenotypically categorized into early, thymic, and mature per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification using CD1a and surface CD3 status. Patients with ETP-ALL/LBL were identified on the basis of the following immunophenotypes: CD1a‚àí, CD8‚àí, CD5‚àí (dim), and positivity for 1 or more stem cell or myeloid antigens. A total of 111 patients with T-ALL/LBL (68\% T-ALL; 32\% T-LBL) with adequate immunophenotype data were identified. The median age was 30 years (range, 13-79). There was no difference in the outcomes of patients based on the WHO subtypes. Nineteen patients (17\%) had ETP-ALL/LBL. The complete remission rate /complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery rate in patients with ETP-ALL/LBL was significantly lower than that of non‚ÄìETP-ALL/LBL patients (73\% vs 91\%; P = .03). The median overall survival for patients with ETP-ALL/LBL was 20 months vs not reached for the non‚ÄìETP-ALL/LBL patients (P = .008). ETP-ALL/LBL represents a high-risk disease subtype of adult ALL. Novel treatment strategies are needed to improve treatment outcomes in this T-ALL/LBL subset.},

The establishment of consensus diagnostic criteria for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), alongside the steady use of both tocilizumab and corticosteroids for treatment, have been essential in facilitating the widespread use. Preemptive interventions to prevent more severe toxicities have improved safety, facilitating CAR T-cell therapy in medically frail populations and in those at high risk of severe CRS/ICANS. Nonetheless, the development of persistent or progressive CRS and ICANS remains problematic because it impairs patient outcomes and is challenging to treat. In this case-based discussion, we highlight a series of cases of CRS and/or ICANS refractory to front-line interventions. We discuss our approach to managing refractory toxicities that persist or progress beyond initial tocilizumab or corticosteroid administration, delineate risk factors for severe toxicities, highlight the emerging use of anakinra, and review mitigation strategies and supportive care measures to improve outcomes in patients who develop these refractory toxicities.},

  abstract = {Increasing use of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has unveiled diverse toxicities warranting specific recognition and management. Cytopenias occurring after CAR-T infusion invariably manifest early (\&lt;30 days), commonly are prolonged (30-90 days), and sometimes persist or occur late (\&gt;90 days). Variable etiologies of these cytopenias, some of which remain incompletely understood, create clinical conundrums and uncertainties about optimal management strategies. These cytopenias may cause additional sequelae, decreased quality of life, and increased resource use. Early cytopenias are typically attributed to lymphodepletion chemotherapy, however, infections and hyperinflammatory response such as immune effector cell‚Äìassociated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome may occur. Early and prolonged cytopenias often correlate with severity of cytokine release syndrome or immune effector cell‚Äìassociated neurotoxicity syndrome. Bone marrow biopsy in patients with prolonged or late cytopenias is important to evaluate for primary disease and secondary marrow neoplasm in both pediatric and adult patients. Commonly, cytopenias resolve over time and evidence for effective interventions is often anecdotal. Treatment strategies, which are limited and require tailoring based upon likely underlying etiology, include growth factors, thrombopoietin-receptor agonist, stem cell boost, transfusion support, and abrogation of infection risk. Here we provide our approach, including workup and management strategies, for cytopenias after CAR-T.},

Accurate and timely diagnosis presents numerous challenges.These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), and the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about VWD diagnosis.ASH, ISTH, NHF, and WFH established a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 4 patient representatives and was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The Outcomes and Implementation Research Unit at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) supported the guideline-development process, including performing or updating systematic evidence reviews up to 8 January 2020. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subsequently subject to public comment.The panel agreed on 11 recommendations.Key recommendations of these guidelines include the role of bleeding-assessment tools in the assessment of patients suspected of VWD, diagnostic assays and laboratory cutoffs for type 1 and type 2 VWD, how to approach a type 1 VWD patient with normalized levels over time, and the role of genetic testing vs phenotypic assays for types 2B and 2N. Future critical research priorities are also identified.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important variable affecting outcome in relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's disease (HD) is the potential of conventional salvage chemotherapy to reduce tumor volume before high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation. Currently, the optimal salvage chemotherapy regimen for these patients is unclear. Since dexamethasone/cisplatin/cytarabine (DHAP) given at 3-4 week intervals has been shown to be very effective in patients with relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we evaluated this regimen given at a median of 16-day intervals in patients with relapsed and refractory HD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory HD were treated with two cycles of DHAP [dexamethasone 40 mg intravenously (i.v.) day 1-4, cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) i.v. as 24-h continuous infusion day 1, and cytarabine 2 g/m(2) i.v. 12q day 2]. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was given at a dose of 5 micro g/kg from day 4 until day 13. Patients with partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) after two cycles of DHAP received sequential HDCT. RESULTS: The median age of the 102 patients included was 34 years (range 21-64 years). Forty-two percent of the patients had late relapse, 29\% early relapse, 12\% multiple relapse and 16\% primary progressive/refractory disease. The response rate (RR) after two cycles of DHAP was 89\% (21\% CR, 68\% PR). The RRs for patients with late, early, multiple and progressive HD were 91\%, 93\%, 92\% and 65\%, respectively. Using the chi-square test for independence, remission status (relapsed HD versus progressive HD) and stage at relapse (stage I/II versus stage III/IV) were significant factors for response to DHAP. WHO grade 4 leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the main toxic- ities occurring in 43\% (mean duration 1.1 days, range 0-6) and 48\% (mean duration 1.4 days, range 0-11) of all courses, respectively. Neither severe infections nor treatment-related deaths occurred. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were collected after the first cycle DHAP in eight patients. The hematopoietic progenitors showed a very rapid increase from day 10 with a synchronous and impressive peak on day 12. A mean of 6.1 x 10(6)/kg CD34(+) cells were collected per apheresis. As originally recommended in the protocol, PBSCs were routinely collected during sequential HDCT in the remaining patients. CONCLUSIONS: A brief tumor-reducing program with two cycles of DHAP given in short intervals supported by G-CSF is effective and well-tolerated in patients with relapsed and refractory HD. This regimen can be used to mobilize stem cells and select those patients with chemosensitive relapse who should subsequently be treated with HDCT.},

  abstract = {Platelets play a fundamental role in normal hemostasis, while their inherited or acquired dysfunctions are involved in a variety of bleeding disorders or thrombotic events. Several laboratory methodologies or point-of-care testing methods are currently available for clinical and experimental settings. These methods describe different aspects of platelet function based on platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion, the viscoelastic properties during clot formation, the evaluation of thromboxane metabolism or certain flow cytometry techniques. Platelet aggregometry is applied in different clinical settings as monitoring response to antiplatelet therapies, the assessment of perioperative bleeding risk, the diagnosis of inherited bleeding disorders or in transfusion medicine. The rationale for platelet function-driven antiplatelet therapy was based on the result of several studies on patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where an association between high platelet reactivity despite P2Y12 inhibition and ischemic events as stent thrombosis or cardiovascular death was found. However, recent large scale randomized, controlled trials have consistently failed to demonstrate a benefit of personalised antiplatelet therapy based on platelet function testing.},

  abstract = {Bone marrow biopsy is generally a safe procedure. However, infrequently the procedure is associated with serious injuries that are attributed to inadvertent needle penetration of the iliac bone's inner cortex. An evidence-based approach to needle orientation during iliac crest biopsy does not exist. In our study, the posterior to anterior path of the bone marrow needle from the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) was studied in human cadavers in two orientations: (1) perpendicularly to the coronal plane (the perpendicular approach) and (2) laterally toward the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) (the lateral approach). The biopsy needle was deliberately advanced through the inner ilial cortex in both approaches. Dissections and imaging studies were done to identify the relationship of the penetrating needle to internal structures. Both approaches begin with a perpendicular puncture of the outer cortex at the PSIS. The perpendicular approach proceeds anteriorly whereas in the lateral approach the needle is reoriented toward the ipsilateral ASIS before advancing. The lateral approach caused less damage to neurovascular structures and avoided the sacroiliac joint compared to the perpendicular approach. This procedure is best done in the lateral decubitus position. Proper use of the lateral approach should obviate many of the complications reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT   Background  and purpose: Patients with refractory or relapsed lymphoma diagnosed with bulky disease at relapse or with residual disease post salvage treatment are considered to have dismal outcome, even post autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, due to disease recurrence. To minimize post-transplant relapse risk, involved field radiotherapy either to sites of bulky or localized residual disease has been utilized; however, the ideal timing for irradiation remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of involved field radiotherapy in the early post- transplant period.    Materials and methods  We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 24 autografted patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma who presented with bulky disease at relapse or had a persistent localized residual mass post-salvage treatment and consolidated with involved field irradiation within 4 months after autografting.    Results  No significant toxicity was noticed during the early post-radiotherapy period, while graft function was not impaired. After a median follow-up of 3 years for survivors, 21 patients are alive, 19 of whom are event-free, while 2 patients succumbed to disease recurrence and 1 to treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome. The 3-year overall, lymphoma relapse-free and event-free survival rates were 86\%, 86\% and 82\%, respectively.    Conclusions  Taking into consideration the poor-risk features of the study cohort, early post autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation involved field radiotherapy showed a safe and well-tolerated toxicity profile and demonstrated long-term effective tumor control as reflected in the promising survival rates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) primary refractory to or relapsed within 12 months of first-line therapy are at high risk for poor outcomes with current standard of care, platinum-based salvage immunochemotherapy and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel), an autologous, CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has previously demonstrated efficacy and manageable safety in third-line or later LBCL. In this Article, we report a prespecified interim analysis of liso-cel versus standard of care as second-line treatment for primary refractory or early relapsed (within 12 months after response to initial therapy) LBCL. METHODS: TRANSFORM is a global, phase 3 study, conducted in 47 sites in the USA, Europe, and Japan, comparing liso-cel with standard of care as second-line therapy in patients with primary refractory or early (‚â§12 months) relapsed LBCL. Adults aged 18-75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1 or less, adequate organ function, PET-positive disease per Lugano 2014 criteria, and candidates for autologous HSCT were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of interactive response technology, to liso-cel (100\hphantom{,}√ó\hphantom{,}106 CAR+ T cells intravenously) or standard of care. Standard of care consisted of three cycles of salvage immunochemotherapy delivered intravenously-R-DHAP (rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, two infusions of cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 on day 2, and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1), R-ICE (rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, ifosfamide 5000 mg/m2 on day 2, etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-3, and carboplatin area under the curve 5 [maximum dose of 800 mg] on day 2), or R-GDP (rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1)-followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT in responders. Primary endpoint was event-free survival, with response assessments by an independent review committee per Lugano 2014 criteria. Efficacy was assessed per intention-to-treat (ie, all randomly assigned patients) and safety in patients who received any treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03575351, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Oct 23, 2018, and Dec 8, 2020, 232 patients were screened and 184 were assigned to the liso-cel (n=92) or standard of care (n=92) groups. At the data cutoff for this interim analysis, March 8, 2021, the median follow-up was 6¬∑2 months (IQR 4¬∑4-11¬∑5). Median event-free survival was significantly improved in the liso-cel group (10¬∑1 months [95\% CI 6¬∑1-not reached]) compared with the standard-of-care group (2¬∑3 months [2¬∑2-4¬∑3]; stratified hazard ratio 0¬∑35; 95\% CI 0¬∑23-0¬∑53; stratified Cox proportional hazards model one-sided p{$<$}0¬∑0001). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (74 [80\%] of 92 patients in the liso-cel group vs 46 [51\%] of 91 patients in the standard-of-care group), anaemia (45 [49\%] vs 45 [49\%]), thrombocytopenia (45 [49\%] vs 58 [64\%]), and prolonged cytopenia (40 [43\%] vs three [3\%]). Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurological events, which are associated with CAR T-cell therapy, occurred in one (1\%) and four (4\%) of 92 patients in the liso-cel group, respectively (no grade 4 or 5 events). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 44 (48\%) patients in the liso-cel group and 44 (48\%) in the standard-of-care group. No new liso-cel safety concerns were identified in the second-line setting. There were no treatment-related deaths in the liso-cel group and one treatment-related death due to sepsis in the standard-of-care group. INTERPRETATION: These results support liso-cel as a new second-line treatment recommendation in patients with early relapsed or refractory LBCL. FUNDING: Celgene, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.},

  abstract = {Hodgkin lymphoma is a B-cell malignancy with approximately 85-95\% complete remission rate following frontline therapy; however, relapsed/refractory disease occurs in roughly 10-30\% of patients after treatment. Salvage therapy conventionally relies upon cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. A considerable number of patients experience relapse after transplantation, and further salvage management has included the use of allogeneic transplantation and radiotherapy. In the past decade, novel therapies including, brentuximab vedotin, PD-1 inhibitors, and the incorporation of PET-imaging into management have changed the paradigm of relapsed/refractory disease care. Novel therapies have been investigated in both single and combination regimens with other novel therapies and traditional chemotherapies. There is promising early work into the utility of CD30.CAR-T cell therapy, AFM13, camidanlumab tesirine, novel PD-1 inhibitors, and JAK1/JAK2 inhibition in management. Herein, we will review current salvage therapies in Hodgkin lymphoma and future directions in relapsed/refractory disease management.},

Loss of function mutations in IKZF1, the gene encoding Ikaros, have been implicated in adult and pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). These mutations result in haploinsufficiency of the Ikaros gene in approximately half of the cases. The remaining cases contain more severe or compound mutations that lead to the generation of dominant-negative proteins or complete loss of function. All IKZF1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis. Here we review the current genetic, clinical and mechanistic evidence for the role of Ikaros as a tumor suppressor in B-ALL.},

Germline predisposition is increasingly recognized in MDS presenting at older ages as well. Although each individual genetic disorder is rare, as a group, the genetic MDS disorders account for a significant subset of MDS in children and young adults. Because many patients lack overt syndromic features, genetic testing plays an important role in the diagnostic evaluation. This review provides an overview of syndromes associated with genetic predisposition to MDS, discusses implications for clinical evaluation and management, and explores scientific insights gleaned from the study of MDS predisposition syndromes. The effects of germline genetic context on the selective pressures driving somatic clonal evolution are explored. Elucidation of the molecular and genetic pathways driving clonal evolution may inform surveillance and risk stratification, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.}

While a genetic basis for defining diseases is sought where possible, the classification strives to keep practical worldwide applicability in perspective.

  abstract = {Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a disorder characterized by a clonal proliferation derived from primitive haematopoietic stem cells or progenitor cells. Abnormal differentiation of myeloid cells results in a high level of immature malignant cells and fewer differentiated red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. The disease occurs at all ages, but predominantly occurs in older people ({$>$}60 years of age). AML typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms that are attributable to bone marrow failure and may be fatal within weeks or months when left untreated. The genomic landscape of AML has been determined and genetic instability is infrequent with a relatively small number of driver mutations. Mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation are common and are early events in leukaemogenesis. The subclassification of AML has been dependent on the morphology and cytogenetics of blood and bone marrow cells, but specific mutational analysis is now being incorporated. Improvements in treatment in younger patients over the past 35 years has largely been due to dose escalation and better supportive care. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be used to consolidate remission in those patients who are deemed to be at high risk of relapse. A plethora of new agents ‚Äî including those targeted at specific biochemical pathways and immunotherapeutic approaches ‚Äî are now in trial based on improved understanding of disease pathophysiology. These advances provide good grounds for optimism, although mortality remains high especially in older patients.},

Study subjects received induction treatment that comprised concurrent vincristine, daunorubicin, prednisolone, and nilotinib. After achieving complete hematologic remission (HCR), subjects received either 5 courses of consolidation, followed by 2-year maintenance with nilotinib, or allo-HCT. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed at HCR, and every 3 months thereafter. The molecular responses (MRs) were defined as MR3 for BCR-ABL1/G6PDH ratios ÔøΩÔøΩ10(-3) and MR5 for ratios {$<$}10(-5). Ninety evaluable subjects, ages 17 to 71 years, were enrolled in 17 centers. The HCR rate was 91\%; 57 subjects received allo-HCT. The cumulative MR5 rate was 94\%; the 2-year hematologic relapse-free survival (HRFS) rate was 72\% for 82 subjects that achieved HCR, and the 2-year overall survival rate was 72\%. Subjects that failed to achieve MR3 or MR5 were 9.1 times (P = .004) or 6.3 times (P = .001) more prone to hematologic relapse, respectively, than those that achieved MR3 or MR5. MRD statuses just before allo-HCT and at 3 months after allo-HCT were predictive of 2-year HRFS. Adverse events occurred mainly during induction, and most were reversible with dose reduction or transient interruption of nilotinib. The combination of nilotinib with high-dose cytotoxic drugs was feasible, and it effectively achieved high cumulative complete molecular remission and HRFS rates. The MRD status at early postremission time was predictive of the HRFS. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT00844298.},

  abstract = {Background: Hydroxyurea (HU) is the most commonly used first-line cytoreductive treatment option for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) worldwide. However, increasing evidence on the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-alpha2 (IFNŒ±) is emerging, and optimal first-line treatment is to be established.Aims: To compare the efficacy and safety of HU vs. low-dose IFNŒ± in patients with MPN over five years.Methods: DALIAH (NCT01387763) was a randomized phase III trial of HU vs. IFNŒ± in newly diagnosed or untreated patients with MPN (essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), prefibrotic myelofibrosis (PreMF), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)). Patients \&gt; age 60 were randomized (1:1:1) to HU, IFNŒ±-2a, or IFNŒ±-2b whereas patients ‚â§ age 60 were randomized to IFNŒ±-2a or IFNŒ±-2b. The primary outcome was the JAK2V617F molecular response (MR) rate at 18, 36, and 60 months per 2009 European LeukemiaNetwork (ELN) (ET, PV, PreMF) or 2005 European Myelofibrosis Network (EUMNET) (PMF) criteria. Secondary outcomes included the complete clinicohematologic response (CHR) rate at 12 months. The JAK2V617F allele burden was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on peripheral blood (assay sensitivity: 0.1\%). Primary and secondary outcomes were compared between groups (HU vs. IFNŒ± or HU vs. IFNŒ± \&gt; 60 years) using Fisher's exact test (categorical variables) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (continuous variables). Paired comparisons (within groups) were made using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Serial JAK2V617F measurements were compared by unadjusted mixed-effects linear regression analysis.Results: We included 203 patients (ET: 73 (36\%), PV: 89 (44\%), PreMF: 16 (8\%), and PMF: 25 (12\%)) in the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Baseline characteristics were well balanced except for median age (HU: 68 years vs. IFNŒ±: 59 years, p\&lt;0.0001) ( Table 1). The MR rate by ITT analysis was similar between HU and IFNŒ± (18 months: 19\% vs. 21\%, p=1.00; 36 months: 19\% vs. 26\%, p=0.64; 60 months: 23\% vs. 24\%, p=1.00) (Figure 1A). However, the JAK2V617F allele burden was significantly lower in the IFNŒ± group at month 36 and beyond (Figure 1B) and the absolute median (IQR) change in JAK2V617F allele burden (baseline to 60 months) was greater with IFNŒ± (-20\% (-9;-49) vs. -7\% (3;-15), p=0.0053) (Figure 1C). Two patients (IFNŒ±: n=2) were in complete molecular remission (undetectable JAK2V617F) at 60 months. The CHR rate by ITT analysis was higher with HU at 18 months (58\% vs. 38\%, p=0.03) but similar at all other time points (12 months: 50\% vs. 36\%, p=0.21; 60 months: 24\% vs. 22\%, p=0.83) ( Figure 1D). A post hoc subgroup analysis comparing HU with IFNŒ± \&gt; age 60 showed comparable efficacy results. Among patients remaining on treatment (per-protocol analysis), the MR and CHR rates were superior in the IFNŒ± group compared to the HU group at 36 months and beyond. The MR and CHR rates (HU vs. IFNŒ±) by per-protocol analysis were: MR at 36 months: 23\% vs. 56\%, p=0.01; MR at 48 months: 27\% vs. 59\%, p=0.02; MR at 60 months: 35\% vs. 67\%, p=0.03; CHR at 36 months: 33\% vs. 67\%, p=0.002; CHR at 60 months: 38\% vs. 62\%, p=0.05.Overall treatment discontinuation at 60 months was 60\% (HU: 37\% vs. IFNŒ±: 65\%, p=0.0019). The most common cause of treatment discontinuation was adverse events (HU: 6/38 (16\%); IFNŒ±: 71/165 (43\%)). Adverse events ‚â• grade 3 occurred in 46\% (HU: 58\% vs. IFNŒ±: 45\%, p=0.15). Nineteen major thrombotic events were reported in 16 patients (HU: 4 events in 4 patients; IFNŒ±\&gt;60: 12 events in 10 patients; IFNŒ±‚â§60: 3 events in 2 patients), corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.6 per 100 person-years for HU and 3.4 per 100 person-years for IFNŒ± (IFNŒ±\&gt;60: 6.2; IFNŒ±‚â§60: 1.2). None of the patients transformed into secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Five patients died during follow-up (HU: 2; IFNŒ±: 3).Bone marrow histologic remission rates at 36 and 60 months will be presented at the meeting.Conclusion: ITT analysis detected no significant difference in the MR or CHR rates between HU and IFNŒ± with long-term treatment (5 years) among patients with MPN, reflecting a higher treatment discontinuation rate in the IFNŒ± group (65\%). Thus, using the per-protocol principle, the MR and CHR rates were superior in the IFNŒ± group at 36 months and beyond.},

  abstract = {Hemolysis is a well-recognized but poorly characterized phenomenon in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Its pathobiological basis seems to underpin a nonimmune etiology whose clinical significance has not been adequately characterized. Hemolysis in MDS is often attributed to either ineffective intramedullary erythropoiesis or acquired hemoglobinopathies and red blood cell (RBC) membrane defects. These heterogeneous processes have not been associated with specific genetic subsets of the disease. We aimed to describe the prevalence of hemolysis among patients with MDS, their baseline characteristics, molecular features, and resulting impact on outcomes. We considered baseline serum haptoglobin \&lt;10 mg/dL a surrogate marker for intravascular hemolysis. Among 519 patients, 10\% had hemolysis. The baseline characteristics were similar among both groups. Only 13\% of patients with hemolysis were Coombs-positive, suggesting that hemolysis in MDS is largely not immune-mediated. Inferior survival trends were observed among lower-risk patients with MDS undergoing hemolysis. Decreased response rates to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and higher responses to hypomethylating agents (HMA) were also observed in the hemolysis group. U2AF1 and EZH2 hotspot mutations were more prevalent among those undergoing hemolysis (P~\&lt; .05). U2AF1 mutations were observed in 30\% of patients with hemolysis and occurred almost exclusively at the S34 hotspot. Somatic mutations encoding splicing factors may affect erythrocyte membrane components, biochemical properties, and RBC metabolic function, which underpin the development of atypical clones from erythroid precursors in MDS presenting with hemolysis. Future studies will explore the contribution of altered splicing to the development of acquired hemoglobinopathies.},

  abstract = {Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP; also known as Moschcowitz disease) is characterized by the concomitant occurrence of often severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and a variable degree of ischaemic organ damage, particularly affecting the brain, heart and kidneys. Acute TTP was almost universally fatal until the introduction of plasma therapy, which improved survival from {$<$}10\% to 80‚Äì90\%. However, patients who survive an acute episode are at high risk of relapse and of long-term morbidity. A timely diagnosis is vital but challenging, as TTP shares symptoms and clinical presentation with numerous conditions, including, for example, haemolytic uraemic syndrome and other thrombotic microangiopathies. The underlying pathophysiology is a severe deficiency of the activity of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS13), the protease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimeric strings. Ultra-large vWF strings remain uncleaved after endothelial cell secretion and anchorage, bind to platelets and form microthrombi, leading to the clinical manifestations of TTP. Congenital TTP (Upshaw‚ÄìSchulman syndrome) is the result of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ADAMTS13, whereas acquired TTP is an autoimmune disorder caused by circulating anti‚ÄëADAMTS13 autoantibodies, which inhibit the enzyme or increase its clearance. Consequently, immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids and often rituximab, supplement plasma exchange therapy in patients with acquired TTP.},

  abstract = {Purpose To compare a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) with a myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) before allogeneic transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) within a randomized trial. Patients and Methods Within the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial that compared a busulfan-based RIC with MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 129 patients were enrolled from 18 centers. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and were stratified according to donor, age, and blast count. Results Engraftment was comparable between both groups. The CI of acute graft-versus-host disease II to IV was 32.3\% after RIC and 37.5\% after MAC ( P = .35). The CI of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 61.6\% after RIC and 64.7\% after MAC ( P = .76). The CI of nonrelapse mortality after 1 year was 17\% (95\% CI, 8\% to 26\%) after RIC and 25\% (95\% CI, 15\% to 36\%) after MAC ( P = .29). The CI of relapse at 2 years was 17\% (95\% CI, 8\% to 26\%) after RIC and 15\% (95\% CI, 6\% to 24\%) after MAC ( P = .6), which resulted in a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival of 62\% (95\% CI, 50\% to 74\%) and 76\% (95\% CI, 66\% to 87\%), respectively, after RIC, and 58\% (95\% CI, 46\% to 71\%) and 63\% (95\% CI, 51\% to 75\%), respectively, after MAC ( P = .58 and P = .08, respectively). Conclusion This prospective, randomized trial of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation provides evidence that RIC resulted in at least a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival similar to MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia.}

  abstract = {Lenalidomide is a highly effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)). Here, we demonstrate that lenalidomide induces the ubiquitination of casein kinase 1A1 (CK1Œ±) by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (known as CRL4(CRBN)), resulting in CK1Œ± degradation. CK1Œ± is encoded by a gene within the common deleted region for del(5q) MDS and haploinsufficient expression sensitizes cells to lenalidomide therapy, providing a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic window of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS. We found that mouse cells are resistant to lenalidomide but that changing a single amino acid in mouse Crbn to the corresponding human residue enables lenalidomide-dependent degradation of CK1Œ±. We further demonstrate that minor side chain modifications in thalidomide and a novel analogue, CC-122, can modulate the spectrum of substrates targeted by CRL4(CRBN). These findings have implications for the clinical activity of lenalidomide and related compounds, and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of novel modulators of E3 ubiquitin ligases.}

  abstract = {Type 2B von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by changes in von Willebrand factor (VWF) that enhance binding of VWF to GPIb on platelets. Although this disorder is seemingly well defined because of this single molecular defect, in reality type 2B VWD is a clinically heterogeneous disorder that can be difficult to identify and manage. Diagnostic criteria include a history of mucocutaneous bleeding, laboratory studies showing enhanced VWF binding of platelets and/or a 2B VWD genetic variant, and a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Thrombocytopenia, although not always present, is common and can be exacerbated by physiologic stressors such as pregnancy. The mainstay of therapy for type 2B VWD is VWF replacement therapy. Adjunct therapies useful in other types of VWD, such as antifibrinolytics, are also used in type 2B VWD. 1-Desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) is controversial because of exacerbation of thrombocytopenia, but is, in practice, sometimes used for minor bleeding. Here we review the available evidence and provide 3 clinical cases to illustrate the intricacies of diagnosing type 2B VWD to describe the response to DDAVP and to review complexities and management during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {A hallmark of many types of B-cell lymphoma is reciprocal chromosomal translocations involving one of the immunoglobulin loci and a proto-oncogene. As a consequence of such translocations, the oncogene comes under the control of an active immunoglobulin locus, causing deregulated, constitutive expression of the translocated gene.Normal B cells depend on B-cell receptor (BCR) expression for survival. The selection for expression of a BCR also seems to operate in most malignant B cells.Although there is strong evidence that most B-cell lymphomas depend on BCR expression, there are a few exceptions ‚Äî namely classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, some post-transplant lymphomas, and the rare primary effusion lymphomas.In several lymphomas, there is a strong indication that the lymphoma cells recognize an antigen and that stimulation by antigen binding contributes to the survival and proliferation of lymphoma cells.In many lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, the tumour microenvironment seems to be important for the survival and/or proliferation of the lymphoma cells.The recognition that the survival and/or proliferation of many B-cell lymphomas depends on their interaction with other cells in the microenvironment, as well as on expression of the B-cell receptor and, sometimes, antigen activation, might lead to novel treatment options for B-cell lymphomas.},

  abstract = {The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has revolutionized the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients not benefiting from intensive chemotherapy. Nevertheless, treatment failure remains a challenge, and predictive markers are needed, particularly for relapsed or refractory AML. Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing may correlate with outcomes, but its prospective predictive value remains unexplored. Here we report the results of the first stage of the prospective phase II VenEx trial evaluating the utility and predictiveness of venetoclax sensitivity testing using different cell culture conditions and cell viability assays in patients receiving venetoclax-azacitidine. Participants with de novo AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, relapsed or refractory AML, or secondary AML were included. The primary endpoint was the treatment response in participants showing ex vivo sensitivity and the key secondary endpoints were the correlation of sensitivity with responses and survival. Venetoclax sensitivity testing was successful in 38/39 participants. Experimental conditions significantly influenced the predictive accuracy. Blast-specific venetoclax sensitivity measured in conditioned medium most accurately correlated with treatment outcomes; 88\% of sensitive participants achieved a treatment response. The median survival was significantly longer for participants who were ex vivo-sensitive to venetoclax (14.6 months for venetoclax-sensitive patients vs. 3.5 for venetoclax-insensitive patients, P\&lt;0.001). This analysis illustrates the feasibility of integrating drug-response profiling into clinical practice and demonstrates excellent predictivity.

One hundred ninety-seven eligible and evaluable patients (16 to 80 years of age; median, 32 years of age) received cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase; 167 patients (85\%) achieved a complete remission (CR), 13 (7\%) had refractory disease, and 17 (9\%) died during induction. A higher CR rate was observed in younger patients (94\% for those or = 60 years old, P {$<$} .001) and in those who had a mediastinal mass (100\%) or blasts with a T-cell immunophenotype. Eighty percent of B-lineage and 97\% of T-cell ALL patients achieved a CR (P = .01). The coexpression of myeloid antigens did not affect the response rate or duration. Seventy percent of those with cytogenetic or molecular evidence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and 84\% of those without such evidence achieved a CR (P = .11). Patients in remission received multiagent consolidation treatment, central nervous system prophylaxis, late intensification, and maintenance chemotherapy for a total of 24 months. After a median follow-up time of 43 months, the median survival for all 197 patients is 36 months; the median remission duration for the 167 CR patients is 29 months. Favorable pretreatment characteristics relative to remission duration or survival are younger age, the presence of a mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy, a white blood cell count (WBC) less than 30,000/microL, L1 morphology, T or TMy immunophenotype, and the absence of the Ph chromosome. The estimates of the proportion surviving at 3 years are 69\% for patients less than 30 years old, 39\% for those 30 to 59 years old, 89\% for those who had a mediastinal mass, 59\% with WBC less than 30,000/microL, 63\% with L1 morphology, 69\% for T or TMy antigen expression, and 62\% for those who lack the Ph chromosome. Fifteen patients (8\%) had no unfavorable prognostic factors and have an estimated probability of survival at 5 years of 100\% (95\% confidence interval, 77\% to 100\%). This intensive chemotherapy regimen produces a high remission rate and a high proportion of durable remissions in adults with ALL.},

  abstract = {Racial and ethnic disparities persist in the incidence and treatment outcomes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, there is a paucity of data describing the genetic basis of these disparities, especially in association with modern ALL molecular taxonomy and in the context of contemporary treatment regimens.To evaluate the association of genetic ancestry with childhood ALL molecular subtypes and outcomes of modern ALL therapy.This multinational, multicenter genetic association study was conducted from March 1, 2000, to November 20, 2020, among 2428 children and adolescents with ALL enrolled in frontline trials from the United States, South East Asia (Singapore and Malaysia), and Latin America (Guatemala), representing diverse populations of European, African, Native American, East Asian, and South Asian descent. Statistical analysis was conducted from February 3, 2020, to April 19, 2021.Molecular subtypes of ALL and genetic ancestry were comprehensively characterized by performing RNA sequencing. Associations of genetic ancestries with ALL molecular subtypes and treatment outcomes were then evaluated.Among the participants in the study, 1340 of 2318 (57.8\%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 7.8 (5.3) years. Of 21 ALL subtypes identified, 8 were associated with ancestry. East Asian ancestry was positively associated with the frequency of somatic DUX4 (odds ratio [OR], 1.30 [95\% CI, 1.16-1.45]; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and ZNF384 (OR, 1.40 [95\% CI, 1.18-1.66]; P\,\&lt;\,.001) gene rearrangements and negatively associated with BCR-ABL1‚Äìlike ALL (OR, 0.79 [95\% CI, 0.66-0.92]; P\,=\,.002) and T-cell ALL (OR, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.71-0.90]; P\,\&lt;\,.001). By contrast, occurrence of CRLF2 rearrangements was associated with Native American ancestry (OR, 1.48 [95\% CI, 1.29-1.69]; P\,\&lt;\,.001). When the percentage of Native American ancestry increased, ETV6-RUNX1 fusion became less frequent (OR, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.70-0.91]; P\,\&lt;\,.001), with the opposite trend observed for ETV6-RUNX1‚Äìlike ALL. There was a marked preponderance of T-cell ALL in children of African descent compared with those with a high percentage of Native American ancestry (African: OR, 1.22 [95\% CI, 1.07-1.37]; P\,=\,.003; Native American: OR, 0.53 [95\% CI, 0.40-0.67]; P\,\&lt;\,.001). African ancestry was also positively associated with the prevalence of TCF3-PBX1 (OR, 1.49 [95\% CI, 1.25-1.76]; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and negatively associated with DUX4 rearrangements (OR, 0.70 [95\% CI, 0.48-0.93]; P\,=\,.01) and hyperdiploidy (OR, 0.77 [95\% CI, 0.68-0.86]; P\,\&lt;\,.001). African and Native American ancestries as continuous variables were both associated with poorer event-free survival (for every 25\% increase in ancestry: hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.4; P\,=\,.001 for African ancestry; HR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.6; P\,=\,.04 for Native American ancestry) and overall survival (for every 25\% increase in ancestry: HR, 1.2; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.5; P\,=\,.01 for African ancestry; HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.8; P\,=\,.03 for Native American ancestry). Even after adjusting for biological subtypes and clinical features, Native American and African ancestries remained associated with poor prognosis.This study suggests that ALL molecular subtypes and prognosis are associated with genetic ancestry, potentially pointing to a genetic basis for some of the racial and ethnic disparities in ALL. Therefore, molecular subtype‚Äìdriven treatment individualization is needed to help address racial and ethnic gaps in outcomes.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is rapidly emerging as one of the most promising therapies for hematologic malignancies. Two CAR T products were recently approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment ofpatients up to age 25years with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or adults with large B cell lymphoma. Many more CAR T products, as well as other immunotherapies, including various immune cell- and bi-specific antibody-based approaches that function by activation of immune effector cells, are in clinical development for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. These therapies are associated with unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. The assessment and grading of these toxicities vary considerably across clinical trials and across institutions, making it difficult to compare the safety of different products and hindering the ability to develop optimal strategies for management of these toxicities. Moreover, some aspects of these grading systems can be challenging to implement across centers. Therefore, in an effort to harmonize the definitions and grading systems for CRS and neurotoxicity, experts from all aspects of the field met on June 20 and 21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT) in Arlington, VA. Here we report the consensus recommendations of that group and propose new definitions and grading for CRS and neurotoxicity that are objective, easy to apply, and ultimately more accurately categorize the severity of these toxicities. The goal is to provide a uniform consensus grading system for CRS and neurotoxicity associated with immune effector cell therapies, for use across clinical trials and in the postapproval clinical setting.},

  abstract = {Abstract             As immune-based therapies for cancer become potent, more effective, and more widely available, optimal management of their unique toxicities becomes increasingly important. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially life-threatening toxicity that has been observed following administration of natural and bispecific antibodies and, more recently, following adoptive T-cell therapies for cancer. CRS is associated with elevated circulating levels of several cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon Œ≥, and uncontrolled studies demonstrate that immunosuppression using tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, with or without corticosteroids, can reverse the syndrome. However, because early and aggressive immunosuppression could limit the efficacy of the immunotherapy, current approaches seek to limit administration of immunosuppressive therapy to patients at risk for life-threatening consequences of the syndrome. This report presents a novel system to grade the severity of CRS in individual patients and a treatment algorithm for management of CRS based on severity. The goal of our approach is to maximize the chance for therapeutic benefit from the immunotherapy while minimizing the risk for life threatening complications of CRS.},

At the same time, ongoing consumption of platelets and coagulation proteins results in thrombocytopenia and low concentrations of clotting factors, which may cause profuse hemorrhagic complications. DIC is always secondary to an underlying condition, such as severe infections, solid or hematologic malignancies, trauma, or obstetric calamities. A reliable diagnosis of DIC can be made through simple scoring algorithms based on readily available routine hemostatic parameters. The cornerstone of supportive treatment of this coagulopathy is management of the underlying condition. Additionally, administration of heparin may be useful, and restoration of physiological anticoagulants has been suggested, but has not been proven successful in improving clinically relevant outcomes so far. In patients with major bleeding or at risk for hemorrhagic complications, administration of platelet concentrates, plasma, or coagulation factor concentrates should be considered.},

TCR-T cell therapy is another active field of cellular immunotherapy for cancer. METHODS: We previously developed a human anti-CD19 antibody (ET190L1) and generated novel CD19-specific Œ≥/Œ¥ TCR-T cells, ET019003, by fusing the Fab fragment of ET190L1 with Œ≥/Œ¥ TCR constant chain plus adding an ET190L1-scFv/CD28 co-stimulatory molecule. ET019003 cells were tested in preclinical studies followed by a phase 1 clinical trial. RESULTS: ET019003 cells produced less cytokines but retained comparable antitumor potency than ET190L1-CAR-T cells in vivo and in vitro. In the first-in-human trial, eight patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were treated. CRS of grade 1 was observed in three (37.5\%) patients; ICANS of grade 3 was noted in one (12.5\%) patient. Elevation of serum cytokines after ET019003 infusion was almost modest. With a median follow-up of 34 (range 6-38) months, seven (87.5\%) patients attained clinical responses and six (75\%) achieved complete responses (CR). OS, PFS and DOR at 3~years were 75.0\%, 62.5\%, and 71.4\%, respectively. Notably, patient 1 with primary CNS lymphoma did not experience CRS or ICANS and got an ongoing CR for over 3~years after infusion, with detectable ET019003 cells in CSF. ET019003 showed striking in vivo expansion and persisted in 50\% of patients at 12~months. Three patients received a second infusion, one for consolidation therapy after CR and two for salvage therapy after disease progression, but no response was observed. ET019003 expansion was striking in the first infusion, but poor in the second infusion. CONCLUSIONS: CD19-specific Œ≥/Œ¥ TCR-T cells, ET019003, had a good safety profile and could induce rapid responses and durable CR in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, even primary CNS lymphoma, presenting a novel and potent therapeutic option for these patients.

  abstract = {Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a unique, aggressive hematopoietic disorder of infancy/early childhood caused by excessive proliferation of cells of monocytic and granulocytic lineages. Approximately 90\% of patients carry either somatic or germline mutations of PTPN-11, K-RAS, N-RAS, CBL, or NF1 in their leukemic cells. These genetic aberrations are largely mutually exclusive and activate the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the therapy of choice for most patients with JMML, curing more than 50\% of affected children. We recommend that this option be promptly offered to any child with PTPN-11-, K-RAS-, or NF1-mutated JMML and to the majority of those with N-RAS mutations. Because children with CBL mutations and few of those with N-RAS mutations may have spontaneous resolution of hematologic abnormalities, the decision to proceed to transplantation in these patients must be weighed carefully. Disease recurrence remains the main cause of treatment failure after HSCT. A second allograft is recommended if overt JMML relapse occurs after transplantation. Recently, azacytidine, a hypomethylating agent, was reported to induce hematologic/molecular remissions in some children with JMML, and its role in both reducing leukemia burden before HSCT and in nontransplant settings requires further studies.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Axicabtagene ciloleucel is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. In the previous analysis of the ZUMA-1 registrational study, with a median follow-up of 15Áπö4 months (IQR 13Áπö7ÔøΩÔøΩ17Áπö3), 89 (82\%) of 108 assessable patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel achieved an objective response, and complete responses were noted in 63 (58\%) patients. Here we report long-term activity and safety outcomes of the ZUMA-1 study. Methods ZUMA-1 is a single-arm, multicentre, registrational trial at 22 sites in the USA and Israel. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically confirmed large B-cell lymphomaÔøΩ„ª≥ncluding diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphomaÔøΩ§§óccording to the 2008 WHO Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissue; refractory disease or relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and had previously received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing-regimen and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Participants received one dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel on day 0 at a target dose of 2ÔøΩÔøΩËΩÅÔøΩÔøΩ106 CAR T cells per kg of bodyweight after conditioning chemotherapy with intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m2 body-surface area) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 body-surface area) on days ÔøΩÔøΩ5, ÔøΩÔøΩ4, and ÔøΩÔøΩ3. The primary endpoints were safety for phase 1 and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response for phase 2, and key secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response. Pre-planned activity and safety analyses were done per protocol. ZUMA-1 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT02348216 . Although the registrational cohorts are closed, the trial remains open, and recruitment to extension cohorts with alternative endpoints is underway. Findings Between May 19, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 119 patients were enrolled and 108 received axicabtagene ciloleucel across phases 1 and 2. As of the cutoff date of Aug 11, 2018, 101 patients assessable for activity in phase 2 were followed up for a median of 27Áπö1 months (IQR 25Áπö7ÔøΩÔøΩ28Áπö8), 84 (83\%) had an objective response, and 59 (58\%) had a complete response. The median duration of response was 11Áπö1 months (4Áπö2ÔøΩÂøõot estimable). The median overall survival was not reached (12Áπö8ÔøΩÂøõot estimable), and the median progression-free survival was 5Áπö9 months (95\% CI 3Áπö3ÔøΩÔøΩ15Áπö0). 52 (48\%) of 108 patients assessable for safety in phases 1 and 2 had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events. Grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome occurred in 12 (11\%) patients, and grade 3 or worse neurological events in 35 (32\%). Since the previous analysis at 1 year, additional serious adverse events were reported in four patients (grade 3 mental status changes, grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome, grade 3 lung infection, and two episodes of grade 3 bacteraemia), none of which were judged to be treatment related. Two treatment-related deaths (due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest) were previously reported, but no new treatment-related deaths occurred during the additional follow-up. Interpretation These 2-year follow-up data from ZUMA-1 suggest that axicabtagene ciloleucel can induce durable responses and a median overall survival of greater than 2 years, and has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

The use of radiation therapy as a component of combined-modality treatment in this setting is controversial. In this review, we describe the data in support of and against the use of radiation therapy for stage III and IV Hodgkin lymphoma. Specifically, we review the data for the use of radiation therapy in the consolidation and partial-response settings, including for patients with initial bulky disease. We also discuss the use of radiation therapy in the era of more modern systemic therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and brentuximab vedotin.},

From 1997 to 2018, we identified 307 adults (‚â•18 years old) and 9 children (209 males, 107 females; P~\&lt; .001) with both an HLH-related diagnosis and malignant disease, corresponding to 0.19 per 100\,000 adults annually (0.15/100\,000 for the entire population), increasing from 0.026 (1997-2007) to 0.34 (2008-2018) (P~\&lt; .001). In the latest 7-year period (2012-2018), the annual incidence was 0.45 per 100\,000 adults (n~= 246). This incidence varied between the 6 health care regions in Sweden, from 0.18 to 0.71 (Region Stockholm) per 100\,000 adults annually (P~\&lt; .001), likely due to variable awareness. Mal-HLH was reported in 0.6\% of all hematological malignancies, with the highest proportion (2.5\%) in young males. Among the 316 patients, the 1-month probability of survival, likely representing the HLH episode, increased significantly from 52\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 40-63) (1997-2007) to 71\% (95\% CI, 65-76) (2008-2018), whereas 2-year survival remained poor (25\%; 95\% CI, 20-30). Altogether, 52\% were lymphomas, 29\% leukemias, 8\% other hematological malignancies, and 11\% solid tumors. Males were more affected than females by mal-HLH, also taking the over-representation of males with hematological malignancies into account (P~= .0012). Validation by medical-file reviews revealed 13\% over-reporting of HLH. We conclude that the annual mal-HLH incidence has increased 10-fold and was at least 0.71 per 100\,000 adults from 2012 to 2018, that is, 0.62 per 100\,000 adults considering 13\% estimated HLH over-reporting, and that early survival improved significantly, likely due to increased awareness and more HLH-directed therapy.},

The initial phase of this ongoing multicenter, community-based, open-label study evaluated three alternative AZA dosing schedules without weekend dosing. Patients and Methods MDS patients were randomly assigned to one of three regimens every 4 weeks for six cycles: AZA 5-2-2 (75 mg/m 2 /d subcutaneously for 5 days, followed by 2 days no treatment, then 75 mg/m 2 /d for 2 days); AZA 5-2-5 (50 mg/m 2 /d subcutaneously for 5 days, followed by 2 days no treatment, then 50 mg/m 2 /d for 5 days); or AZA 5 (75 mg/m 2 /d subcutaneously for 5 days). Results Of patients randomly assigned to AZA 5-2-2 (n 50), AZA 5-2-5 (n 51), or AZA 5 (n 50), most were French-American-British (FAB) lower risk (refractory anemia [RA]/RA with ringed sideroblasts/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with 5\% bone marrow blasts, 63\%) or RA with excess blasts (30\%), and 79 (52\%) completed six treatment cycles. Hematologic improvement (HI) was achieved by 44\% (22 of 50), 45\% (23 of 51), and 56\% (28 of 50) of AZA 5-2-2, AZA 5-2-5, and AZA 5 arms, respectively. Proportions of RBC transfusion‚Äì dependent patients who achieved transfusion independence were 50\% (12 of 24), 55\% (12 of 22), and 64\% (16 of 25), and of FAB lower-risk transfusion-dependent patients were 53\% (nine of 17), 50\% (six of 12), and 61\% (11 of 18), respectively. In the AZA 5-2-2, AZA 5-2-5, and AZA 5 groups, 84\%, 77\%, and 58\%, respectively, experienced 1 grade 3 to 4 adverse events. Conclusion All three alternative dosing regimens produced HI, RBC transfusion independence, and safety responses consistent with the currently approved AZA regimen. These results support AZA benefits in transfusion-dependent lower-risk MDS patients.}

  abstract = {Given that there are only a few prospective studies with conflicting results, we investigated the prognostic value of multiparameter geriatric assessment (GA) domains on tolerance and outcomes after intensive chemotherapy in older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In all, 105 newly diagnosed patients with AML who were older than age~60 years and who received intensive chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine and idarubicin were enrolled prospectively. Pretreatment GA included evaluations for social and nutritional support, cognition, depression, distress, and physical function. The median age was 64 years (range, 60-75 years), and 93\% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score \&lt;2. Between 32.4\% and 69.5\% of patients met the criteria for impairment for each domain of GA. Physical impairment by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and cognitive dysfunction by the Mini-Mental State Examination in the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (CERAD) Assessment Packet (MMSE-KC) were significantly associated with nonfatal toxicities, including grade 3 to 4 infections (SPPB, P = .024; MMSE-KC, P = .044), acute renal failure (SPPB, P = .013), and/or prolonged hospitalization (‚â•40 days) during induction chemotherapy (MMSE-KC, P = .005). Reduced physical function by SPPB and depressive symptoms by the Korean version of the short form of geriatric depression scales (SGDS-K) were significantly associated with inferior survival (SPPB, P = .027; SGDS-K, P = .048). Gait speed and sit-and-stand speed were the most powerful measurements for predicting survival outcomes. Notably, the addition of SPPB and SGDS-K, gait speed and SGDS-K, or sit-and-stand speed and SGDS-K significantly improved the power of existing survival prediction models. In conclusion, GA improved risk stratification for treatment decisions and may inform interventions to improve outcomes for older adults with AML.

To identify, at the submicroscopic level, oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed an investigation of genomic copy number alterations using single nucleotide polymorphism array, genomic polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of candidate genes. Patients and Methods Eighty-three patients with de novo adult Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) ÔøΩ¢ñØositive ALL were enrolled onto institutional (n 17) or Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dellÔøΩÁ¶ëdulto Working Party delle Leucemia Acute (n 66) clinical trials. Treatments included tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) alone, conventional chemotherapy, or a combination of TKI and chemotherapy. Results A 7p12 deletion of IKZF1 (Ikaros) was identified in 52 (63\%) of 83 patients. The pattern of deletion varied among different patients, but the two most common deletion types were loss of exons 4 to 7 in 31 (37\%) of 83 patients and loss of exons 2 to 7 in 17 (20\%) of 83 patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10 v 32 months, respectively; P .02). Furthermore, a significantly shorter cumulative incidence of relapse was recorded in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10.1 v 56.1 months, respectively; P .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the negative prognostic impact of IKZF1 deletion on DFS (P .04). Conclusion We conclude that IKZF1 deletions are likely to be a genomic alteration that significantly affects the prognosis of Ph-positive ALL in adults.},

However, prognosis for old or unfit patients remains poor. In the INCB84344-201 (formerly GIMEMA LAL 1811) prospective, multicenter, phase 2 trial, we tested the efficacy and safety of ponatinib plus prednisone in newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL aged ÔøΩÔøΩ60 years, or unfit for intensive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Forty-four patients received oral ponatinib 45 mg/day for 48 weeks (core phase), with prednisone tapered to 60 mg/m2/day from days -14 to 29. Prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was administered monthly. Median age was 66.5 years (range, 26-85). The primary endpoint (complete hematologic response [CHR] at 24 weeks) was reached in 38/44 patients (86.4\%); complete molecular response (CMR) was reached in 18/44 patients (40.9\%) at 24 weeks. 61.4\% of patients completed the core phase. As of April 24, 2020, median event-free survival was 14.31 months (95\% CI 9.30, 22.31). Median overall survival and duration of CHR were not reached; median duration of CMR was 11.6 months. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were rash (36.4\%), asthenia (22.7\%), alanine transaminase increased (15.9\%), erythema (15.9\%), and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (15.9\%). Cardiac and vascular TEAEs occurred in 29.5\% (grade ÔøΩÔøΩ3, 18.2\%) and 27.3\% (grade ÔøΩÔøΩ3, 15.9\%) of patients, respectively. Dose reductions/interruptions/discontinuations due to TEAEs occurred in 43.2\%/43.2\%/27.3\% of patients; 5 patients had fatal TEAEs.

In multivariate analysis, the 3-year relapse rate was significantly increased after RIC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.2-2.2; P = .001), but the 3-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was decreased in the RIC group (HR, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.41-0.91; P = .015). The 3-year probabilities of progression-free and overall survivals were similar in both groups (39\% after SMC vs 33\% in RIC; multivariate P = .9; and 45\% vs 41\%, respectively; P = .8). In conclusion, the lower 3-year NRM after RIC is encouraging, since these patients were older (age {$>$} 50 years in 73\% RIC vs 28\% in SMC, P {$<$} .001) and had more adverse pretransplantation variables. However, based on the higher risk of relapse, patients with no contraindications for SMC should not receive RIC outside of prospective randomized trials, which are needed to establish the position of RIC-based transplantation in the treatment of patients with MDS.}

  abstract = {The Philadelphia chromosome is the most common cytogenetic abnormality found in adult patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The result of this abnormality is the BCR-ABL protein, a constitutively active kinase involved in cell signaling and survival. When managed with multiagent chemotherapy regimens alone, patients have traditionally had an inferior outcome in terms of remission duration and overall survival when compared with patients who are Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩÂøõegative. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and dasatinib, directly inhibit the BCR-ABL kinase, offering a targeted approach as a therapeutic option. As a result of several clinical trials with adequate follow-up, imatinib combined with chemotherapy represents the current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has previously been the only modality to offer the potential for a cure, and it still should be considered for all patients deemed able to tolerate such an intervention. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib, may further improve the outcome in these patients. The role of molecular monitoring and the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors after stem cell transplantation are areas of active investigation, and the results of ongoing trials will help to clarify the optimal management of these patients.},

Reasons for discontinuation in clinical practice have not been adequately studied. We conducted a retrospective analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with ibrutinib either commercially or on clinical trials. We aimed to compare the type and frequency of toxicities reported in either setting, assess discontinuation rates, and evaluate outcomes. This multicenter, retrospective analysis included ibrutinib-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients at nine United States cancer centers or from the Connect¬Æ Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Registry. We examined demographics, dosing, discontinuation rates and reasons, toxicities, and outcomes. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Six hundred sixteen ibrutinib-treated patients were identified. A total of 546 (88\%) patients were treated with the commercial drug. Clinical trial patients were younger (mean age 58 versus 61 years, P=0.01) and had a similar time from diagnosis to treatment with ibrutinib (mean 85 versus 87 months, P=0.8). With a median follow-up of 17 months, an estimated 41\% of patients discontinued ibrutinib (median time to ibrutinib discontinuation was 7 months). Notably, ibrutinib toxicity was the most common reason for discontinuation in all settings. The median progression-free survival and overall survival for the entire cohort were 35 months and not reached (median follow-up 17 months), respectively. In the largest reported series on ibrutinib- treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we show that 41\% of patients discontinued ibrutinib. Intolerance as opposed to chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression was the most common reason for discontinuation. Outcomes remain excellent and were not affected by line of therapy or whether patients were treated on clinical studies or commercially. These data strongly argue in favor of finding strategies to minimize ibrutinib intolerance so that efficacy can be further maximized. Future clinical trials should consider time-limited therapy approaches, particularly in patients achieving a complete response, in order to minimize ibrutinib exposure.},

To assess treatment effects in the treated (full analysis set [FAS]) and enrolled (intention-to-treat [ITT]) study populations, the JULIET FAS vs the CORAL follow-up FAS and JULIET ITT vs CORAL follow-up ITT populations were separately compared. Propensity score weighting using standardized mortality ratio weight (SMRW) and fine stratification weight (FSW) was used to compare OS and ORR, adjusting for baseline confounders. The results indicated that tisagenlecleucel was associated with a lower hazard of death among the FAS (adjusted hazard ratio [95\% confidence interval], both FSW and SMRW, 0.44 [0.32, 0.59]) and ITT populations (FSW, 0.60 [0.44, 0.77]; SMRW, 0.57 [0.44, 0.73]; all, P {$<$} .001). Median OS was 12.48 months (JULIET) vs 4.34 to 4.40 months (CORAL) for the FAS, and 8.25 (JULIET) months vs 4.04 to 4.86 (CORAL) months for the ITT populations. Tisagenlecleucel was associated with a significantly higher ORR compared with historical treatments among the FAS (adjusted response rate difference [95\% confidence interval], both FSW and SMRW, 36\% [22\%, 0.48\%]; P {$<$} .001) and among the ITT populations after SMRW adjustment (11\% [0\%, 22\%]; P = .043).

  abstract = {Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is often used as consolidation for several subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in first remission. However, many patients relapse after ASCT and have a very poor prognosis. There are no approved treatment options for post-transplant maintenance or consolidation in PTCL. PD-1 blockade has demonstrated some efficacy for patients with PTCL. We therefore conducted a phase 2 multicenter study of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab after ASCT in patients with PTCL in first remission. Pembrolizumab was administered at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles within 21 days from post-ASCT discharge (and within 60 days of stem cell infusion). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 18 months post-ASCT. Twenty-one patients were treated on this study and (14) 67\% completed 8 cycles of treatment. Among all evaluable patients, 13/21 were alive and progression-free at 18-months post-ASCT, meeting the study's primary endpoint. The estimated 18-month PFS was 83.6\% (95\% CI: 68 - 100), and OS 94.4\% (95\% CI: 84 - 100). The toxicity profile was consistent with the known toxicity profile of pembrolizumab with no grade 5 toxicities. In conclusion, PD-1 blockade after ASCT with pembrolizumab is feasible with a favorable safety profile and promising activity, supporting further confirmatory studies. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02362997).},

  abstract = {The addition of high-dose cytarabine to rituximab/bendamustine (RB) induction could improve outcomes for transplant-eligible patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We conducted a pooled analysis of 2 phase 2 trials and an off-trial cohort each testing 3 cycles of RB and 3 cycles of rituximab/high-dose cytarabine (RC) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) among untreated, transplant-eligible patients with MCL. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) led separate phase 2 trials testing sequential and alternating cycles of RB/RC, respectively. Patients treated at DFCI with sequential RB/RC off trial were retrospectively identified. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed in the DFCI trial. A total of 88 patients (23 DFCI trial, 18 WUSTL trial, and 47 off trial) received RB/RC; 92\% of patients completed induction, and 84\% underwent planned consolidative ASCT. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events among trial patients included lymphopenia (88\%), thrombocytopenia (85\%), neutropenia (83\%), and febrile neutropenia (15\%). There were no treatment-related deaths during induction and 2 following ASCT. Among 87 response-evaluable patients, the end-of-induction overall and complete response rates were 97\% and 90\%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 33 months, 3-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 83\% and 92\%, respectively. Patients undergoing MRD testing experienced prolonged MRD negativity after ASCT with emergence of MRD occurring in only 1 patient who subsequently relapsed. RB/RC followed by ASCT achieves high rates of durable remissions in transplant-eligible patients with MCL. These trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT01661881 (DFCI trial) and \#NCT02728531 (WUSTL trial).},

MDS is among the most common of the haematological cancers and its incidence markedly increases with age. Currently available treatments have limited success, with {$<$}5\% of patients undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation, a procedure that offers the only possible cure. Critical contributions of the bone marrow microenvironment to the MDS have recently been investigated. Although the better understanding of the underlying biology, particularly genetics of haematopoietic stem cells, has led to better disease and risk classification; however, the role that the bone marrow microenvironment plays in the development of MDS remains largely unclear. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in understanding the aetiology of MDS, particularly focussing on understanding how HSCs and the surrounding immune/non-immune bone marrow niche interacts together.}

The JAK2V617F variant allele frequency (VAF) is a key determinant of outcomes in PV, including thrombosis and myelofibrotic progression. Here, we critically review the dynamic role of JAK2V617F mutation burden in the pathogenesis and natural history of PV, the suitability of JAK2V617F VAF as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, and the utility of JAK2V617F VAF reduction in PV treatment.},

PIs (ie, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, and BCL2 inhibitors) are revolutionizing the treatment of CLL. PIs have proved to be more effective than CIT, both as upfront therapy and for relapsed/refractory disease, largely because they may overcome the negative impact of adverse biomarkers (eg, TP53 aberrations, unmutated IGHV) on outcomes and because of their acceptable toxicity.

The phase 3 RESONATE study showed improved efficacy of single-agent ibrutinib over ofatumumab in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL, including those with high-risk features. Here we report the final analysis from RESONATE with median follow-up on study of 65.3\,months (range, 0.3-71.6) in the ibrutinib arm. Median progression-free survival (PFS) remained significantly longer for patients randomized to ibrutinib vs ofatumumab (44.1 vs 8.1\,months; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.148; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.113-0.196; PÀÇ.001). The PFS benefit with ibrutinib vs ofatumumab was preserved in the genomic high-risk population with del(17p), TP53 mutation, del(11q), and/or unmutated IGHV status (median PFS 44.1 vs 8.0\,months; HR: 0.110; 95\% CI: 0.080-0.152), which represented 82\% of patients. Overall response rate with ibrutinib was 91\% (complete response/complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, 11\%). Overall survival, censored for crossover, was better with ibrutinib than ofatumumab (HR: 0.639; 95\% CI: 0.418-0.975). With up to 71\,months (median 41\,months) of ibrutinib therapy, the safety profile remained consistent with prior reports; cumulatively, all-grade (grade\,‚â•3) hypertension and atrial fibrillation occurred in 21\% (9\%) and 12\% (6\%) of patients, respectively. Only 16\% discontinued ibrutinib because of adverse events (AEs). These long-term results confirm the robust efficacy of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL irrespective of high-risk clinical or genomic features, with no unexpected AEs.

In everyday clinical practice, haematologists involved in CAR T cell treatment of patients with R/R DLBCL have to deal with diagnostically complex cases and difficult therapeutic choices. The availability of novel immunotherapeutic agents for R/R DLBCL and recent advances in understanding CAR T-cell failure mechanisms demand a rational approach to identify the best choice for bridging therapy and managing post-CAR T-cell therapy relapses. Moreover, positron emission tomography/computerised tomography may result in false-positive interpretation, highlighting the importance of post-treatment biopsy. In this review, we discuss all above issues, presenting four instructive cases, with the aim to provide criteria and new perspectives for CAR T-cell treatment of DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent advances in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have improved patient survival and quality of life (QOL), while reducing transfusion burden. However, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), widely used in younger MDS patients, remains the only curative therapy for MDS. While transplantation outcomes among selected older patients with MDS are similar to younger patients with MDS, early transplantation for older patients is infrequently offered since the relative benefits of HCT over non-HCT therapy in have not been well defined in this patient group. We conducted a multi-center, biologic assignment trial in older individuals with high risk MDS to define the benefit of HCT over non-HCT therapy.Methods: The study was a multicenter, biologic assignment trial in subjects aged 50-75 with higher risk de novo MDS (IPSS Intermediate-2 (Int-2) or High) who were candidates for reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT, comparing outcomes of those with a suitable 8/8 HLA-matched donor to those without a donor. The trial was conducted by the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN 1102, NCT02016781). Eligible subjects were enrolled prior to a formal donor search, and before or after MDS treatment was initiated. Biological assignment to the Donor or No Donor arm was based on high-resolution HLA typing of eligible family members and a search of the unrelated donor registries. Subjects were initially assigned to the No Donor arm and re-assigned to the Donor arm when a suitable donor was identified. Subjects who died or whose 90-day donor search ended without identifying a suitable donor remained in the No Donor arm. Subjects in the Donor arm were expected to undergo RIC HCT within 6 months of enrollment. Subjects underwent RIC HCT or non-HCT therapy according to institutional standards. The primary analysis compared three-year overall survival (OS) between arms using adjusted survival estimates to account for the potential bias resulting from biological assignment. The sample size was selected to provide at least 80\% power to detect a difference of 15\% in 3-year OS. Between January 2014 and November 2018, 384 subjects (Donor n=260, No Donor n=124) were enrolled at 34 centers. The study arms were well balanced for age, gender, KPS, IPSS risk, MDS disease duration and responsiveness to hypomethylating therapy (Table). The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 34.2 months (range: 2.3-38 months) in the Donor arm and 26.9 months (range: 2.4-37.2 months) in the No Donor arm.Results: In an intent-to-treat analysis, adjusted OS at 3 years from study enrollment in the Donor arm was 47.9\% (95\% CI: 41.3\%-54.1\%) compared with 26.6\% (95\% CI: 18.4\%-35.6\%) in the No Donor arm (p=0.0001, absolute difference 21.3\%, 95\% CI: 10.2\%-31.8\%)(Figure). A sensitivity analysis excluding subjects assigned to the No Donor arm who died or withdrew prior to the end of the 90-day search window showed no effect on outcome (Adjusted OS: 48.0\% vs. 28.1\%, p=0.0004). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 3 years was greater in the Donor arm (35.8\%, 95\% CI: 29.8\%-41.8\%) compared with the No Donor arm (20.6\%, 95\% CI: 13.3\%-29.1\%, p=0.003), with no changes in the sensitivity analysis. An OS and LFS benefit was seen across all subgroups tested (Figure).There were no clinically significant differences in QOL between Donor and No Donor arms as measured by the FACT-G, the MOS-SF36 Physical and Mental Component Scores and the EQ-5D utility score at all time points.The overall non-compliance rate for the trial was 26.3\%. Reasons for non-compliance included the use of myeloablative conditioning or failure to proceed to RIC transplant in the Donor arm, and the use of alternative donors in the No Donor arm. In an as-treated analysis, comparison of the HCT and No HCT arms demonstrated a significant advantage in 3-year OS (47.4\% vs. 16.0\%, p\&lt;0.0001) and LFS (39.3\% vs. 10.9\%, p\&lt;0.0001) for subjects who underwent HCT.Conclusions: We observed a significant OS advantage in older patients with Int-2 and High IPSS risk de novo MDS who are RIC HCT candidates and have an HLA-matched donor, when compared with those without a donor. The benefit of having a matched donor was seen across subgroups, including those who were of Medicare age (\&gt;65) and below. HCT should be offered to all individuals between the ages of 50-75 with Int-2 and High IPSS risk MDS in whom a suitable donor can be identified.TableNakamura:Magenta Therapeutics: Other: Advisory board meeting; Kyowa-Kirin: Other: Support on a meeting presentation; Alexion: Other: Support on a meeting presentation; Merck: Other: advisory board meeting; NapaJen Pharma: Consultancy; Kadmon Corporation: Other: Advisory board meeting; Celgene: Other: Support on seminar; Viracor: Consultancy.

The purpose of our study is to elucidate the effect of gene mutations on hematological response and overall survival (OS), particularly focusing on their posttreatment clone size. We enrolled a total of 449 patients with MDS or related myeloid neoplasms. They were analyzed for gene mutations in pretreatment (n~= 449) and posttreatment (n~= 289) bone marrow samples using targeted-capture sequencing to assess the impact of gene mutations and their posttreatment clone size on treatment outcomes. In Cox proportional hazard modeling, multihit TP53 mutation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-2.91; P~{$<$} .001), EZH2 mutation (HR, 1.71; 95\%~CI, 1.14-2.54; P~= .009), and DDX41 mutation (HR, 0.33; 95\%~CI, 0.17-0.62; P~{$<$} .001), together with age, high-risk karyotypes, low platelets, and high blast counts, independently predicted OS. Posttreatment clone size accounting for all drivers significantly correlated with International Working Group (IWG) response (P~{$<$} .001, using trend test), except for that of DDX41-mutated clones, which did not predict IWG response. Combined, IWG response and posttreatment clone size further improved the prediction of the original model and even that of a recently proposed molecular prediction model, the molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M; c-index, 0.653 vs 0.688; P~{$<$} .001, using likelihood ratio test). In conclusion, evaluation of posttreatment clone size, together with the pretreatment mutational profile as well as the IWG response play a role in better prognostication of azacitidine-treated patients with myelodysplasia.}

In vitro marrow culture data have indicated that granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) synergizes with erythropoietin (EPO) for the production of erythroid precursors. In an effort to treat the anemia and neutropenia in this disorder, MDS patients were treated with a combination of recombinant human EPO and recombinant human G-CSF. Fifty-five patients were enrolled in the study of which 53 (96\%) had a neutrophil response. Forty-four patients were evaluable for an erythroid response of which 21 (48\%) responded. An erythroid response was significantly more likely in those patients with relatively low serum EPO levels, higher absolute basal reticulocyte counts and normal cytogenetics at study entry. Seventeen (81\%) of the patients who responded to combined G-CSF plus EPO therapy continued to respond during an 8-week maintenance phase. G-CSF was then discontinued and all patients' neutrophil responses were diminished, whereas 8 continued to have an erythroid response to EPO alone. In 7 of the remaining 9 patients, resumption of G-CSF was required for recurrent erythroid responses. The median duration of erythroid responses to these cytokines was 11 months, with 6 patients having relatively prolonged and durable responses for 15 to 36 months. Our results also indicate that approximately one half of responding patients require both G-CSF and EPO to maintain an effective erythroid response, suggesting that synergy between G-CSF and EPO exists in vivo for the production of red blood cells in MDS.}

  abstract = {Introduction: The prevention ofdisease transformation which typically occurs during the first years of treatment, is one of the critical goals of the treatment of CP-CML with TKI. In addition, treatment free remission (TFR) represents now another major challenge. In vitro data show that ponatinib is one of the most powerful inhibitors of wild-type as well as mutated BCR::ABL1 TK and this has been translated in heavily pre-treated CML patients (pts) intolerant or resistant to other compounds. In this trial we assessed the safety and efficacy of a 6-months debulking strategy using ponatinib as front-line therapy in newly diagnosed CP-CML, followed by a maintenance with imatinib, in order to bring a high proportion of pts in TFR.Methods: This open-label phase II national academic trial (Clinical Trial: NCT04070443) enrolled newly diagnosed adult CP-CML pts ‚â§65 years, with a major BCR::ABL1 transcript and no significant underlying cardio-vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes with target organ damage, QTc prolongation and with adequate organ functions. They were stratified according to the ELTS score. The primary endpoint is the impact of ponatinib induction on the rate of pts reaching TFR criteria as defined by our group (Rea et al. Cancer, 2018) at M36. Secondary endpoints were the safety and clinical activity of this strategy, ponatinib pharmacokinetics (PK), QoL under both inhibitors and compliance. Pts were treated with ponatinib 30 mg QD for 6-months, followed by imatinib 400 mg QD until TFR criteria (i. e. MR4.5 ‚â•2 years) would been reached before M60. All molecular assessments were centralised and BCR::ABL1 transcripts were expressed in \% on the international scale (IS). This analysis relies on the intention-to-treat principle.Results: One hundred and seventy-eight pts were screened, 170 enrolled and 169 treated between November 2019 and October 2022. Median age was 48 (18-65) years, 113 pts were males (67\%). One pt had a cryptic Ph, and 15 (9\%) pts harboured additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACA). Eighty-four (51.5\%) pts had b2a2 and 99 (61\%) b3a2 transcripts knowing that they could harbour both. ELTS were low for 67 (40\%) pts, intermediate for 73 (44\%) and high for 27 (16\%). For 2 patients it could not be calculated (1 splenectomy, 1 no spleen assessment). European Society of Cardiology (ESC) score was \&lt;2\% in 158/167 (93\%) evaluable pts, 3-9\% in 8 (5\%) pts and \&gt;10\% in 1 (2\%) pt. One hundred and one (60\%) pts never smoked, 46 (27\%) were past smokers. The median follow-up at database lock was 18 (3-33) months. Only induction data are presented here. The median number of days on ponatinib is 172 (1-193) and the median dose of ponatinib delivered is 30 (16.5-32) mg daily. Overall, 135 grade 3-5 AEs occurred after a median of 51 (0-186) days: 123 (91\%) grade 3, 11 (8\%) grade 4 and 1 fatal AE; 49 (36\%) were hematologic, and 86 (64\%) non-hematologic, and 109 (81\%) were considered as related to study treatment. Seven pts (5\%) discontinued permanently ponatinib, and 56 (41.5\%) received the full planned dose. Six (4.5\%) Grade 3-5 cardiac events (1 fatal cardiac arrest) and 17 (12.5\%) vascular events (15 newly hypertensive pts, 1 pulmonary embolism? 1 carotid stenosis) occurred. Their cumulative incidence is shown in Figure 1A. Digestive \&amp; clinical hepato-biliary events occurred in 10 (7.5\%), infections in 7 (5\%), lipase elevation in 15 (11\%) and liver enzymes elevation in 20 (15\%) pts. Eye, skin and neurologic events occurred in less than 2\% of pts. Regarding efficacy, 147 evaluable pts/158 (93\%) were in CHR at M1, 115 in CCyR (70.5\%) at M3 and 158/163 (97\%) in EMR. The median halving time (calculated with ABL1 as a reference gene) was 13.5 (11.5-17.5) days. The cumulative incidence of molecular response is shown in Figure 1B. Fourty-seven pts over 157 assessable (30\%) were in deep molecular response at M6. One (0.6\%) pt transformed into myeloid blast crisis, alive in CR before transplant. PK data and their relationship with safety and efficacy will be presented. Univariate analysis identified the halving time as the only factor impacting on MR4.5 at M6.Conclusions: Ponatinib displays high anti-leukemic activity as front-line therapy in selected newly diagnosed CP-CML pts with high early molecular response rates with non-negligible severe -in particular cardio-vascular- toxicity at 30 mg QD. Whether or not this will be translated into substantial TFR rates will be determined at later time points.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) historically showed inferior survival with standard rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Phase II studies demonstrated that adding the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide to R-CHOP improved outcomes in ABC-type DLBCL. The goal of the global, phase III ROBUST study was to compare lenalidomide plus R-CHOP (R2-CHOP) with placebo/R-CHOP in previously untreated, ABC-type DLBCL. METHODS: Histology and cell-of-origin type were prospectively analyzed by central pathology prior to random assignment and study treatment. Patients with ABC-DLBCL received lenalidomide oral 15 mg/d, days 1-14/21 plus standard R-CHOP21 versus placebo/R-CHOP21 for six cycles. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) per independent central radiology review. RESULTS: A total of 570 patients with ABC-DLBCL (n = 285 per arm) were stratified by International Prognostic Index score, age, and bulky disease, and randomly assigned to R2-CHOP or placebo/R-CHOP. Baseline demographics were similar between arms. Most patients completed six cycles of treatment: 74\% R2-CHOP and 84\% placebo/R-CHOP. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events for R2-CHOP versus placebo/R-CHOP were neutropenia (60\% v 48\%), anemia (22\% v 14\%), thrombocytopenia (17\% v 11\%), and leukopenia (14\% v 15\%). The primary end point of PFS was not met, with a hazard ratio of 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.63 to 1.14) and P = .29; median PFS has not been reached for either arm. PFS trends favoring R2-CHOP over placebo/R-CHOP were seen in patients with higher-risk disease. CONCLUSION: ROBUST is the first DLBCL phase III study to integrate biomarker-driven identification of eligible ABC patients. Although the ROBUST trial did not meet the primary end point of PFS in all patients, the safety profile of R2-CHOP was consistent with individual treatments with no new safety signals.},

  abstract = {Acquired chromosomal abnormalities are important prognostic factors in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated with supportive care and with disease-modifying therapeutic interventions, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To assess the prognostic impact of cytogenetic characteristics after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation accurately, we investigated a homogeneous group of 523 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes who have received stem cells from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings. Overall survival at five years from transplantation in good, intermediate, and poor cytogenetic risk groups according to the International Prognostic Scoring System was 48\%, 45\% and 30\%, respectively (P{$<$}0.01). Both the disease status (complete remission vs. not in complete remission) and the morphological classification at transplant in the untreated patients were significantly associated with probability of overall survival and relapse-free survival (P{$<$}0.01). The cytogenetic risk groups have no prognostic impact in untreated patients with refractory anemia ¬± ringed sideroblasts (P=0.90). However, combining the good and intermediate cytogenetic risk groups and comparing them to the poor-risk group showed within the other three disease-status-at-transplant groups a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95\%CI: 1.41-2.45). In conclusion, this study shows that, in a large series of patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes, poor-risk cytogenetics as defined by the standard International Prognostic Scoring System is associated with a relatively poor survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings except in patients who are transplanted in refractory anemia/refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts stage before progression to higher myelodysplastic syndrome stages.}

  abstract = {This study investigated the efficacy and safety of azacitidine maintenance in the posttransplant setting based on the encouraging phase 1/2 reports for azacitidine maintenance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS). Between 2009 and 2017, a total of 187 patients aged 18 to 75 years were entered into a randomized controlled study of posttransplant azacitidine if they were in complete remission. Patients randomized to the treatment arm (n = 93) were scheduled to receive azacitidine, given as 32 mg/m2 per day subcutaneously for 5 days every 28 days for 12 cycles. The control arm (n = 94) had no intervention. Eighty-seven of the 93 patients started azacitidine maintenance. The median number of cycles received was 4; a total of 29 patients relapsed on study, and 23 patients withdrew from the study due to toxicity, patient's preference, or logistical reasons. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 2.07 years in the azacitidine group vs 1.28 years in the control group (P = .43). There was also no significant difference for overall survival, with a median of 2.52 years vs 2.56 years in the azacitidine and control groups (P = .85), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed no improvement in RFS or overall survival with the use of azacitidine as maintenance compared with the control group (hazard ratios of 0.73 [95\% confidence interval, 0.49-1.1; P = .14] and 0.84 [95\% confidence interval, 0.55-1.29; P = .43]) [corrected]. This randomized trial with azacitidine maintenance showed that a prospective trial in the posttransplant setting was feasible and safe but challenging. Although RFS was comparable between the 2 arms, we believe the strategy of maintenance therapy merits further study with a goal to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with AML/MDS. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT00887068.}

  abstract = {Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens developed to extend the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to older patients have resulted in encouraging outcomes. We aimed to compare the 2 most commonly used RIC regimens, i.v. fludarabine with busulfan (FluBu) and fludarabine with melphalan (FluMel), in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), we identified 1045 MDS patients age ‚â•60 years who underwent first HSCT with a matched related or matched (8/8) unrelated donor using an RIC regimen. The CIBMTR's definition of RIC was used: a regimen that incorporated an i.v. busulfan total dose ‚â§7.2 mg/kg or a low-dose melphalan total dose ‚â§150 mg/m2. The 2 groups, recipients of FluBu (n~=~697) and recipients of FluMel (n~=~448), were comparable in terms of disease- and transplantation-related characteristics except for the more frequent use of antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab in the FluBu group (39\% versus 31\%). The median age was 67 years in both groups. FluMel was associated with a reduced relapse incidence (RI) compared with FluBu, with a 1-year adjusted incidence of 26\% versus 44\%~(P ‚â§ .0001). Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the FluMel group (26\% versus 16\%; P ‚â§ .0001). Because the magnitude of improvement with FluMel in RI was greater than the improvement in TRM with FluBu, disease-free survival (DFS) was better at 1 year and beyond with FluMel compared with FluBu (48\% versus 40\% at 1 year [P~=~.02] and 35\% versus 27\% at 3 years [P~=~.01]). Overall survival was comparable in the 2 groups at 1 year (63\% versus 61\%; P~=~.4) but was significantly improved with FluMel compared with FluBu at 3 years (46\% versus 39\%; P~=~.03). Our results suggest that FluMel is associated with superior DFS compared with FluBu owing to reduced RI in older patients with MDS patients. ¬© 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

Data were derived from a phase 2 study in patients receiving 160-mg BID and a phase 1/2 study with similar response rates observed with 160-mg BID or 320-mg QD. Given the limited number of patients in the QD dose group, population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analyses were employed to bridge the two regimens. The analyses showed that similar plasma exposure and BTK inhibition were achieved, and differences in trough concentration and maximum plasma concentration between the two regimens are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on efficacy and safety endpoints. The totality of data, including pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, efficacy, and exposure-response analyses, provided support for the recommended 320-mg total daily dose for the approved indication.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The clinical outcome of multiple myeloma (MM) is heterogeneous. A simple and reliable tool is needed to stratify patients with MM. We combined the International Staging System (ISS) with chromosomal abnormalities (CA) detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization after CD138 plasma cell purification and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to evaluate their prognostic value in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from 4,445 patients with NDMM enrolled onto 11 international trials were pooled together. The K-adaptive partitioning algorithm was used to define the most appropriate subgroups with homogeneous survival. RESULTS: ISS, CA, and LDH data were simultaneously available in 3,060 of 4,445 patients. We defined the following three groups: revised ISS (R-ISS) I (n = 871), including ISS stage I (serum Œ≤2-microglobulin level {$<$} 3.5 mg/L and serum albumin level ‚â• 3.5 g/dL), no high-risk CA [del(17p) and/or t(4;14) and/or t(14;16)], and normal LDH level (less than the upper limit of normal range); R-ISS III (n = 295), including ISS stage III (serum Œ≤2-microglobulin level {$>$} 5.5 mg/L) and high-risk CA or high LDH level; and R-ISS II (n = 1,894), including all the other possible combinations. At a median follow-up of 46 months, the 5-year OS rate was 82\% in the R-ISS I, 62\% in the R-ISS II, and 40\% in the R-ISS III groups; the 5-year PFS rates were 55\%, 36\%, and 24\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The R-ISS is a simple and powerful prognostic staging system, and we recommend its use in future clinical studies to stratify patients with NDMM effectively with respect to the relative risk to their survival.},

  abstract = {Although rituximab has revolutionized the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a significant proportion of patients experience refractory disease or relapse early after the end of treatment. The lack of effective treatment options in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) setting had made the prognosis of these patients dismal. The initial enthusiasm for novel anti-CD20 antibodies had been short-lived as they failed to prove their superiority to rituximab. Therefore, research has focused on developing novel agents with a unique mechanism of action. Among them, two antibody-drug conjugates, namely polatuzumab vedotin (PolaV) and loncastuximab tesirine, along with tafasitamab, an anti-CD19 bioengineered antibody, have been approved for the treatment of R/R DLBCL. Whereas PolaV has been FDA and EMA approved, EMA has not approved loncastuximab tesirine and tafasitamab yet. Results from randomized trials, as well as real-life data for PolaV have been promising. Novel agents as bispecific antibodies bridging CD3 on T-cells to CD20 have shown very promising results in clinical trials and are expected to gain approval for treatment of R/R DLBCL soon. As the therapeutic armamentarium against DLBCL is expanding, an improvement in survival of patients with R/R and higher cure rates might soon become evident.},

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and their biosimilars are used to treat anaemia in MDS and, currently, epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are commonly used and recommended by clinical guidelines. To better understand the evidence available on the use of ESAs for anaemia in lower-risk MDS, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify randomized and nonrandomized prospective studies reporting on clinical efficacy/effectiveness, patient-reported quality of life (QoL), and safety. We extended our review to include retrospective studies for darbepoetin alfa specifically and to ascertain the feasibility of completing an indirect network meta-analysis comparing epoetin and darbepoetin alfa. Overall, 53 articles reporting on 35 studies were included. The studies indicated a clinical benefit of ESAs, with benefits observed across key clinical outcomes. ESAs showed consistent improvement in erythroid response rates (ESA-naive, 45-73\%; previous ESA exposure, 25-75\%) and duration of response. Comparative studies demonstrated similar progression to acute myeloid leukaemia and several showed improved overall survival and QoL. Limited safety concerns were identified. This analysis confirmed ESA therapy should be the foremost first-line treatment of anaemia in most patients with lower-risk MDS who lack the 5q deletion.}

  abstract = {Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a CD30-positive T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that morphologically resembles ALK-positive ALCL but lacks chromosomal rearrangements of the ALK gene. The genetic and clinical heterogeneity of ALK-negative ALCL has not been delineated. We performed immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization on 73 ALK-negative ALCLs and 32 ALK-positive ALCLs and evaluated the associations among pathology, genetics, and clinical outcome. Chromosomal rearrangements of DUSP22 and TP63 were identified in 30\% and 8\% of ALK-negative ALCLs, respectively. These rearrangements were mutually exclusive and were absent in ALK-positive ALCLs. Five-year overall survival rates were 85\% for ALK-positive ALCLs, 90\% for DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs, 17\% for TP63-rearranged ALCLs, and 42\% for cases lacking all 3 genetic markers (P \&lt; .0001). Hazard ratios for death in these 4 groups after adjusting for International Prognostic Index and age were 1.0 (reference group), 0.58, 8.63, and 4.16, respectively (P = 7.10 √ó 10‚àí5). These results were similar when restricted to patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy, as well as to patients not receiving stem cell transplantation. Thus, ALK-negative ALCL is a genetically heterogeneous disease with widely disparate outcomes following standard therapy. DUSP22 and TP63 rearrangements may serve as predictive biomarkers to help guide patient management.},

  abstract = {Background: Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) provide symptom improvement and spleen volume reduction in patients with primary, post-polycythemia vera, and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (MF). There remains a substantial unmet need for therapies that alter disease trajectory, improve outcomes, and enhance survival. The COMFORT-1 and -2 studies established JAKi monotherapy as standard-of-care with spleen volume reduction of ‚â•35\% at Week 24 (SVR 35W24) of 42\% and SVR 35W48 of 29\%, respectively. In combination with the JAKi ruxolitinib, navitoclax, an orally available inhibitor of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 proteins (BCL-X L, BCL-2, BCL-W), was shown to have pronounced antitumor activity in patients with MF in the phase 2 REFINE trial (NCT03222609). TRANSFORM-1 is an ongoing, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international study evaluating the safety and efficacy of navitoclax plus ruxolitinib (NAV + RUX) compared with placebo plus ruxolitinib (PBO + RUX) in JAK2i-na√Øve adults with MF.Methods: TRANSFORM-1 (NCT04472598) enrolled adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF with measurable splenomegaly, evidence of MF-related symptoms, no prior JAK2i treatment, and ECOG Performance Score ‚â§2. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive NAV (starting dose of 200 mg [platelet \{PLT\} \&gt;150 √ó 10 9/L] or 100 mg escalated to 200 mg once daily if tolerated after ‚â•7 days [PLT ‚â§150 √ó 10 9/L]) or PBO, plus RUX at label dose, based on stratification factors of intermediate-2 vs high-risk MF and PLT ‚â§200 √ó 10 9/L vs \&gt;200 √ó 10 9/L. The primary endpoint was SVR 35W24. Secondary endpoints included change in total symptom score at Week 24 (TSS W24) assessed using 7-item MFSAF v4.0 (scale 0-70), SVR 35 at any time, duration of SVR 35, anemia response (per International Working Group criteria), reduction in marrow fibrosis, overall survival, leukemia-free survival, reduction in PROMIS Fatigue scale, and improvement in EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning scale. Exploratory endpoints include progression-free survival.Results: At data cutoff, April 13, 2023, 252 patients were enrolled with a median (range) follow-up of 14.9 (0.0-29.5) months; 125 patients were randomized to receive NAV + RUX and 127 to receive PBO + RUX. Most patients were male (57\%), median (range) age was 69 (37-87) years, and patient demographics were similar between treatment arms ( Table 1). TRANSFORM-1 met its primary endpoint, with 79 patients (63.2\%) in the NAV + RUX arm achieving SVR 35W24 compared with 40 patients (31.5\%) in the PBO + RUX arm ( P\&lt;0.0001). Notably, SVR 35 at any time was achieved by 96 patients (77\%) with NAV + RUX compared with 53 patients (42\%) with PBO + RUX. Median (range) time to SVR 35 response was 12.3 (10.1-48.3) weeks with NAV + RUX versus 12.4 (11.3-72.3) weeks with PBO + RUX. Median duration of SVR 35 was not reached (NR) in the NAV + RUX arm compared with 19.4 months (95\% CI 16.8, NR) in the PBO + RUX arm. At Week 24, the mean change in TSS from baseline was -9.7 (95\% CI: -11.8, -7.6) with NAV + RUX compared with -11.1 (95\% CI: -13.2, -9.1) with PBO + RUX arm ( P=0.2852). Grade ‚â•3 adverse events (AEs) were experienced by 85\% of patients with NAV + RUX and 70\% with PBO + RUX. The most common AEs (\&gt;30\% of patients receiving NAV; Table 2) were thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, and neutropenia. Serious AEs were experienced by 26\% of patients with NAV + RUX and 32\% with PBO + RUX, including anemia (NAV + RUX: n=2; PBO + RUX: n=1), thrombocytopenia (NAV + RUX: n=2), and neutropenia (NAV + RUX: n=1). With NAV + RUX, AEs led to NAV dose reduction in 101 (81\%) patients and NAV interruption in 87 (70\%) patients of which 83 (67\%) and 65 (52\%) were due to thrombocytopenia, respectively. Of all enrolled patients, 83 (33\%) discontinued study treatment; most common (\&gt;5\% total patients) reason for NAV/PBO discontinuation were AEs (n=32; 39\% of discontinuations) and physician decision (n=14; 17\% of discontinuations). In each arm, 13 (10\%) patients died; 6 with NAV + RUX and 5 with PBO + RUX died ‚â§30 days post-final dose.Conclusions: This first randomized trial in JAKi-na√Øve MF with NAV + RUX combination led to an SVR 35W24 rate that was twice as high as PBO + RUX ( P\&lt;0.0001). The responses were durable; AEs of thrombocytopenia and anemia were common but manageable with dose modification without any clinically significant sequalae. Additional evaluation is ongoing.},

  abstract = {Elevated serum ferritin levels occur due to iron overload or during inflammation and macrophage activation. A correlation of high serum ferritin levels with increased mortality after alloSCT has been suggested by several retrospective analyses as well as by two smaller prospective studies. This prospective multicentric study aimed to study the association of ferritin serum levels before start of conditioning with alloSCT outcome. Patients with acute leukemia, lymphoma or MDS receiving a matched sibling alloSCT for the first time were considered for inclusion, regardless of conditioning. A comparison of outcomes between patients with high and low ferritin level was performed using univariate analysis and multivariate analysis using cause-specific Cox model. Twenty centers reported data on 298 alloSCT recipients. The ferritin cut off point was determined at 1500 Œºg/l (median of measured ferritin levels). In alloSCT recipients with ferritin levels above cut off measured before the start of conditioning, overall survival (HR = 2.5, CI = 1.5-4.1, p = 0.0005) and progression-free survival (HR = 2.4, CI = 1.6-3.8, p {$<$} 0.0001) were inferior. Excess mortality in the high ferritin group was due to both higher relapse incidence (HR = 2.2, CI = 1.2-3.8, p = 0.007) and increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR = 3.1, CI = 1.5-6.4, p = 0.002). NRM was driven by significantly higher infection-related mortality in the high ferritin group (HR = 3.9, CI = 1.6-9.7, p = 0.003). Acute and chronic GVHD incidence or severity were not associated to serum ferritin levels. We conclude that ferritin levels can serve as routine laboratory biomarker for mortality risk assessment before alloSCT.},

The EBMT identified 38,760 allo-HCT recipients with hematologic malignancies transplanted between 2010 and 2018 from matched sibling and unrelated donors with a full data set of pre-existing comorbidities. Multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional-hazards model including known risk factors for non-relapse mortality (NRM) were performed. We found that pre-existing renal comorbidity had the strongest association with NRM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.85 [95\% CI 1.55-2.19]). In addition, the association of multiple pre-existing comorbidities with NRM was significant, including diabetes, infections, cardiac comorbidity, and pulmonary comorbidity. However, the HR of the association of these comorbidities with NRM was relatively low and did not exceed 1.24. Consequently, the risk of NRM was only moderately increased in patients with a high hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) ‚â• 3 (HR 1.34 [1.26-1.42]). In the current EBMT population, pre-existing non-renal comorbidities determined NRM after allo-HCT to a much lesser extent as compared with the underlying HCT-CI data. Improvements in management and supportive care as well as higher awareness based on the use of HCT-CI may have contributed to this favorable development.}

All patients received TKI and aSCT in first complete remission (CR1). Copy number analysis was performed with SNP arrays and validated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The frequencies of recurrently deleted genes were: IKZF1, 76\%, CDKN2A/2B, 45\%, PAX5, 43\%, BTG1, 18\%, EBF1, 13\%, ETV6, 5\%, RB, 14\%. In univariate analyses, the presence of CDKN2A/2B deletions had a negative impact on all endpoints: overall survival (p=0.023), disease free survival (p=0.012) and remission duration (p=0.036). The negative predictive value of CDKN2A/2B deletions was retained in multivariable analysis along with other factors such as timing of TKI therapy, intensity of conditioning, achieving remission after induction phase I and BTG1 deletions. We therefore conclude that acquired genomic CDKN2A/2B deletions identify a subgroup of Ph+ ALL patients, who have an inferior prognosis despite aSCT in CR1. Their poor outcome was attributable primarily to a high relapse rate after aSCT.},

We examined the prevalence of KD mutations in newly diagnosed and imatinib-naive Ph+ ALL patients and assessed their clinical relevance in the setting of uniform frontline therapy with imatinib in combination with chemotherapy. Patients enrolled in the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) trial ADE10 for newly diagnosed elderly Ph+ ALL were retrospectively examined for the presence of BCR-ABL KD mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC), cDNA sequencing, and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A KD mutation was detected in a minor subpopulation of leukemic cells in 40\% of newly diagnosed and imatinib-naive patients. At relapse, the dominant cell clone harbored an identical mutation in 90\% of cases, the overall prevalence of mutations at relapse was 80\%. P-loop mutations predominated and were not associated with an inferior hematologic or molecular remission rate or shorter remission duration compared with unmutated BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL mutations conferring high-level imatinib resistance are present in a substantial proportion of patients with de novo Ph+ ALL and eventually give rise to relapse. This provides a rationale for the frontline use of kinase inhibitors active against these BCR-ABL mutants.},

Imatinib administration subsequent to SCT may prevent relapse, but the role of scheduling and its impact on outcome are not known. In a prospective, randomized multicenter trial, we compared the tolerability and efficacy of post-transplant imatinib administered either prophylactically (arm A; n=26) or following detection of MRD (arm B; n=29). Prophylactic imatinib significantly reduced the incidence of molecular recurrence after SCT compared with MRD-triggered imatinib (40\% vs 69\%; P=0.046). Median duration of PCR negativity was 26.5 and 6.8 months, respectively (P=0.065). Five-year survival in both interventional groups was high (80 and 74.5\%), despite premature discontinuation of imatinib in the majority of patients because of poor tolerability. Relapse probability was significantly higher in patients who became MRD positive (P=0.017). In conclusion, post-transplant imatinib results in a low relapse rate, durable remissions and excellent long-term outcome in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL irrespective of whether it is given prophylactically or MRD-triggered. Reappearance of BCR-ABL1 transcripts early after SCT or at higher levels identifies a small subset of patients who do not benefit sufficiently from imatinib, and in whom alternative approaches should be explored.},

  abstract = {Background: Unmet need remains for novel therapies after failure of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent (TD) lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS). In IMerge Phase 2 (NCT02598661), treatment with imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor, resulted in prolonged, durable transfusion independence (TI) across a broad range of heavily RBC TD ESA relapsed/refractory non-del(5q) LR-MDS patients (pts) naive to lenalidomide and hypomethylating agents (len/HMA). Aims: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of imetelstat vs placebo in this pt population in IMerge Phase 3. Methods: Heavily RBC TD ESA relapsed/refractory/ineligible (R/R) non-del(5q) LR-MDS pts naive to len/HMA were randomized 2:1 to receive imetelstat 7.5 mg/kg (N=118) or placebo (N=60) every 4 wks. The primary endpoint was 8-wk TI rate; subgroup analyses included IPSS risk, prior transfusion burden, and ring sideroblasts (RS) status. Secondary endpoints included 24-wk TI rate, TI duration, and hematologic improvement-erythroid (HI-E) rate. Change in mutation burden (variant allele frequency [VAF]) was exploratory. The primary analysis cutoff was Oct 2022; cutoff for ‚â•1-yr TI was Jan 2023. The primary and key secondary endpoints were compared using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by prior transfusion burden and IPSS category. TI duration was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by stratified log-rank test. Results: The primary endpoint was met; 47 pts (39.8\%) vs 9 pts (15.0\%) receiving imetelstat vs placebo achieved 8-wk TI, P {$<$} 0.001. The rate of 8-wk TI was also significantly higher with imetelstat vs placebo across subgroups, including in RS negative pts. Median TI duration (95\% CI) was 51.6 (26.9‚Äì83.9) wks with imetelstat vs 13.3 (8.0‚Äì24.9) wks with placebo, P {$<$} 0.001. Twenty-four-wk TI was achieved in 33 pts (28.0\%) vs 2 pts (3.3\%) receiving imetelstat vs placebo, P {$<$} 0.001. With 3 months‚Äô additional follow-up, 21 pts (17.8\%) on imetelstat vs 1 pt (1.7\%) on placebo achieved ‚â•1-yr TI, P = 0.002, representing 63.6\% of ‚â•24-wk TI imetelstat responders (Figure). HI-E rates (2018 IWG, emphasizing {$>$}16-wk response) were 42.4\% with imetelstat vs 13.3\% with placebo, P {$<$} 0.001. Pts receiving imetelstat had significantly higher mean hemoglobin (P {$<$} 0.001) and fewer transfusions (P = 0.042) over time than those on placebo. VAF reduction in 3 genes frequently mutated in MDS was significantly greater in pts treated with imetelstat than placebo: SF3B1 (P {$<$} 0.001), TET2 (P = 0.032), DNMT3A (P = 0.019) and ASXL1 (P = NS). SF3B1 VAF reduction correlated with longer TI duration in imetelstat-treated pts, P {$<$} 0.001. No new safety signals were identified in IMerge P3. The most common Grade 3/4 AEs with imetelstat were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia; similar rates of Grade ‚â•3 bleeding and infections were observed on imetelstat and placebo. Cytopenias with imetelstat were of short duration, and {$>$}80\% resolved to Grade ‚â§2 within 4 wks. Summary/Conclusion: Imetelstat demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy with robust 8-wk, 24-wk, and 1-yr TI rates and durable continuous TI. For this LR-MDS patient population, almost one fifth of imetelstat-treated pts achieved continuous TI for ‚â•1 yr, representing substantial relief from transfusion-associated complications. VAF reduction and its correlation to clinical endpoints, including durable TI, support imetelstat‚Äôs disease-modifying potential. Safety results were consistent with prior reports. Imetelstat treatment provides significant clinical benefit to a heavily TD LR MDS pt population in need of novel therapy.Keywords: Therapy, Clinical trial, Myelodysplastic syndrome, Telomerase activity},

In 2006, the International Working Group (IWG) proposed a revision to previously published standardized response criteria (IWG 2000) for uniformly evaluating clinical responses in MDSs. These IWG 2006 criteria have been used prospectively in many clinical trials in MDSs, but proved challenging in several of them, especially for the evaluation of erythroid response. In this report, we provide rationale for modifications (IWG 2018) of these recommendations, mainly for "hematological improvement" criteria used for lower-risk MDSs, based on recent practical and reported experience in clinical trials. Most suggestions relate to erythroid response assessment, which are refined in an overall more stringent manner. Two major proposed changes are the differentiation between "procedures" and "criteria" for hematologic improvement-erythroid assessment and a new categorization of transfusion-burden subgroups.}

In the recent era several upcoming new options are improving the therapeutic landscape for relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL setting, first of all anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) that already represent a standard of care as third-line therapy and are rapidly moving as second-line treatment for those who are refractory or early relapse after R-CHOP. Among these new therapies, the combinations polatuzumab plus rituximab and bendamustine, tafasitamab plus lenalidomide for transplant ineligible patients, and CD3xCD20 bispecific antibodies are the most relevant, but several other agents and strategies are on the way. On the other hand, in the last 20~years, several efforts have been spent in the attempt to ameliorate the outcome over R-CHOP for the frontline treatment of DLBCL shortening the interval between the cycles or intensifying treatment or adding novel drugs to R-CHOP without success, so far. Recent studies combining the anti-CD79b antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab vedotin plus R-CHP and the anti-BCL2 agent venetoclax plus R-CHOP showed promising results. Preliminary data of new upcoming strategies characterized by a tailored therapy based on different molecular subtypes of DLBCL are encouraging, showing a benefit over the standard R-CHOP. In this manuscript, the literature data on the landscape of new therapies available and upcoming for both frontline and R/R settings of DLBCL will be critically reviewed.},

  abstract = {Anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy has demonstrated high response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B cell malignancies but is associated with significant toxicity. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most significant complication associated with CAR T cell therapy, and it is critical to have a reproducible and easy method to grade CRS after CAR T cell infusions. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale is inadequate for grading CRS associated with cellular therapy. Clinical experience with the anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy tisagenlecleucel at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) was used to develop the Penn grading scale for CRS. The Penn grading scale depends on easily accessible clinical features; does not rely on location of care or quantitation of supportive care; assigns grades to guide CRS management; distinguishes between mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening CRS; and applies to both early-onset and delayed-onset CRS associated with T cell therapies. Clinical data from 55 pediatric patients with r/r B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 42 patients with r/r chronic lymphocytic lymphoma treated with tisagenlecleucel were used to demonstrate the current application of the Penn grading scale. We show that the Penn grading scale provides reproducible CRS grading that can be useful to guide therapy and that can be applied across clinical trials and treatment platforms.},

A recent bleeding history combined with recent labs are important for hemostatic management decision during surgical interventions. Antifibrinolytics appear safe in the population of older adults, whereas desmopressin (DDAVP) should be used cautiously. Where needed, factor concentrates present a great treatment option. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome is vastly underrecognized, but likely to surface in the aging, especially in the setting of comorbidities, such as plasma-cell dyscrasias.

  abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as highly effective in relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but only about 40\% patients have achieved sustained responses. Here, we conducted a phase II clinical trial testing efficacy and toxicities of CAR-T therapy in R/R non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (NCT03196830). Among enrolled patients, 33 R/R DLBCL patients pretreated with DFC (decitabine, fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide) lymphodepletion chemotherapy and infused with tandem CD19-CD22 based CAR-T cells were drawn out for efficacy and toxicities of CAR-T therapy evaluation. With a median follow-up of 10.9(0.6-29.0) months, the best overall response and complete remission (CR) rates were 90.9\% and 63.6\%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.2 months and overall survival (OS) was undefined. The 2-year OS and PFS rates were 54.3\% and 47.2\%, respectively. No severe grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed and grade 3 CRS was observed in only 7 patients; 3 patients developed mild immune effect or cell-associated neurotoxic syndrome. All toxicities were transient and reversible and no CAR-T-related mortality. Further subgroup analysis showed that achieving CR was an independent prognostic factor associated with favorable PFS and OS. The 2-year OS and PFS for patients who achieved CR within 3 months (undefined versus undefined P=0.021 and undefined versus undefined P=0.036) or during the follow-up period were significantly longer than those who did not (undefined versus 4.6 months P {$<$} 0.0001 and undefined versus 2.0months P{$<$}0.001). While severe CRS was also an independent prognostic factor but associated with inferior PFS and OS. The 2-year OS and PFS for patients with grade 3 CRS were significantly shorter than those with grade 0-2 CRS (4.1 months versus undefined P{$<$}0.0001 and 1.7 months versus undefined P=0.0002). This study indicated that CD19/CD22 dual-targeted CAR-T therapy under a decitabine-containing lymphodepletion regimen may be a safe, potent effective approach to R/R DLBCL patients.},

  abstract = {Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are emerging as an important novel class of immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), and are set to be more widely used in clinical practice. However, this new class of therapies is associated with a distinct adverse event (AE) profile that includes cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, as well as AEs leading to increased infection risk such as cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections themselves. As preliminary data with this class of agents shows an increased risk of infections as compared with conventional MM treatment regimens, such as immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), guidance on infection monitoring, prophylaxis and treatment is required. This review provides consensus recommendations from a panel of 13 global experts, following a meeting in August 2022. The meeting objective was to review existing literature and identify relevant information on infections with all BsAbs in patients with MM, as well as to discuss clinical experience of experts in managing these infections. The recommendations outlined here can be used to guide management of infection risk factors, such as hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia. In addition, they can be used to guide the monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of bacterial, viral and fungal infections, including emerging infections of interest, such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the use of vaccinations prior to and during BsAb treatment. The recommendations have been graded by the panel based on level of data available. Key recommendations include universal herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus prophylaxis, screening for hepatitis B virus reactivation risk in all patients, monthly intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for immunoparesis and in the absence of life-threatening infectious manifestations, use of colony-stimulating factors in patients with Grade 3 neutropenia, universal pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis and no routine anti-fungal prophylaxis.},

These changes are based on the identification of biomarkers associated with near inevitable development of CRAB features in patients who would otherwise be regarded as having smouldering multiple myeloma. A delay in application of the label of multiple myeloma and postponement of therapy could be detrimental to these patients. In addition to this change, we clarify and update the underlying laboratory and radiographic variables that fulfil the criteria for the presence of myeloma-defining CRAB features, and the histological and monoclonal protein requirements for the disease diagnosis. Finally, we provide specific metrics that new biomarkers should meet for inclusion in the disease definition. The International Myeloma Working Group recommends the implementation of these criteria in routine practice and in future clinical trials, and recommends that future studies analyse any differences in outcome that might occur as a result of the new disease definition.},

  abstract = {BackgroundMyelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, anemia, splenomegaly and MF-associated symptoms. These hallmarks result from dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway and BET-mediated MF target gene modulation. Pelabresib (CPI-0610; pela) is an investigational oral small-molecule drug designed to inhibit BET-mediated gene transcription involved in MF pathogenesis. Preclinical data support the potential of combining pela with therapiesthat target overlapping pathways, such as JAK/STAT, to improve response by inhibiting the molecular drivers of MF. The Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 trial was initiated based on compelling data from Arm 3 of the ongoing Phase 2 MANIFEST study (NCT02158858), which is evaluating the combination of pela and ruxolitinib (rux) in JAK inhibitor (JAKi) treatment-na√Øve patients (pts) with MF. In Arm 3 of MANIFEST, primary endpoint analyses at 24 Weeks (Wks) for the 84 pts enrolled reported SVR35 (‚â•35\% reduction in spleen volume from baseline) in 68\% of pts and TSS50 (‚â•50\% reduction in Total Symptom Score [TSS] from baseline) in 56\% of pts (Mascarenhas, et al. 2023).AimsMANIFEST-2 (NCT04603495) is a global, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-control study of pela + rux versus placebo + rux in JAKi treatment-na√Øve pts with primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pela + rux. Here we present the study design and baseline patient stratification for MANIFEST-2. Results from the primary analysis of MANIFEST-2 will be presented at the ASH Annual Meeting 2023.MethodsThe MANIFEST-2 study schema is shown in Figure 1. Key eligibility criteria include a DIPSS score of Intermediate-1 (Int-1) or higher, platelet count ‚â•100 √ó 10 9/L, spleen volume ‚â•450 cm 3 by CT or MRI, ‚â•2 symptoms with an average score ‚â•3 or a TSS of ‚â•10 using the MFSAF v4.0, peripheral blast count \&lt;5\% and an ECOG performance status ‚â§2. Patient randomization was stratified by DIPSS risk category (Int-1 vs Int-2 vs High), platelet count (\&gt;200 √ó 10 9/L vs 100-200 √ó 10 9/L) and spleen volume (‚â•1800 cm 3 vs \&lt;1800 cm 3). Double-blind treatment of pela (125-175 mg) or placebo was administered once daily for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day break, which is considered one cycle of treatment. Rux (5-25 mg) was administered twice daily based on platelet counts and spleen response for all 21 days of the cycle. The primary endpoint is SVR35 response at Wk 24. Secondary endpoints include TSS50, percentage change in TSS, safety, pharmacokinetics, changes in bone marrow fibrosis, progression-free survival, overall survival, conversion from transfusion dependence to independence and rate of red blood cell transfusion for the first 24 wks.ResultsA total of 591 pts were screened at 138 sites. Following the screening process, 431 pts from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia were randomized. The number of pts assigned to each randomization stratum are presented in Table 1; the majority of pts presented with DIPSS Int-1 or -2, had a platelet count above 200 √ó 10 9/L and spleen volume below 1800 cm 3. The study opened for enrolment in November 2020; the first patient received their initial treatment on April 22, 2021, and the last patient received their first treatment on March 2, 2023. The last patient is expected to reach the 24-wk primary endpoint on August 31, 2023, following which a primary analysis will occur. As of June 27, 2023 there were 383 pts ongoing in the study.ConclusionThe Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 study was initiated based on compelling data from the ongoing Phase 2 MANIFEST study, in which the combination of pela and rux in Arm 3 demonstrated significant clinical activity and disease-modifying potential without clinically relevant treatment-limiting toxicity. MANIFEST-2 has completed recruitment and will provide definitive efficacy results of combination therapy in JAKi treatment-na√Øve pts with MF. As DIPSS Int-1 pts have been excluded or underrepresented in prior randomized trials in MF, MANIFEST-2 will also provide important insights in assessing the benefits of starting treatment at an earlier stage of the disease. Primary results from the pivotal Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 trial of pela and rux versus placebo and rux in JAKi treatment-na√Øve pts may have the potential to influence the MF treatment paradigm and will be presented at the ASH Annual Meeting 2023.},

Patients achieving MMR at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months had a better survival (P = .02, .04, .05, and .01, respectively). Negative MFC at CR did not predict for improved survival (P = .2). At 3 and 12 months, negative MRD by MFC was associated with improved survival (P = .04 and .001). MRD monitoring by PCR and MFC identifies patients who benefit from treatment intensification in first CR.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The long-term efficacy of a combination of chemotherapy and dasatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not well established. METHODS Patients received dasatinib with 8 cycles of alternating hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone and high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate. Patients in complete remission (CR) continued maintenance dasatinib, vincristine, and prednisone for 2 years, which was followed by dasatinib indefinitely. Patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) received it during their first CR. RESULTS Seventy-two patients with a median age of 55 years (range, 21-80 years) were treated; 69 (96\%) achieved CR. Among them, 57 (83\%) achieved cytogenetic CR after 1 cycle, and 64 (93\%) achieved a major molecular response at a median of 4 weeks (range, 2-38 weeks). Sixty-five patients (94\%) were negative for minimal residual disease assessed by flow cytometry at a median of 3 weeks (range, 2-37 weeks). Dasatinib-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events included bleeding, pleural/pericardial effusions, and elevated transaminases. With a median follow-up of 67 months (range, 33-97 months), 33 patients (46\%) were alive, and 30 (43\%) were in CR; 12 underwent allogeneic SCT. Thirty-nine patients died (3 at induction, 19 after relapse, 7 after SCT performed during first CR, and 10 during CR). The median disease-free survival and overall survival were 31 (range, 0.3-97 months) and 47 months (range, 0.2-97 months), respectively. Seven relapsed patients had BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, including 4 with T315I.

Differences in protein interactions and activated signaling pathways that may be associated with the different diseases driven by p210 and p190 are unknown. We have performed a quantitative comparative proteomics study of p210 and p190. Strong differences in the interactome and tyrosine phosphoproteome were found and validated. Whereas the AP2 adaptor complex that regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis interacts preferentially with p190, the phosphatase Sts1 is enriched with p210. Stronger activation of the Stat5 transcription factor and the Erk1/2 kinases is observed with p210, whereas Lyn kinase is activated by p190. Our findings provide a more coherent understanding of Bcr-Abl signaling, mechanisms of leukemic transformation, resulting disease pathobiology and responses to kinase inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Hematotoxicity represents a frequent chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell‚Äìrelated adverse event and remains poorly understood. In this multicenter analysis, we studied patterns of hematopoietic reconstitution and evaluated potential predictive markers in 258 patients receiving axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) or tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We observed profound (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] \&lt;100 cells per ¬µL) neutropenia in 72\% of patients and prolonged (21 days or longer) neutropenia in 64\% of patients. The median duration of severe neutropenia (ANC \&lt; 500 cells per ¬µL) was 9 days. We aimed to identify predictive biomarkers of hematotoxicity using the duration of severe neutropenia until day +60 as the primary end point. In the training cohort (n\,=\,58), we observed a significant correlation with baseline thrombocytopenia (r\,=\,‚àí0.43; P\,=\,.001) and hyperferritinemia (r\,=\,0.54; P\,\&lt;\,.0001) on univariate and multivariate analysis. Incidence and severity of cytokine-release syndrome, immune effector cell‚Äìassociated neurotoxicity syndrome, and peak cytokine levels were not associated with the primary end point. We created the CAR-HEMATOTOX model, which included markers associated with hematopoietic reserve (eg, platelet count, hemoglobin, and ANC) and baseline inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein and ferritin). This model was validated in independent cohorts, one from Europe (n\,=\,91) and one from the United States (n\,=\,109) and discriminated patients with severe neutropenia ‚â•14 days to \&lt;14 days (pooled validation: area under the curve, 0.89; sensitivity, 89\%; specificity, 68\%). A high CAR-HEMATOTOX score resulted in a longer duration of neutropenia (12 vs 5.5 days; P \&lt; .001) and a higher incidence of severe thrombocytopenia (87\% vs 34\%; P \&lt; .001) and anemia (96\% vs 40\%; P \&lt; .001). The score implicates bone marrow reserve and inflammation prior to CAR T-cell therapy as key features associated with delayed cytopenia and will be useful for risk-adapted management of hematotoxicity.},

The PONALFIL (Ponatinib With Chemotherapy for Young Adults Ph Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) trial combined ponatinib (30 mg/d) with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients aged 18 to 60 years. Ponatinib was only given pre-emptively after alloHSCT. Primary end points were hematologic and molecular response before alloHSCT and event-free survival (EFS), including molecular relapse as event. Thirty patients (median age, 49 years; range, 19-59 years) entered the trial. All exhibited hematologic response, and alloHSCT was performed in 26 patients (20 in complete molecular response and 6 in major molecular response). Only 1 patient died (of graft-versus-host disease), and 5 patients exhibited molecular relapse after alloHSCT. No tyrosine kinase inhibitor was given after HSCT in 18 of 26 patients. Twenty-nine patients are alive (median follow-up, 2.1 years; range, 0.2-4.0 years), with 3-year EFS and overall survival (OS) of 70\% (95\% confidence interval, 51-89) and 96\% (95\% confidence interval, 89-100), respectively. Comparison of the PONALFIL and the ALLPh08 (Chemotherapy and Imatinib in Young Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Ph [BCR-ABL] Positive; same schedule, using imatinib as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor) trials by propensity score showed significant improvement in OS for patients in PONALFIL (3-year OS, 96\% vs 53\%; P = .002). The most frequent grade 3 to 4 adverse events were hematologic (42\%), infectious (17\%), and hepatic (22\%), with only one vascular occlusive event. The combination of chemotherapy with ponatinib followed by alloHSCT is well tolerated, with encouraging EFS in adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. Cross-trial comparison suggests improvement vs imatinib (clinicaltrials.gov identifier \#NCT02776605).},

The majority of these patients (76\%) were reclassified as intermediate or higher risk according to R-IPSS. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and PFS were 58\% and 54\%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, adverse risk factors for PFS were marrow blast percentage (hazard ratio (HR): 1.77, P=0.037), donor/recipient CMV serostatus (donor-/recipient+: HR: 2.02, P=0.011) and source of stem cells (marrow and non-CR: HR: 5.72, P{$<$}0.0001, marrow and CR: HR: 3.17, P=0.027). Independent risk factors for OS were disease status at time of transplant and the use of in vivo T-cell depletion (TCD). Patients who did not receive TCD and were transplanted from an unrelated donor had worse OS (HR: 4.08, P{$<$}0.0001). In conclusion, 'lower' risk MDS patients have better outcome than those with 'higher risk' after haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Selecting the right source of stem cells, a CMV-positive donor for CMV-positive patients and using in vivo TCD results in the best outcome in these patients. More studies are needed to evaluate the role of HSCT in these patients as compared with conventional treatment.}

The advantage of HSCT over other treatment comes from retrospective studies and the aim of the current study was to prospectively test this hypothesis, analyzing in particular patients from the pre-transplant period to avoid the selection bias of performing transplantation. This study was conducted to compare overall survival in MDS patients candidates to transplantation according to donor availability. The majority of patients (76\%) received a treatment with DMA after registration, 69\% had a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor, 70\% of whom were transplanted. Baseline patient and disease characteristics were similar according to donor availability. Four-year overall survival was significantly better in patients with an HLA matched donor (37\%) compared to patients without donor (15\%). There was also evidence that this overall survival advantage was because of transplantation. Mortality risk was decreased after transplantation but it became significant only after the second year post transplant, because of early transplant-related mortality. Our results appear to justify, in higher risk MDS, a transplantation approach in all potential candidates who have an HLA identical donor.}

The IWG now proposes a consensus-based ITP-specific bleeding assessment tool (ITP-BAT) with definitions and terminology consistent with those adopted for other bleeding disorders. Bleeding manifestations were grouped into three major domains: skin (S), visible mucosae (M), and organs (O), with gradation of severity (SMOG). Each bleeding manifestation is assessed at the time of examination. Severity is graded from 0 to 3 or 4, with grade 5 for any fatal bleeding. Bleeding reported by the patient without medical documentation is graded 1. Within each domain, the same grade is assigned to bleeding manifestations of similar clinical impact. The ‚Äúworst bleeding manifestation since the last visit‚Äù (observation period) is graded (a suitable database collection form is provided), and the highest grade within each domain is recorded. The SMOG system provides a consistent description of the bleeding phenotype in ITP, and the IWG unanimously supports its adoption and validation in future clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy is an innovative form of adoptive cell therapy that has revolutionized the treatment of certain hematological malignancies, including B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The treatment is currently also being studied in other B-cell neoplasms, including multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CD19 and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) have been the most popular target antigens for CAR-T-cell immunotherapy of these malignancies. This review will discuss the efficacy and toxicity data from the pivotal clinical studies of CD19- and BCMA-targeted CAR-T-cell therapies in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies (NHL, ALL, CLL) and MM, respectively.},

CADENZA was a 26-week randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to assess safety and efficacy of sutimlimab in patients with CAD without recent (within 6 months prior to enrollment) transfusion history. Forty-two patients with screening hemoglobin ‚â§10 g/dL, elevated bilirubin, and ‚â•1 CAD symptom received sutimlimab (n = 22) or placebo (n = 20) on days 0 and 7 and then biweekly. Composite primary endpoint criteria (hemoglobin increase ‚â•1.5 g/dL at treatment assessment timepoint [mean of weeks 23, 25, 26], avoidance of transfusion, and study-prohibited CAD therapy [weeks 5-26]) were met by 16 patients (73\%) on sutimlimab, and 3 patients (15\%) on placebo (odds ratio, 15.9 [95\% confidence interval, 2.9, 88.0; P \&lt; .001]). Sutimlimab, but not placebo, significantly increased mean hemoglobin and FACIT-Fatigue scores at treatment assessment timepoint. Sutimlimab normalized mean bilirubin by week 1. Improvements correlated with near-complete inhibition of the classical complement pathway (2.3\% mean activity at week 1) and C4 normalization. Twenty-one (96\%) sutimlimab patients and 20 (100\%) placebo patients experienced ‚â•1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Headache, hypertension, rhinitis, Raynaud phenomenon, and acrocyanosis were more frequent with sutimlimab vs placebo, with a difference of ‚â•3 patients between groups. Three sutimlimab patients discontinued owing to adverse events; no placebo patients discontinued. These data demonstrate that sutimlimab has potential to be an important advancement in the treatment of CAD. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT03347422.},

  abstract = {Prognosis of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the elderly has improved during the imatinib era. We investigated dasatinib, another potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy. Patients older than age 55 years were included in the European Working Group on Adult ALL (EWALL) study number 01 for Ph+ ALL (EWALL-PH-01 international study) and were treated with dasatinib 140 mg/day (100 mg/day over 70 years) with intrathecal chemotherapy, vincristine, and dexamethasone during induction. Patients in complete remission continued consolidation with dasatinib, sequentially with cytarabine, asparaginase, and methotrexate for 6 months. Maintenance therapy was dasatinib and vincristine/dexamethasone reinductions for 18 months followed by dasatinib until relapse or death. Seventy-one patients with a median age of 69 years were enrolled; 77\% had a high comorbidity score. Complete remission rate was 96\% and 65\% of patients achieved a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels during consolidation. Only 7 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At 5 years, overall survival was 36\% and up to 45\% taking into account deaths unrelated to disease or treatment as competitors. Thirty-six patients relapsed, 24 were tested for mutation by Sanger sequencing, and 75\% were T315I-positive. BCR-ABL1T315I was tested by allele-specific oligonucleotide reverse transcriptionÔøΩ¢ñæuantitative polymerase chain reaction in 43 patients and detection was associated with short-term relapses. Ten patients (23\%) were positive before any therapy and 8 relapsed, all with this mutation. In conclusion, dasatinib combined with low-intensity chemotherapy was well-tolerated and gave long-term survival in 36\% of elderly patients with Ph+ ALL. Monitoring of BCR-ABL1T315I from diagnosis identified patients with at high risk of early relapse and may help to personalize therapy.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis of primary and secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma poses a unique set of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic challenges. During the past 10 years, there has been significant progress in the elucidation of the molecular properties of CNS lymphomas and their microenvironment, as well as evolution in the development of novel treatment strategies. Although a CNS lymphoma diagnosis was once assumed to be uniformly associated with a dismal prognosis, it is now reasonable to anticipate long-term survival, and possibly a cure, for a significant fraction of CNS lymphoma patients. The pathogenesis of CNS lymphomas affects multiple compartments within the neuroaxis, and proper treatment of the CNS lymphoma patient requires a multidisciplinary team with expertise not only in hematology/oncology but also in neurology, neuroradiology, neurosurgery, clinical neuropsychology, ophthalmology, pathology, and radiation oncology. Given the evolving principles of management and the evidence for improvements in survival, our goal is to provide an overview of current knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of CNS lymphomas and to highlight promising strategies that we believe to be most effective in establishing diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic management.},

  abstract = {Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) constitute a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, persistent peripheral blood cytopenias, and an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1 Treatment with lenalidomide has been recommended for patients with MDS and 5q deletion with symptomatic anemia and a high-transfusion burden with red blood cells (RBC) by several guidelines.2‚Äì4 Little is known about usage, chances, and challenges in daily clinical practice to comply with these guidelines. To close this informative gap an observational, multicenter, national registry, involving the whole spectrum of hematologists and oncologists from primary to tertiary health care centers in Switzerland‚Äîthe Swiss Lenalidomide in MDS del(5q)-Registry (SLIM-Registry)‚Äîwas established. The SLIM-Registry is a web-based clinical data management application. Data entry was performed retrospectively, after at least one cycle of lenalidomide has been applied, and locally by each participating center via a password-protected log-in at the website (www.slim-registry.ch). Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older and had a MDS and a del(5q) with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients were either treated with lenalidomide in the past or treatment with lenalidomide was ongoing at entry into the registry. All living patients provided written informed consent. Patients with MDS without a confirmation of del(5q) were not eligible. The SLIM-Registry was carried out according to all applicable national and local regulatory requirements. There was a regular review and verification of recorded data. From March 1, 2014, until December 31, 2019, patients were included. Data cleaning was performed thereafter, and final database lock was on October 31, 2021. Totally 83 patients (57 females, 26 males) with MDS and del(5q) have been registered in 25 health care centers across Switzerland, which included minimum 1 and maximum 10 patients per center. The majority, 63 patients (75.9\%), had a hemoglobin-level below 100 g/L. At diagnosis of MDS, in all patients, a bone marrow (BM) aspirate (with dry tap in 8 patients), and in 78 patients (94\%) additionally a BM biopsy was done. Conventional karyotyping was performed in 45 patients, both conventional karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed in 26 patients, and in 12 patients only FISH was done. In 72 patients, there was exquisitely del(5q) detected. With regard to RBC-transfusion dependence (TD) at diagnosis, 41 patients (49.4 \%) had RBC-TD with a median hemoglobin of 81 g/L (range, 50‚Äì110 g/L). In 55 patients (66.3\%), the diagnosis was myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q) according to WHO Classification 2008. Prognostic stratification was done according to IPSS, IPSS-R, and WPSS (Figure 1A‚ÄìC).Figure 1.: Prognostic scoring systems at diagnosis of MDS. (A) IPSS at diagnosis of MDS, (B) IPSS-R at diagnosis of MDS, and (C) WPSS at diagnosis of MDS. IPSS = International Prognostic Scoring System; IPSS-R = Revised International Prognostic Scoring System; MDS = myelodysplastic syndromes; WPSS = WHO Classification-based Prognostic Scoring System.In total, 1714 cycles of treatment with lenalidomide were recorded. In all patients, at least one cycle of treatment with lenalidomide was given. At start of the first cycle, median hemoglobin was 87 g/L (range, 51‚Äì119 g/L), with 45 patients (54.2\%) in need of RBC transfusions. Treatment with lenalidomide was initiated within 6 months after the diagnosis of MDS with a 5q deletion in 55 patients (66.3\%). With regard to onset and duration of treatment response, in cycle 2 of treatment with lenalidomide, 22 patients (26.5\% of the total cohort and 48.8\% of the patients with RBC-TD at treatment start) had RBC-transfusion independence (TI), another 5 (6\% and 11.1\%, respectively) each in cycle 3 and in cycle 4, 2 patients (3.6\% and 4.4\%, respectively) in cycle 5, and 1 patient (1.2\% and 2.2\%, respectively) in cycle 6. Of 61 patients with at least 6 documented treatment cycles 48 patients (78.7\%) had RBC-TI for ‚â•8 weeks. Of those, 36 patients (75\%) had a diagnosis of MDS with isolated del(5q). Analyzing those 61 patients with regard to erythroid response, there were 28 patients (45.9\%) with RBC-TD and a hemoglobin {$<$}90 g/L before start of treatment with lenalidomide, 16 patients (57.1\%) had an erythroid response, that is, a reduction of at least 4 RBC transfusions with treatment with lenalidomide over a period of 2 months. In those 43 patients with at least 12 documented treatment cycles, 34 patients (79.1\%) had RBC-TI for ‚â•26 weeks. The recommended dosage of lenalidomide 10 mg daily on days 1‚Äì21 of a 28-day cycle was administered in 21 patients (25.3\%) without adjustments. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was given in 33 patients (39.8\%). Of note, there were 5 patients with a treatment-free interval (TFI) for various reasons and durations (Suppl. Table S1). There was a patient who had a complete cytogenetic remission after 6 and after 12 cycles of treatment with lenalidomide. Therefore, treatment was stopped with regular monitoring of blood count and del(5q) by FISH. This patient remains in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission 3 years after stopping treatment. Median overall survival (OS) in a multivariate analysis was significantly longer in patients who received no RBC transfusions during the first treatment cycle of 6.7 years (95\% CI, 3.9-9.6) compared with patients who did receive RBC transfusions during that time of 3.34 years (95\% CI, 2.56-4.12; P = 0.014), and was significantly longer in patients with MDS with isolated del(5q) of 6.7 years (95\% CI, 3.0-10.4) compared with 2.4 years (95\% CI, 1.99-2.9) in other entities of MDS (P = 0.004) (Figure 2A,B). With regard to Lenalidomide-emergent adverse events, there were no new safety signals identified.Figure 2.: Median OS. (A) Kaplan-Meier curve for median OS as of start of treatment with lenalidomide according to RBC transfusions during cycle 1 of treatment with lenalidomide in 61 patients with at least 6 documented treatment cycles. There was a significant longer median OS in those 30 patients who received no RBC transfusions during the first cycle of treatment with lenalidomide of 6.7 y (95\% CI, 3.9-9.6) compared with 31 patients who did receive RBC transfusions during that time of 3.34 y (95\% CI, 2.56-4.12; P = 0.014). (B) Kaplan-Meier curve for median OS as of start of treatment with lenalidomide according to initial diagnosis of MDS. There was a significant longer median OS of 6.7 y (95\% CI, 3.0-10.4) in those 55 patients with MDS with isolated del(5q) compared with 2.4 y (95\% CI, 1.99-2.9) in 28 patients with other entities of MDS (P = 0.004). CI = confidence intervals; MDS = myelodysplastic syndromes; OS = overall survival; RBC = red blood cells.In conclusion, treatment with lenalidomide was initiated within 6 months after the diagnosis of MDS with 5q deletion in about two-thirds of patients, reflecting the uncertainty with regard to the optimal time point to start disease directed treatment, especially in patients who are not‚Äîyet‚ÄîRBC-transfusion dependent, as lenalidomide is formally approved only for patients with a transfusion-dependent anemia‚Äîand not for preventing it. In all patients, cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis was done. However, in 12 patients (14.5\%), only FISH was performed at diagnosis, which is insufficient at initial work up. A minority of patients‚Äî14.5\%‚Äîhad higher-risk disease, and treatment with lenalidomide in this patient group would not entirely be in line with current guidelines. With the start of treatment with lenalidomide, 45 patients (54.2\%) had RBC-TD, 22 of those patients (48.8\%) were free of RBC transfusions in cycle 2, with 5 patients (11.1 \%) each in cycle 3 and 4. This rapid onset of response and high efficacy with regard to RBC-TI is in line with the results of the MDS-003- and MDS-004-studies.5,6 Analyzing 61 patients with at least 6 documented cycles of lenalidomide treatment, RBC-TI for ‚â•8 weeks was more common in patients with a diagnosis of MDS with isolated del(5q) compared with other entities of MDS. Analyzing 43 patients with at least 12 documented cycles of lenalidomide treatment, 34 patients (79.1\%) had RBC-TI for ‚â•26 weeks. This confirms the high efficacy of lenalidomide with regard to RBC-TI in patients with MDS and 5q deletion also in daily clinical practice.5,6 Two months before start of treatment with lenalidomide, 25 patients (30.1\%) of the whole cohort had no RBC-TD. Although off-label, commencing disease directed treatment at that time reflects daily clinical practice of not waiting for a patient with MDS to become RBC-transfusion dependent. Whether this practice will alter the natural course of the disease and has an impact on long-term outcome is not known, as is the optimal time of starting therapy. However, interim analyses of the SINTRA-REV trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01243476) in non-TD LR MDS del(5q) patients suggest that early treatment with lenalidomide at low doses (5 mg) prolongs the time to and decreases the risk of TD with cytogenetic responses.7 This is supported by our data‚Äîalthough not corrected for disease duration and risk stratification‚Äîas patients with no RBC transfusions during the first cycle of treatment with lenalidomide had a significant improvement of median OS (P = 0.014). Renal failure in this elderly population was the most prevalent condition and is possibly the explanation for the fact, that in only 21 patients (25.3\%) the recommended lenalidomide dose was given without alterations. Diagnostic evaluation with BM analysis was done in about half of the patients who received 12 treatment cycles, in all other patients treatment with lenalidomide was continued when peripheral blood values were (near) normal without morphological BM or cytogenetic response assessment. Response assessment beyond peripheral blood values seems to be of particular importance, as deep genetic responses are possible and could potentially lead to a treatment-free remission. Clarification on when and how response assessment has to be done is necessary. And there is a clear need for defining patient and disease characteristics with the possibility of a TFI.8 Median OS is significantly longer in lenalidomide-treated patients with MDS and isolated del(5q) compared with patients with other entities of MDS. This is longer compared with the MDS-004 study, which allowed recruitment of all subgroups of patients with MDS and del(5q), including patients with additional chromosomal abnormalities and blasts in BM of up to 10\%, but all these patients had RBC-TD, which is in contrast to the SLIM-Registry.6 Observation time in our registry was too short to comment on the long-term safety of lenalidomide and on the possible occurrence of secondary malignancies. There is also a clear need for defining a diagnostic and therapeutic approach after stopping lenalidomide treatment due to intolerance or resistance to the drug with disease progression.

  abstract = {Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an ultra-rare, blood-clotting disorder. Management historically relies on plasma exchange and immunosuppression; however, a 10\%-20\% mortality rate is still observed. Caplacizumab binds to von Willebrand factor and directly inhibits platelet aggregation; addition of caplacizumab to historical treatment induced faster resolution of platelet count in clinical trials. In 2019, a modified-Delphi study was conducted with UK experts, to develop consensus statements on management of acute TTP and the potential role of caplacizumab. An unmet need was acknowledged, and areas requiring improvement included: time to diagnosis and treatment initiation; time to platelet normalisation (TTPN) during which patients remain at risk of persistent microvascular thrombosis and organ damage; and incidence of subsequent exacerbations and relapses. Caplacizumab addition to historical treatment within 24~h (after confirmatory ADAMTS13 [a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13] assay) would significantly reduce TTPN, which directly influences acute outcomes, with manageable bleeding risk and reduced burden on healthcare systems. Expert panellists agree that poor outcomes in iTTP largely result from failure to rapidly control microvascular thrombosis. Use of caplacizumab during a confirmed iTTP episode could offer better control and may plausibly improve long-term outcomes. However, this consensus must be validated with further clinical trials and robust real-world evidence.},

  abstract = {Background In the primary analysis of the pivotal JULIET trial of tisagenlecleucel, an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, the best overall response rate was 52\% and the complete response rate was 40\% in 93 evaluable adult patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. We aimed to do a long-term follow-up analysis of the clinical outcomes and correlative analyses of activity and safety in the full adult cohort. Methods In this multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial (JULIET) done at 27 treatment sites in ten countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and the USA), adult patients (‚â•18 years) with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas who were ineligible for, did not consent to, or had disease progression after autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0‚Äì1 at screening, were enrolled. Patients received a single intravenous infusion of tisagenlecleucel (target dose 5\,√ó\,108 viable transduced CAR T cells). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ie, the proportion of patients with a best overall disease response of a complete response or partial response using the Lugano classification, as assessed by an independent review committee) at any time post-infusion and was analysed in all patients who received tisagenlecleucel (the full analysis set). Safety was analysed in all patients who received tisagenlecleucel. JULIET is registered with ClinialTrials.gov, NCT02445248, and is ongoing. Findings Between July 29, 2015, and Nov 2, 2017, 167 patients were enrolled. As of Feb 20, 2020, 115 patients had received tisagenlecleucel infusion and were included in the full analysis set. At a median follow-up of 40¬∑3 months (IQR 37¬∑8‚Äì43¬∑8), the overall response rate was 53¬∑0\% (95\% CI 43¬∑5‚Äì62¬∑4; 61 of 115 patients), with 45 (39\%) patients having a complete response as their best overall response. The most common grade 3‚Äì4 adverse events were anaemia (45 [39\%]), decreased neutrophil count (39 [34\%]), decreased white blood cell count (37 [32\%]), decreased platelet count (32 [28\%]), cytokine release syndrome (26 [23\%]), neutropenia (23 [20\%]), febrile neutropenia (19 [17\%]), hypophosphataemia (15 [13\%]), and thrombocytopenia (14 [12\%]). The most common treatment-related serious adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (31 [27\%]), febrile neutropenia (seven [6\%]), pyrexia (six [5\%]), pancytopenia (three [3\%]), and pneumonia (three [3\%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Interpretation Tisagenlecleucel shows durable activity and manageable safety profiles in adult patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas. For patients with large B-cell lymphomas that are refractory to chemoimmunotherapy or relapsing after second-line therapies, tisagenlecleucel compares favourably with respect to risk‚Äìbenefit relative to conventional therapeutic approaches (eg, salvage chemotherapy).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to chemotherapy has dramatically improved outcomes of patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). When allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is performed, maintenance TKI is generally given for a fixed duration. However, the optimal duration of TKI outside of HSCT remains unknown, and the common practice is to continue indefinitely. Here, we report characteristics and outcomes of 9 patients treated with chemotherapy + TKI without HSCT and later discontinued TKI. METHODS Among 188 patients with Ph-positive ALL who did not undergo HSCT, 9 of them discontinued maintenance TKI mainly due to side effects. Patients were closely monitored with serial PCR testing for the BCR-ABL1 transcript. Major molecular response (MMR) was defined as BCR-ABL1 transcript ÔøΩÔøΩ0.1\% on the international scale for p210 transcripts and a 3-log reduction from baseline for p190 transcripts. Deep molecular remission (DMR) was defined as the absence of quantifiable BCR-ABL1 transcripts with a sensitivity of 0.01\%. Molecular relapse was defined as loss of MMR. Treatment-free remission (TFR) was defined from time of TKI discontinuation to molecular relapse, last follow-up, or death from any cause. RESULTS At the time of TKI discontinuation, transcript level was undetected in 6 patients, {$<$}0.01\% in 2 patients, and 0.01\% in another patient. Prior to discontinuation, the median duration of TKI therapy and of DMR was 70 and 47 months, respectively. No morphological relapse occurred. Three patients (33\%) had molecular relapse at a median of 6 months. All 3 resumed TKI therapy, and 2 of them regained DMR after a median of 13 months. After a median follow-up of 49 months, the median TFR was not reached, and the 4-year TFR rate was 65\%. The median duration of DMR in patients with and without molecular relapse was 22 and 58 months, respectively (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION TKI discontinuation outside of HSCT in Ph-positive ALL in the setting of compelling toxicity may be safe only among a highly selected group of patients with deep and prolonged DMR undergoing close and frequent monitoring. Validation of these findings in prospective clinical trials is highly needed.},

This study used time-dependent multivariate methodology to analyse the influence of lenalidomide therapy on overall survival (OS) and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) progression in 215 patients with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low or intermediate-1 risk and del(5q). There were significant differences in several relevant characteristics at presentation between patients receiving (n~=~86) or not receiving lenalidomide (n~=~129). The 5-year time-dependent probabilities of OS and progression to AML were 62\% and 31\% for patients receiving lenalidomide and 42\% and 25\% for patients not receiving lenalidomide; differences were not statistically significant in multivariate analysis that included all variables independently associated with those outcomes (OS, P~=~0¬∑45; risk of AML, P~=~0¬∑31, respectively). Achievement of RBC transfusion independency (P~=~0¬∑069) or cytogenetic response (P~=~0¬∑021) after lenalidomide was associated with longer OS in multivariate analysis. These data clearly show that response to lenalidomide results in a substantial clinical benefit in lower risk MDS patients with del(5q). Lenalidomide treatment does not appear to increase AML risk in this population of patients.}

METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of medical oncology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialists, and advocacy experts was convened to develop the guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on evidence published from 2017 to 2021. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 35 eligible publications. Because of the paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are based on expert consensus. RECOMMENDATIONS: The multidisciplinary team issued recommendations to aid in the recognition, workup, evaluation, and management of the most common CAR T-cell-related toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, B-cell aplasia, cytopenias, and infections. Management of short-term toxicities associated with CAR T cells begins with supportive care for most patients, but may require pharmacologic interventions for those without adequate response. Management of patients with prolonged or severe CAR T-cell-associated cytokine release syndrome includes treatment with tocilizumab with or without a corticosteroid. On the basis of the potential for rapid decline, patients with moderate to severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome should be managed with corticosteroids and supportive care.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines.},

METHODS The authors analyzed 110 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL who were enrolled in 2 consecutive, prospective, phase 2 clinical trials of frontline HCVAD with either dasatinib (63 patients) or ponatinib (47 patients). Propensity score analysis with 1:1 matching with the nearest neighbor matching method and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis based on the propensity scores were performed to assess response rates, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) between the cohorts. RESULTS Propensity score matching identified 41 patients in each cohort. With propensity score matching, the 3-year EFS rates for patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib and HCVAD plus dasatinib were 69\% and 46\%, respectively (P =.04), and the 3-year OS rates were 83\% and 56\%, respectively (P =.03). IPTW analysis using prematching cohorts demonstrated that patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib had significantly higher rates of minimal residual disease negativity by flow cytometry on day 21, complete cytogenetic response at complete response, major molecular response at complete response and at 3 months, and complete molecular response at 3 months. IPTW confirmed that treatment with HCVAD plus ponatinib was associated with longer EFS (P =.003) and OS (P =.001) compared with treatment with HCVAD plus dasatinib. CONCLUSIONS The clinical outcome of patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib appears to be superior to that of patients treated with HCVAD plus dasatinib among individuals with Ph+ ALL.

However, 25\% of patients relapse during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Methods The authors reviewed 204 patients with Ph-positive ALL who were treated between January 2001 and December 2018 using the combination of hyper-CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) plus a TKI (imatinib, 44 patients [22\%]; dasatinib, 88 patients [43\%]; or ponatinib, 72 patients [35\%]). Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start date of therapy to the date of relapse, death, or last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start date of therapy to the date of death or last follow-up. Results Overall, a 3-month CMR was observed in 57\% of patients, including 32\% of those who received imatinib, 52\% of those who received dasatinib, and 74\% of those who received ponatinib. The median follow-up was 74 months (imatinib, 180 months; dasatinib, 106 months; ponatinib, 43 months). Among 84 patients in 3-month CMR, 17 (20\%) proceeded to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 68\% and 72\%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, ponatinib therapy was the only significant favorable independent factor predicting for progression (P = .028; hazard ratio, 0.388; 95\% CI, 0.166-0.904) and death (P = .042; hazard ratio, 0.379; 95\% CI, 0.149-0.966). ASCT was not a prognostic factor for PFS and OS by univariate analysis. Conclusions In patients with Ph-positive ALL, ponatinib is superior to other types of TKIs in inducing and maintaining a CMR, thus preventing disease progression. ASCT does not improve outcome once a 3-month CMR is achieved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has distinct biological characteristics and a poorer prognosis than B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This trial aimed to reduce the rate of radiation and haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) while improving outcomes by adding nelarabine, intensified L-asparaginase, and protracted intrathecal therapy in the Berlin-Frankfurt-M√ºnster (BFM)-type treatment. METHODS: In this nationwide, multicenter, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (age {$<$}25 years at diagnosis) conducted by Japan Children's Cancer Group and Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group. Patients were stratified into standard-risk, high-risk, and very-high-risk groups according to prednisolone response, CNS status, and end-of-consolidation minimal residual disease. We used the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)-BFM-ALL 2000-backbone chemotherapy. Nelarabine (650 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) was given to high-risk and very high-risk patients. All patients received, until the measurement of end-of-consolidation minimal residual disease, an identical therapy schedule, which included the prednisolone pre-phase remission induction therapy with dexamethasone (10 mg/m2 per day, for 3 weeks [for patients {$<$}10 years] or for 2 weeks including a 7-day off interval [for patients ‚â•10 years]) instead of prednisolone, and consolidation therapy added with Escherichia coli-derived L-asparaginase. On the basis of the stratification, patients received different intensities of treatment; L-asparaginase-intensified standard BFM-type therapy for standard risk and nelarabine-added high risk BFM-type therapy for high risk. In the very high-risk group, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to group A (BFM-based block therapy) and group B (another block therapy, including high-dose dexamethasone) stratified by hospital, age (‚â•18 years or {$<$}18 years), and end-of-induction bone marrow blast percentage of M1 ({$<$}5\%) or M2 (‚â•5\%, {$<$}25\%)+M3 (‚â•25\%). Cranial radiotherapy was limited to patients with overt CNS disease at diagnosis (CNS3; {$>$}5 white blood cells per ŒºL with blasts) and patients with no evidence of CNS disease received protracted triple intrathecal therapy. Only very high-risk patients were scheduled to receive HSCT. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival for the entire cohort and the proportion of patients with disappearance of minimal residual disease between randomly assigned groups A and B in the very high-risk group. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, remission induction rate, and occurrence of adverse events. 3 years after the completion of patient accrual, a primary efficacy analysis was performed in the full analysis set and the per-protocol set. This study is registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCTs041180145. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2011, and Nov 30, 2017, of 349 eligible patients (median age 9 years [IQR 6-13]), 238 (68\%) were male, and 28 (8\%) patients had CNS3 status. 168 (48\%) patients were stratified as standard risk, 103 (30\%) as high risk, 39 (11\%) as very high risk, and 39 (11\%) as no risk (patients who had off protocol treatment before risk assessment. The composite complete remission (complete remission plus complete remission in suppression) rate after remission induction therapy was 89\% (298 of 335 patients). HSCT was performed in 35 (10\%) of 333 patients. With a median follow-up of 5¬∑2 years (IQR 3¬∑6-6¬∑7), 3-year event-free survival was 86¬∑4\% (95\% CI 82¬∑3-89¬∑7\%) and 3-year overall survival was 91¬∑3\% (87¬∑7-93¬∑8\%). The proportion of minimal residual disease disappearance was 0¬∑86 (12 of 14 patients; 95\% CI 0¬∑57-0¬∑98) in group A and 0¬∑50 (6 of 12 patients, 0¬∑21-0¬∑79) in group B. Grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy was seen in 11 (3\%) of 349 patients and sensory neuropathy was seen in 6 (2\%) patients. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse event was febrile neutropenia (294 [84\%] of 349 patients). Treatment-related death occurred in three patients due to sepsis, gastric perforation, or intracranial haemorrhage during remission induction. INTERPRETATION: The ALL-T11 protocol produced encouraging outcomes with acceptable toxicities despite limited cranial radiotherapy and HSCT use.

Recently, a new clinical-molecular prognostic model, the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M) was proposed to improve the prediction of clinical outcome of the currently available tool (Revised International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS-R]).

This was true even in those patients without detectable gene mutations. Compared with the IPSS-R based stratification, the IPSS-M risk group changed in 46\% of patients (23.6\% and 22.4\% of subjects were upstaged and downstaged, respectively).In patients treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), IPSS-M significantly improved the prediction of the risk of disease relapse and the probability of post-transplantation survival versus IPSS-R (concordance was 0.76 \emph{v} 0.60 for overall survival and 0.89 \emph{v} 0.70 for probability of relapse, respectively). In high-risk patients treated with hypomethylating agents (HMA), IPSS-M failed to stratify individual probability of response; response duration and probability of survival were inversely related to IPSS-M risk.Finally, we tested the accuracy in predicting IPSS-M when molecular information was missed and we defined a minimum set of 15 relevant genes associated with high performance of the score.{$<$}/AbstractText{$>$} {$<$}AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION"{$>$}IPSS-M improves MDS prognostication and might result in a more effective selection of candidates to HSCT. Additional factors other than gene mutations can be involved in determining HMA sensitivity.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Available treatments for older patients with primary diffuse large B-cell CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) offer progression-free survival of up to 16 months. We aimed to investigate an intensified treatment of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in older patients with PCNSL. METHODS: MARTA was a prospective, single-arm, phase 2 study done at 15 research hospitals in Germany. Patients aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed, untreated PCNSL were enrolled if they had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and were fit for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT. Induction treatment consisted of two 21-day cycles of high-dose intravenous methotrexate 3¬∑5 g/m2 (day 1), intravenous cytarabine 2 g/m2 twice daily (days 2 and 3), and intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 (days 0 and 4) followed by high-dose chemotherapy with intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 (day -8), intravenous busulfan 3¬∑2 mg/kg (days -7 and -6), and intravenous thiotepa 5 mg/kg (days -5 and -4) plus autologous HSCT. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 12 months in all patients who met eligibility criteria and started treatment. The study was registered with the German clinical trial registry, DRKS00011932, and recruitment is complete. FINDINGS: Between Nov 28, 2017, and Sept 16, 2020, 54 patients started induction treatment and 51 were included in the full analysis set. Median age was 71 years (IQR 68-75); 27 (53\%) patients were female and 24 (47\%) were male. At a median follow-up of 23¬∑0 months (IQR 16¬∑8-37¬∑4), 23 (45\%) of 51 patients progressed, relapsed, or died. 12-month progression-free survival was 58¬∑8\% (80\% CI 48¬∑9-68¬∑2; 95\% CI 44¬∑1-70¬∑9). During induction treatment, the most common grade 3-5 toxicities were thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (each in 52 [96\%] of 54 patients). During high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT, the most common grade 3-5 toxicity was leukopenia (37 [100\%] of 37 patients). Treatment-related deaths were reported in three (6\%) of 54 patients, all due to infectious complications. INTERPRETATION: Although the primary efficacy threshold was not met, short induction followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT is active in selected older patients with PCNSL and could serve as a benchmark for comparative trials.

  abstract = {Azacitidine (Aza) combined with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) is an established treatment for relapse of myeloid malignancies after allogeneic transplantation. Based on its immunomodulatory and anti-leukemic properties we considered Lenalidomide (Lena) to act synergistically with Aza/DLI to improve outcome. We, therefore, prospectively investigated tolerability and efficacy of this combination as first salvage therapy for adults with post-transplant relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Patients were scheduled for eight cycles Aza (75 mg/m2 day 1-7), Lena (2.5 or 5 mg, days 1-21) and up to three DLI with increasing T-cell dosages (0.5√ó106-1.5√ó107 cells/kg). Primary endpoint was safety, while secondary endpoints included response, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and overall survival (OS). Fifty patients with molecular (52\%) or hematological (48\%) relapse of myelodysplastic syndromes (n=24), acute myeloid leukemia (n=23) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=3) received a median of seven (range, 1-8) cycles including 14 patients with 2.5 mg and 36 with 5 mg Lena daily dosage. Concomitantly, 34 patients (68\%) received at least one DLI. Overall response rate was 56\% and 25 patients (50\%) achieved complete remission being durable in 80\%. Median OS was 21 months and 1-year OS rate 65\% with no impact of type of or time to relapse and Lena dosages. Treatment was well tolerated indicated by febrile neutropenia being the only grade ‚â•3 non-hematologic adverse event in {$>$}10\% of patients and modest acute (grade 2-4 24\%) and chronic (moderate/severe 28\%) GvHD incidences. In summary, Lena can be safely added to Aza/DLI without excess of GvHD and toxicity. Its significant anti-leukemic activity suggests that this combination is a novel salvage option for post-transplant relapse (clinicaltrials gov. Identifier: NCT02472691).}

  abstract = {Purpose The optimal regimen intensity before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. We hypothesized that lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) would result in improved overall survival (OS) compared with myeloablative conditioning (MAC). To test this hypothesis, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing MAC with RIC in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients and Methods Patients age 18 to 65 years with HCT comorbidity index \# 4 and , 5\% marrow myeloblasts pre-HCT were randomly assigned to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137) followed by HCT from HLAmatched related or unrelated donors. The primary end point was OS 18 months post‚Äìrandom assignment based on an intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary end points included relapse-free survival (RFS) and TRM. Results Planned enrollment was 356 patients; accrual ceased at 272 because of high relapse incidence with RIC versus MAC (48.3\%; 95\% CI, 39.6\% to 56.4\% and 13.5\%; 95\% CI, 8.3\% to 19.8\%, respectively; P , .001). At 18 months, OS for patients in the RIC arm was 67.7\% (95\% CI, 59.1\% to 74.9\%) versus 77.5\% (95\% CI, 69.4\% to 83.7\%) for those in the MAC arm (difference, 9.8\%; 95\% CI, 20.8\% to 20.3\%; P = .07). TRM with RIC was 4.4\% (95\% CI, 1.8\% to 8.9\%) versus 15.8\% (95\% CI, 10.2\% to 22.5\%) with MAC (P = .002). RFS with RIC was 47.3\% (95\% CI, 38.7\% to 55.4\%) versus 67.8\% (95\% CI, 59.1\% to 75\%) with MAC (P , .01). Conclusion OS was higher with MAC, but this was not statistically significant. RIC resulted in lower TRM but higher relapse rates compared with MAC, with a statistically significant advantage in RFS with MAC. These data support the use of MAC as the standard of care for fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.},

We assessed the antitumour activity and safety of lisocabtagene maraleucel, an autologous, CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product, as second-line treatment in adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma not intended for HSCT. METHODS: PILOT, an open-label, phase 2 trial done at 18 clinical sites in the USA, included adults aged 18 years or older who had relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and PET-positive disease, had received first-line therapy containing an anthracycline and a CD20-targeted agent, were not intended for HSCT by their physician, and met at least one prespecified transplantation not intended criterion. Patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy (intravenous fludarabine 30 mg/m2 and intravenous cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) followed 2-7 days later by two sequential lisocabtagene maraleucel infusions (equal target doses of CD8+ and CD4+ CAR+ T cells for a total target dose of 100\,√ó\,106 CAR+ T cells). The primary endpoint was the overall response rate and was assessed in all patients who received lisocabtagene maraleucel and had confirmed PET-positive disease before lisocabtagene maraleucel administration based on an independent review committee according to the Lugano 2014 criteria. Safety was assessed in all patients who received lisocabtagene maraleucel. Patient follow-up is ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03483103. FINDINGS: Between July 26, 2018, and Sept 24, 2021 (data cutoff for the primary analysis), 74 patients underwent leukapheresis and 61 received lisocabtagene maraleucel (efficacy and safety sets); median age was 74 years (IQR 70-78), 24 (39\%) patients were women versus 37 (61\%) men, and 54 (89\%) patients were White. 16 (26\%) of 61 patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2, 33 (54\%) had refractory disease, 13 (21\%) relapsed within 1 year of first-line therapy, and 15 (25\%) relapsed after 12 months of first-line therapy. Median on-study follow-up was 12¬∑3 months (IQR 6¬∑1-18¬∑0). 49 (80\% [95\% CI 68-89]; p{$<$}0¬∑0001) patients had an overall response. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (29 [48\%] patients), leukopenia (13 [21\%]), and thrombocytopenia (12 [20\%]). Lisocabtagene maraleucel-related serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 13 (21\%) patients. There were no treatment-related deaths. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 23 (38\%; grade 3 in one) patients and neurological events in 19 (31\%; grade 3 in three) patients, with no grade 4 events or deaths. INTERPRETATION: These results support lisocabtagene maraleucel as a potential second-line treatment in patients with large B-cell lymphoma for whom HSCT is not intended.

  abstract = {Although the majority of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be cured with standard rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), patients who fail R-CHOP have a dismal outcome. Thus, optimization of front-line therapy, as well as the development of more effective salvage strategies, remains an important objective. Advances in molecular genetics have vastly improved our understanding of the biological diversity of DLBCL and have led to the discovery of key oncogenic pathways. In addition to the major molecular designations of germinal center B-cell and activated B-cell subtypes, next-generation sequencing technologies have unveiled the remarkable complexity of DLBCL and identified unique molecular targets that may be differentially exploited for therapeutic benefit. These findings have translated into a growing list of promising novel agents. Moving forward, it is of paramount importance to recognize the heterogeneity of DLBCL and to investigate these targeted agents within patient populations who are most likely to benefit. It will be necessary to prioritize drugs that affect key driver pathways and to combine them rationally to optimize their benefit. Improved prognostication and the availability of predictive biomarkers will be crucial to allow for the possibility of individualized risk-adapted therapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with transplantation-ineligible relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) fare poorly, with limited treatment options. The antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab vedotin targets CD79b, a B-cell receptor component. METHODS: Safety and efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin with bendamustine and obinutuzumab (pola-BG) was evaluated in a single-arm cohort. Polatuzumab vedotin combined with bendamustine and rituximab (pola-BR) was compared with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) in a randomly assigned cohort of patients with transplantation-ineligible R/R DLBCL (primary end point: independent review committee [IRC] assessed complete response [CR] rate at the end of treatment). Duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. RESULTS: Pola-BG and pola-BR had a tolerable safety profile. The phase Ib/II pola-BG cohort (n = 27) had a CR rate of 29.6\% and a median OS of 10.8 months (median follow-up, 27.0 months). In the randomly assigned cohort (n = 80; 40 per arm), pola-BR patients had a significantly higher IRC-assessed CR rate (40.0\% v 17.5\%; P = .026) and longer IRC-assessed PFS (median, 9.5 v 3.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.36, 95\% CI, 0.21 to 0.63; P {$<$} .001) and OS (median, 12.4 v 4.7 months; HR, 0.42; 95\% CI, 0.24 to 0.75; P = .002; median follow-up, 22.3 months). Pola-BR patients had higher rates of grade 3-4 neutropenia (46.2\% v 33.3\%), anemia (28.2\% v 17.9\%), and thrombocytopenia (41\% v 23.1\%), but similar grade 3-4 infections (23.1\% v 20.5\%), versus the BR group. Peripheral neuropathy associated with polatuzumab vedotin (43.6\% of patients) was grade 1-2 and resolved in most patients. CONCLUSION: Polatuzumab vedotin combined with BR resulted in a significantly higher CR rate and reduced the risk of death by 58\% compared with BR in patients with transplantation-ineligible R/R DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) are syndromes of acute respiratory distress that occur within 6 hours of blood transfusion. TACO and TRALI are the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities, and specific therapies are unavailable. Diagnostically, it remains very challenging to distinguish TACO and TRALI from underlying causes of lung injury and/or fluid overload as well as from each other. TACO is characterized by pulmonary hydrostatic (cardiogenic) edema, whereas TRALI presents as pulmonary permeability edema (noncardiogenic). The pathophysiology of both syndromes is complex and incompletely understood. A 2-hit model is generally assumed to underlie TACO and TRALI disease pathology, where the first hit represents the clinical condition of the patient and the second hit is conveyed by the transfusion product. In TACO, cardiac or renal impairment and positive fluid balance appear first hits, whereas suboptimal fluid management or other components in the transfused product may enable the second hit. Remarkably, other factors beyond volume play a role in TACO. In TRALI, the first hit can, for example, be represented by inflammation, whereas the second hit is assumed to be caused by antileukocyte antibodies or biological response modifiers (eg, lipids). In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of TACO and TRALI regarding clinical definitions, diagnostic strategies, pathophysiological mechanisms, and potential therapies. More research is required to better understand TACO and TRALI pathophysiology, and more biomarker studies are warranted. Collectively, this may result in improved diagnostics and development of therapeutic approaches for these life-threatening transfusion reactions.},

  abstract = {With the improving knowledge of CML and its management, the goals of therapy need to be revisited to ensure an optimal use of the BCR::ABL1 TKIs in the frontline and later-line therapy of CML. In the frontline therapy of CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP), imatinib and the three second-generation TKIs (bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib) are associated with comparable survival results. The second-generation TKIs may produce earlier deep molecular responses, hence reducing the time to reaching a treatment-free remission (TFR). The choice of the second-generation TKI versus imatinib in frontline therapy is based on the treatment aims (survival, TFR), the CML risk, the drug cost, and the toxicity profile with respect to the patient‚Äôs comorbidities. The TKI dosing is more flexible than has been described in the registration trials, and dose adjustments can be considered both in the frontline and later-line settings (e.g., dasatinib 50\,mg frontline therapy; dose adjusted schedules of bosutinib and ponatinib), as well as during an ongoing TKI therapy to manage toxicities, before considering changing the TKI. In patients who are not candidates for TFR, BCR::ABL1 (International Scale) transcripts levels {$<$}1\% are acceptable, result in virtually similar survival as with deeper molecular remissions, and need not warrant a change of TKI. For patients with true resistance to second-generation TKIs or with the T315I gatekeeper mutation, the third-generation TKIs are preferred. Ponatinib should be considered first because of the cumulative experience and results in the CML subsets, including in T315I-mutated CML. A response-based dosing of ponatinib is safe and leads to high TKI compliance. Asciminib is a third-generation TKI with possibly a better toxicity profile, but lesser activity in T315I-mutated CML. Olverembatinib is another potent third-generation TKI with early promising results.},

Objective To determine whether dasatinib given at a daily dosage of 80 mg/m2is more effective than imatinib mesylate at a daily dosage of 300 mg/m2to improve event-free survival of children with Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive ALL in the context of intensive chemotherapy without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Design, Setting, and Participants This open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted at 20 hospitals in China. Enrollment occurred from January 1, 2015, through September 18, 2018, and randomization was stopped on October 4, 2018, when the early stopping criterion of the trial was met. Patients aged 0 to 18 years were recruited. Of the 225 patients with the diagnosis, 35 declined participation and 1 died before treatment, leaving 189 patients available for analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1 through August 4, 2019. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive daily dasatinib (nÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ92) or imatinib (nÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ97) continuously for the entire duration of ALL therapy from the time of diagnosis made during remission induction to the end of continuation therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was event-free survival, analyzed based on intention to treat. The secondary outcomes were relapse, death due to toxic effects, and overall survival. Results Among the 189 participants (136 male [72.0\%]; median age, 7.8 [interquartile range (IQR), 5.2-11.3] years) and a median follow-up of 26.4 (IQR, 16.3-34.1) months, the 4-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 71.0\% (95\% CI, 56.2\%-89.6\%) and 88.4\% (95\% CI, 81.3\%-96.1\%), respectively, in the dasatinib group and 48.9\% (95\% CI, 32.0\%-74.5\%;PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.005, log-rank test) and 69.2\% (95\% CI, 55.6\%-86.2\%;PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.04, log-rank test), respectively, in the imatinib group. The 4-year cumulative risk of any relapse was 19.8\% (95\% CI, 4.2\%-35.4\%) in the dasatinib group and 34.4\% (95\% CI, 15.6\%-53.2\%) in the imatinib group (PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.01, Gray test), whereas the 4-year cumulative risk of an isolated central nervous system relapse was 2.7\% (95\% CI, 0.0\%-8.1\%) in the dasatinib group and 8.4\% (95\% CI, 1.2\%-15.6\%) in the imatinib group (PÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ.06, Gray test). There were no significant differences in the frequency of severe toxic effects between the 2 treatment groups. Conclusions and Relevance Intensive chemotherapy including dasatinib at a dosage of 80 mg/m2per day yielded superior results in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive ALL compared with imatinib mesylate at a dosage of 300 mg/m2per day and provided excellent control of central nervous system leukemia without the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation.

We evaluated the prognostic impact of individual ACAs in 152 patients with Ph+ ALL receiving first-line intensive chemotherapy plus either imatinib (n=36), dasatinib (n=74) or ponatinib (n=42). ACAs were identified in 118 patients (78\%). Compared to outcomes of patients without ACAs, ACAs were not associated with differences in either relapse-free survival (RFS; P=0.42) or overall survival (OS; P=0.51). When individual ACAs were evaluated, +der(22)t(9;22) and/or -9/9p in the absence of high hyperdiploidy (HeH) was present in 16\% of patients and constituted a poor-risk ACA group. Patients with 1 or more poor-risk ACA in the absence of HeH had significantly shorter RFS (5-year RFS rate 33\% versus 59\%, P=0.01) and OS (5-year OS rate 24\% versus 63\%, P=0.003). Poor-risk ACAs were prognostic in patients who received imatinib and dasatinib but not in those who received ponatinib. By multivariate analysis, this poor-risk ACA group was independently associated with worse RFS (HR 2.03 [95\% CI 1.08-3.30], P=0.03) and OS (HR 2.02 [95\% CI 1.10-3.71], P=0.02).

  abstract = {Background: Ponatinib and blinatumomab are both highly effective therapies for Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The combination of these two agents may offer an effective chemotherapy-free strategy in these patients (pts). Aims: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ponatinib and blinatumomab in pts with newly diagnosed (ND), relapsed/refractory (R/R) Ph+ ALL or CML in lymphoid blast phase (CML-LBP). For pts with ND Ph+ ALL, the primary endpoint was the complete molecular response (CMR) rate. For pts with R/R Ph+ ALL, the primary endpoint was the CR/CRi rate. Secondary endpoints included safety, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods: In this phase II study, adults with ND Ph+ ALL, R/R Ph+ ALL, or CML-LBP were eligible. Pts were required to have a performance status of ÔøΩÔøΩ2, total bilirubin ÔøΩÔøΩ2x the upper limit of normal (ULN), and ALT and AST ÔøΩÔøΩ3x the ULN. Pts with uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or clinically significant central nervous system (CNS) comorbidities (except for CNS leukemia) were excluded. Pts received up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab as a continuous infusion at standard doses. Ponatinib 30mg daily was given during cycle 1 and was decreased to 15mg daily once CMR was achieved. After 5 cycles of blinatumomab, ponatinib was continued for at least 5 years. Twelve doses of prophylactic IT chemotherapy with alternating cytarabine and methotrexate were administered. Results: Between 2/2018 to 1/2022, 55 pts were treated (35 with ND Ph+ ALL, 14 with R/R Ph+ ALL and 6 with CML-LBP). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Among the 35 pts with ND Ph+ ALL, 12 were in CR at enrollment (including 2 pts in CMR). 22 of the 23 evaluable pts (96\%) achieved CR/CRi. One pt died on day 18 from intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of chemotherapy administered prior to enrollment. After one cycle, 21/33 pts (64\%) achieved CMR, and 28/33 pts (85\%) achieved CMR at any time. 11 of 15 tested pts (73\%) also became MRD-negative by an NGS assay with sensitivity of 1x10-6. CR/CRi was achieved in 12/13 (92\%) evaluable pts with R/R Ph+ ALL. CMR was achieved in 10 pts (71\%) after cycle 1 and in 11 pts (79\%) overall. 5 of 6 pts with CML-LBP achieved CR/CRi, and 1 pt achieved PR as best response. 2 pts (40\%) achieved CMR. In the ND Ph+ ALL cohort, 1 of 34 pts who received at least 1 full cycle died in CR; the other 33 are in ongoing hematologic remission. Only one pt underwent stem cell transplant (SCT) in first remission for persistently detectable BCR/ABL1 transcripts. Among 13 responding pts in the R/R Ph+ ALL cohort, 6 proceeded to SCT, 4 did not undergo SCT and subsequently relapsed, 1 died in CR, and 2 are in ongoing remission without SCT. In the CML-LBP cohort, 3 of the 5 responding pts subsequently relapsed. The median follow-up is 11 months (range, 1-46+). For ND Ph+ ALL, the 2-year EFS and OS are both 93\% (Figure 2). There were no relapses or leukemia-related deaths in this cohort. In the R/R Ph+ ALL cohort, the 2-year EFS rate was 42\% and the 2-year OS rate was 61\%. In the CML-LBP cohort, the 2-year EFS was 33\% and the 2-year OS was 60\%. The treatment was well-tolerated, and most toxicities were grade 1-2 and consistent with the known toxicities of the two agents. Two pts discontinued ponatinib due to toxicity (1 due to stroke and 1 due to DVT). One pt discontinued blinatumomab due to persistent grade 2 tremor. Image:Summary/Conclusion: The chemotherapy-free regimen of simultaneous ponatinib and blinatumomab is safe and effective in pts with Ph+ ALL. For pts with ND Ph+ ALL, SCT does not appear to be needed in first remission.},

In relapse samples harboring a TKI-resistant ABL1 mutation, the corresponding mutation could not be detected pretreatment, despite validated sequencing sensitivity of Duplex Sequencing down to 0.005\%. In samples under the selective pressure of ongoing TKI therapy, we detected low-level, emerging resistance mutations up to 5 months prior to relapse. These findings suggest that pretreatment ABL1 mutation assessment should not guide upfront TKI selection in PhÔøΩÔøΩ+ÔøΩ°ÖÖLL, although serial testing while on TKI therapy may allow for early detection of clinically actionable resistant clones.},

Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5\% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4\% to 6\% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9\% to 8.2\% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5\% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17\% in 2004 to 28\% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21\% to 31\%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.},

However, recent evidence demonstrating differential responses to chemotherapy raise the possibility that T-LLy and T-ALL are distinct clinical and biologic entities. Here, we examine differences between the 2 diseases and use illustrative cases to highlight key recommendations on how to best treat patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory T-LLy. We discuss results of recent clinical trials incorporating use of nelarabine and~bortezomib, choice of induction steroid, role of cranial radiotherapy, and risk stratification markers to identify patients at highest risk of relapse and to further refine current treatment strategies. Because prognosis for relapsed or~refractory T-LLy patients is poor, we discuss ongoing investigations incorporating novel therapies, including immunotherapeutics, into upfront and salvage regimens and the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.},

UPDATE METHODOLOGY: The Update Committee completed a review and analysis of pertinent data published from 1999 through September 2005. Guided by the 1996 ASCO clinical outcomes criteria, the Update Committee formulated recommendations based on improvements in survival, quality of life, toxicity reduction and cost-effectiveness. RECOMMENDATIONS: The 2005 Update Committee agreed unanimously that reduction in febrile neutropenia (FN) is an important clinical outcome that justifies the use of CSFs, regardless of impact on other factors, when the risk of FN is approximately 20\% and no other equally effective regimen that does not require CSFs is available. Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of FN in patients who are at high risk based on age, medical history, disease characteristics, and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen. CSF use allows a modest to moderate increase in dose-density and/or dose-intensity of chemotherapy regimens. Dose-dense regimens should only be used within an appropriately designed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data. Prophylactic CSF for patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma aged 65 years and older treated with curative chemotherapy (CHOP or more aggressive regimens) should be given to reduce the incidence of FN and infections. Current recommendations for the management of patients exposed to lethal doses of total body radiotherapy, but not doses high enough to lead to certain death due to injury to other organs, includes the prompt administration of CSF or pegylated G-CSF.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred sixty-eight patients with advanced-stage FL received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide, and prednisone (CHVP) monthly for 6 months, then every 2 months for 12 months. After randomization, 242 patients were evaluated for efficacy: 119 received CHVP alone, and 123 also received IFNalpha at a dose of 5 million units three times weekly for 18 months. RESULTS: After a 6-year median follow-up, the patients treated with CHVP + IFNalpha showed significantly longer median PFS than those who received CHVP alone (2.9 years v 1.5 years, respectively; P = .0002) and significantly longer median OS (not reached v 5.6 years, respectively; P = .008). Although some side effects, which included neutropenia, asthenia, fever, elevated serum transaminase levels, flu-like symptoms, and thrombocytopenia, were more frequently observed in patients who received the combination regimen, these reactions were moderate. IFNalpha was withdrawn because of toxicity in 10\% of the patients, and a dosage reduction or temporary suspension was required in 28\%. CONCLUSION: With long-term follow-up of 6 years, these results confirm that the addition of IFNalpha to a doxorubicin-containing regimen for patients with advanced-stage and clinically aggressive FL not only increased PFS, as in most other similar trials, but also prolonged OS. Toxicity was moderate. The beneficial effects of this combined chemotherapy and IFNalpha regimen on OS probably reflect the selection of FL patients with poor prognostic factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) frequently relapse on imatinib with acquisition of BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations. To analyze the changes that second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have brought in mutation frequency and type, a database review was undertaken of the results of all the BCR-ABL KD mutation analyses performed in the authors' laboratory from January 2004 to January 2013. METHODS Interrogation of the database retrieved 450 mutation analyses in 272 patients with Ph+ ALL. Prescreening of samples was performed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC), followed by direct sequencing of D-HPLCÔøΩ¢ñØositive cases. RESULTS BCR-ABL KD mutations were detected in 70\% of imatinib-resistant patients, with T315I, E255K, and Y253H mutations accounting for 75\% of cases. Seventy-eight percent of the patients reported to be resistant to second-generation TKIs after imatinib failure were positive for mutations, and 58\% of them had multiple mutations. Analysis of patients relapsing on dasatinib revealed a newly acquired T315I mutation in almost two-thirds of the cases. Direct sequencing detected no mutations at diagnosis, even in patients who relapsed after a few months. CONCLUSIONS Second-generation TKIs ensure a more rapid debulking of the leukemic clone and have much fewer insensitive mutations, but long-term disease control remains a problem, and the T315I mutation is revealed to be an even more frequent enemy. BCR-ABL KD mutation screening of patients with Ph+ ALL who are receiving imatinib or second-generation TKIs would be a precious ally for timely treatment optimization. In contrast, the clinical usefulness of conventional direct sequencing at diagnosis seems to be very low. Cancer 2014;120:1002ÔøΩÔøΩ1009. Á©¢ 2013 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {Background In patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, resistance to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is frequent and most often associated with the development of point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. We aimed to assess: (i) in how many patients BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are already detectable at relatively low levels at the time of diagnosis, and (ii) whether mutation detection correlates with subsequent response to therapy.Design and Methods We retrospectively analyzed samples collected at diagnosis from 15 patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who subsequently received tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (dasatinib) by cloning the BCR-ABL kinase domain in a bacterial vector and sequencing 200 independent clones per sample.Results Mutations at relatively low levels (2ÔøΩÔøΩ4 clones out of 200) could be detected in all patients ÔøΩÔøΩ eight who relapsed and seven who achieved persistent remission. Each patient had evidence of two to eight different mutations, the majority of which have never been reported in association with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In two patients out of six who relapsed because of a mutation, the mutation (a T315I) was already detectable in a few clones at the time of diagnosis. On the other hand, a patient who was found to harbor an F317L mutation is in persistent remission on dasatinib.Conclusions Our results suggest that the BCR-ABL kinase domain is prone to randomly accumulate point mutations in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, although the presence of these mutations in a relatively small leukemic subclone does not always preclude a primary response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.},

With the advent of megavolt equipment and very extensive treatment fields, cure became a reality for most patients with localized disease. However, with the advent of effective chemotherapy, the role of radiotherapy has changed. Modern advanced radiotherapy technology is now implemented to enable the use of limited radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy to maximize the chance of cure while minimizing long-term complications.},

Uncovering the exposure relationships that provide selective advantage to specific CH mutations is critical to understanding the pathogenesis and etiology of t-MNs. In a systematic analysis of 416~patients with t-MN and detailed prior exposure history, we found that TP53 mutations were significantly associated with prior treatment with thalidomide analogs, specifically lenalidomide. We demonstrated experimentally that lenalidomide treatment provides a selective advantage to Trp53-mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in~vitro and in~vivo, the effect of which was specific to Trp53-mutant HSPCs and was not observed in HSPCs with other CH mutations. Because of the differences in CK1Œ± degradation, pomalidomide treatment did not provide an equivalent level of selective advantage to Trp53-mutant HSPCs, providing a biological rationale for its use in patients at high risk for t-MN. These findings highlight the role of lenalidomide treatment in promoting TP53-mutated t-MNs and offer a potential alternative strategy to mitigate the risk of t-MN development.}

Currently, chemical analysis of needle biopsy specimens is the most common accepted method of measurement. This study presents a readily available noninvasive method of measuring and imaging LICs in vivo using clinical 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging units. Mean liver proton transverse relaxation rates (R2) were measured for 105 humans. A value for the LIC for each subject was obtained by chemical assay of a needle biopsy specimen. High degrees of sensitivity and specificity of R2 to biopsy LICs were found at the clinically significant LIC thresholds of 1.8, 3.2, 7.0, and 15.0 mg Fe/g dry tissue. A calibration curve relating liver R2 to LIC has been deduced from the data covering the range of LICs from 0.3 to 42.7 mg Fe/g dry tissue. Proton transverse relaxation rates in aqueous paramagnetic solutions were also measured on each magnetic resonance imaging unit to ensure instrument-independent results. Measurements of proton transverse relaxivity of aqueous MnCl2 phantoms on 13 different magnetic resonance imaging units using the method yielded a coefficient of variation of 2.1\%.},

We examined outcomes associated with IST and predictors of benefit in a large international cohort of patients with MDS. Data were collected from 15 centers in the United States and Europe. Responses, including red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (TI), were assessed based on the 2006 MDS International Working Group criteria, and overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Logistic regression models estimated odds for response and TI, and Cox Proportional Hazard models estimated hazards ratios for OS. We identified 207 patients with MDS receiving IST, excluding steroid monotherapy. The most common IST regimen was anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) plus prednisone (43\%). Overall response rate (ORR) was 48.8\%, including 11.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.5\%-18.4\%) who achieved a complete remission and 30\% (95\% CI, 22.3\%-39.5\%) who achieved RBC TI. Median OS was 47.4 months (95\% CI, 37-72.3 months) and was longer for patients who achieved a response or TI. Achievement of RBC TI was associated with a hypocellular bone marrow (cellularity {$<$} 20\%); horse ATG plus cyclosporine was more effective than rabbit ATG or ATG without cyclosporine. Age, transfusion dependence, presence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or large granular lymphocyte clones, and HLA DR15 positivity did not predict response to IST. IST leads to objective responses in nearly half the selected patients with the highest rate of RBC TI achieved in patients with hypocellular bone marrows.}

Fixed and Random-effects models were used to pool response rates. We identified nine prospective cohort studies and 13 clinical trials with a total of 570 patients. Overall response rate was 42.5\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 36.1-49.2\%] including a complete remission rate of 12.5\% (95\%CI: 9.3-16.6\%) and red blood cell transfusion independence rate of 33.4\% (95\% CI: 25.1‚Äì42.9\%). The most commonly used forms of IST were anti-thymocyte globulin alone or in combination with cyclosporin A with a trend towards higher response rates with combination therapy. Progression rate to acute myeloid leukemia was 8.6\% per patient year (95\%CI: 3.3-13.9\%). Overall survival and adverse events were only inconsistently reported. We were unable to validate any biomarkers predictive of a therapeutic response to IST.

  abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells with a clinical course characterized by multiple relapses and treatment refractoriness. While recent treatment advancements have extended overall survival (OS), refractory MM has a poor prognosis, with a median OS of between 4 and 6 months. Nuclear export inhibition, specifically inhibition of CRM1/XPO1, is an emerging novel treatment modality that has shown promise in treatment-refractory MM. Initially discovered in yeast in 1983, early clinical applications were met with significant toxicities that limited their utility. The creation of small molecule inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) has improved on toxicity limitations and has led to investigation in a number of malignancies at the preclinical and clinical stages. Preclinical studies of SINEs in MM have shown that~these molecules are cytotoxic to myeloma cells, play a role in therapy resensitization, and suggest a role in limiting bone disease progression. In July 2019, selinexor became the first nuclear export inhibitor approved for use in relapsed/refractory MM based on the STORM trial. As of May 2020, there were eight ongoing trials combining selinexor with standard treatment regimens in relapsed/refractory MM. Eltanexor, a second-generation SINE, is also under investigation and has shown preliminary signs of efficacy in an early clinical trial while potentially having~an improved toxicity profile compared with selinexor. Results in ongoing trials will help further define the role of SINEs in MM.},

  abstract = {Inherited haemoglobin disorders, including thalassaemia and sickle-cell disease, are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide. Several clinical forms of Œ±-thalassaemia and Œ≤-thalassaemia, including the co-inheritance of Œ≤-thalassaemia with haemoglobin E resulting in haemoglobin E/Œ≤-thalassaemia, have been described. The disease hallmarks include imbalance in the Œ±/Œ≤-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic haemolytic anaemia, compensatory haemopoietic expansion, hypercoagulability, and increased intestinal iron absorption. The complications of iron overload, arising from transfusions that represent the basis of disease management in most patients with severe thalassaemia, might further complicate the clinical phenotype. These pathophysiological mechanisms lead to an array of clinical manifestations involving numerous organ systems. Conventional management primarily relies on transfusion and iron-chelation therapy, as well as splenectomy in specific cases. An increased understanding of the molecular and pathogenic factors that govern the disease process have suggested routes for the development of new therapeutic approaches that address the underlying chain imbalance, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron dysregulation, with several agents being evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Zanubrutinib is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). In this first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study, patients in part 1 (3\,+\,3 dose escalation) had relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies and received zanubrutinib 40, 80, 160, or 320 mg once daily or 160 mg twice daily. Part 2 (expansion) consisted of disease-specific cohorts, including treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The primary end points were safety and tolerability, and definition of the maximum tolerated dose (part 1). Additional end points included pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy. Reported herein are results from 144 patients enrolled in the dose-finding and CLL/SLL cohorts. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred in dose escalation. Median BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was {$>$}95\% at all doses. Sustained complete ({$>$}95\%) BTK occupancy in lymph node biopsy specimens was more frequent with 160 mg twice daily than 320 mg once daily (89\% vs 50\%; P = .0342). Consequently, 160 mg twice daily was selected for further investigation. With median follow-up of 13.7 months (range, 0.4-30.5 months), 89 CLL/SLL patients (94.7\%) remain on study. Most toxicities were grade 1/2; neutropenia was the only grade 3/4 toxicity observed in {$>$}2 patients. One patient experienced a grade 3 subcutaneous hemorrhage. Among 78 efficacy-evaluable CLL/SLL patients, the overall response rate was 96.2\% (95\% confidence interval, 89.2-99.2). Estimated progression-free survival at 12 months was 100\%. Zanubrutinib demonstrated encouraging activity in CLL/SLL patients, with a low incidence of major toxicities. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT02343120.},

The phase 3 ASPEN study compared the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib, a first-generation BTK inhibitor, with zanubrutinib, a novel highly selective BTK inhibitor, in patients with WM. Patients with MYD88L265P disease were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with ibrutinib or zanubrutinib. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or a very good partial response (VGPR) by independent review. Key secondary end points included major response rate (MRR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), disease burden, and safety. A total of 201 patients were randomized, and 199 received ‚â•1 dose of study treatment. No patient achieved a CR. Twenty-nine (28\%) zanubrutinib patients and 19 (19\%) ibrutinib patients achieved a VGPR, a nonstatistically significant difference (P = .09). MRRs were 77\% and 78\%, respectively. Median DOR and PFS were not reached; 84\% and 85\% of ibrutinib and zanubrutinib patients were progression free at 18 months. Atrial fibrillation, contusion, diarrhea, peripheral edema, hemorrhage, muscle spasms, and pneumonia, as well as adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, were less common among zanubrutinib recipients. Incidence of neutropenia was higher with zanubrutinib, although grade ‚â•3 infection rates were similar in both arms (1.2 and 1.1 events per 100 person-months). These results demonstrate that zanubrutinib and ibrutinib are highly effective in the treatment of WM, but zanubrutinib treatment was associated with a trend toward better response quality and less toxicity, particularly cardiovascular toxicity.},

Here, we present the implementation of the Molecular Tumor Board Portal (MTBP), an academic clinical decision support system developed under the umbrella of Cancer Core Europe that creates a unified legal, scientific and technological platform to share and harness next-generation sequencing data. Automating the interpretation and reporting of sequencing results decrease the need for time-consuming manual procedures that are prone to errors. The adoption of an expert-agreed process to systematically link tumor molecular profiles with clinical actions promotes consistent decision-making and structured data capture across the connected centers. The use of information-rich patient reports with interactive content facilitates collaborative discussion of complex cases during virtual molecular tumor board meetings. Overall, streamlined digital systems like the MTBP are crucial to better address the challenges brought by precision oncology and accelerate the use of emerging biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Background: The present standard induction treatment for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (ND AML) is three days' daunorubicin or idarubicin plus seven days' cytarabine chemotherapy (3+7). Venetoclax plus azacytidine or low dose cytarabine is effective and better than azacitidine or low dose cytarabine alone for ND AML in VIALE A and VIALE C trials, respectively and the outcome by Venetoclax dose levels was not different between 400 mg, 800 mg, or 1200 mg a day. As a strong CYP3A inhibitor, posaconazole can increase serum level of Venetoclax and the dosage could be reduced to 75\textasciitilde 100mg a day.Method: We treat ND AML patients with uninterrupted Venetoclax 100 mg plus posaconazole 300 mg daily and 7 days' standard dose of cytarabine (100 mg/m2/day) or 7 days' azacitidine (75 mg/m2/d), followed by 5 days' consolidation cytarabine (100 mg/m2/d) or another 7 days' azacitidine, and then followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Results: Eight patients have enrolled the treatment including 7 underwent venetoclax/posaconazole/cytarabine and one venetoclax/posaconazole/azacitidine patients and four patients are secondary AML (one myeloma, one MDS, and 2 breast cancer patients). All patients were hematologic complete remission achieved in one month and 6 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation including one from matched sibling, two from matched unrelated, and three from haplo-identical donors (sons). Febrile neutropenia rates were similar to 3+7 treatment patients on historical comparison but shorter period of febrile illness. There was no grade II or higher adverse effect of oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract as compared with conventional 3+7 therapy. Two out of six allo-transplant patients got leukemia relapse then salvage treatment ensued and the other 2 non-transplant and 4 allo-transplant patients are persisted in complete remission.Conclusion: Venetoclax plus posaconazole and standard dose cytarabine is a feasible choice of induction therapy in ND AML and high CR rate and transplant rate achieved and there was no detrimental effect upon the hematopoietic recovery during induction and transplant therapy.FigureNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

Using comprehensive molecular profiling data from 3,653 patients we characterize and validate 16 molecular classes describing 100\% of AML patients. Each class represents diverse biological AML subgroups, and is associated with distinct clinical presentation, likelihood of response to induction chemotherapy, risk of relapse and death over time. Secondary AML-2, emerges as the second largest class (24\%), associates with high-risk disease, poor prognosis irrespective of flow Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, and derives significant benefit from transplantation. Guided by class membership we derive a 3-tier risk-stratification score that re-stratifies 26\% of patients as compared to standard of care. This results in a unified framework for disease classification and risk-stratification in AML that relies on information from cytogenetics and 32 genes.

  abstract = {Low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including refractory anemia and sideroblastic anemia, are characterized by increased apoptotic death of erythroid progenitors. The signaling pathways that elicit this pathologic cell death in MDS have, however, remained unclear. Treatment with erythropoietin in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may synergistically improve the anemia in patients with MDS, with a concomitant decrease in the number of apoptotic bone marrow precursors. Moreover, we have previously reported that G-CSF inhibits Fas-induced caspase activation in sideroblastic anemia (RARS). The present data demonstrate that almost 50\% of erythroid progenitor cells derived from patients with MDS exhibit spontaneous release of cytochrome c from mitochondria with ensuing activation of caspase-9, whereas normal erythroid progenitors display neither of these features. G-CSF significantly inhibited cytochrome c release and suppressed apoptosis, most noticeably in cells from patients with sideroblastic anemia. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-9 suppressed both spontaneous and Fas-mediated apoptosis of erythroid progenitors in all low-risk MDS cases studied. We propose that the increased sensitivity of MDS progenitor cells to death receptor stimulation is due to a constitutive activation of the mitochondrial axis of the apoptotic signaling pathway in these cells. These studies yield a mechanistic explanation for the beneficial clinical effects of growth factor administration in patients with MDS, and provide a model for the study of growth factor‚Äìmediated suppression of apoptosis in other bone marrow disorders.}

Due to the broad range of currently available treatments for PCNSL, comparability in long-term follow-up studies is limited, and data are scattered across small studies. METHODS: In this study, we report the long-term survival of patients with newly diagnosed immunocompetent PCNSL, enrolled in a phase II trial from June 2005 to September 2011. Patients were treated using rituximab, methotrexate, vincristine, and procarbazine (R-MVP) chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in those with partial or complete response to R-MVP. In a post hoc analysis, clinical and imaging features were evaluated in those still alive. RESULTS: 26 of 32 patients underwent HDC-ASCT consolidation. Of them, 3 patients died of treatment-related toxicity and 2 due to disease progression within 1 year of ASCT. None of the remaining 21 patients had disease progression with a median follow-up of 12.1 years and were included in the analysis. Compared with the post-HDC-ASCT assessment, at the last follow-up, there was no significant difference in the median Karnofsky Performance Status (80 [range: 60-100] vs 90 [range: 70-100]), the median Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology score (1 [range: 0-4] vs 1 [range: 0-5]), and leukoencephalopathy score (1 [range: 0-3] vs 1 [range: 1-4]). DISCUSSION: Long-term follow-up demonstrated that treatment was well tolerated in most patients enrolled in this study, with stable leukoencephalopathy on imaging and stable clinical performance status. Disease recurrence was not observed beyond 2 years after HDC-ASCT consolidation.},

Single-agent epcoritamab previously demonstrated potent antitumor activity in dose escalation across B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the dose-expansion cohort of a phase I/II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03625037), adults with relapsed or refractory CD20+ large B-cell lymphoma and at least two prior therapy lines (including anti-CD20 therapies) received subcutaneous epcoritamab in 28-day cycles (once weekly step-up doses in weeks 1-3 of cycle 1, then full doses once weekly through cycle 3, once every 2 weeks in cycles 4-9, and once every 4 weeks in cycle 10 and thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was overall response rate by the independent review committee. RESULTS: As of January 31, 2022, 157 patients were treated (median age, 64 years [range, 20-83]; median of three [range, 2-11] prior therapy lines; primary refractory disease: 61.1\%; prior chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell exposure: 38.9\%). At a median follow-up of 10.7 months, the overall response rate was 63.1\% (95\% CI, 55.0 to 70.6) and the complete response rate was 38.9\% (95\% CI, 31.2 to 46.9). The median duration of response was 12.0 months (among complete responders: not reached). Overall and complete response rates were similar across key prespecified subgroups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (49.7\%; grade 1 or 2: 47.1\%; grade 3: 2.5\%), pyrexia (23.6\%), and fatigue (22.9\%). Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 6.4\% of patients with one fatal event. CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous epcoritamab resulted in deep and durable responses and manageable safety in highly refractory patients with large B-cell lymphoma, including those with prior CAR T-cell exposure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy with that of autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched eligible publications up to January 31st, 2022, in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Springer, and Scopus. A total of 16 publications with 3484 patients were independently evaluated and analyzed using STATA SE software. RESULTS: Patients who underwent CAR-T cell therapy showed a better overall response rate (ORR) and partial response (PR) than those treated with auto-HSCT (CAR-T vs. auto-HSCT, ORR: 80\% vs. 73\%, HR:0.90,95\%CI:0.76-1.07,P = 0.001; PR: 20\% vs. 14\%, HR:0.65,95\%CI:0.62-0.68,P = 0.034). No significant difference was observed in 6-month overall survival (OS) (CAR-T vs. auto-HSCT, six-month OS: 81\% vs. 84\%, HR:1.23,95\%CI:0.63-2.38, P = 0.299), while auto-HSCT showed a favorable 1 and 2-year OS (CAR-T vs. auto-HSCT, one-year OS: 64\% vs. 73\%, HR:2.42,95\%CI:2.27-2.79, P {$<$} 0.001; two-year OS: 54\% vs. 68\%, HR:1.81,95\%CI:1.78-1.97, P {$<$} 0.001). Auto-HSCT also had advantages in progression-free survival (PFS) (CAR-T vs. auto-HSCT, six-month PFS: 53\% vs. 76\%, HR:2.81,95\%CI:2.53-3.11,P {$<$} 0.001; one-year PFS: 46\% vs. 61\%, HR:1.84,95\%CI:1.72-1.97,P {$<$} 0.001; two-year PFS: 42\% vs. 54\%, HR:1.62,95\%CI:1.53-1.71, P {$<$} 0.001). Subgroup analysis by age, prior lines of therapy, and ECOG scores was performed to compare the efficacy of both treatment modalities. CONCLUSION: Although CAR-T cell therapy showed a beneficial ORR, auto-HSCT exhibited a better long-term treatment superiority in R/R DLBCL patients. Survival outcomes were consistent across different subgroups.},

  abstract = {The acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is a bleeding disorder that is frequently unrecognized or is misdiagnosed as von Willebrand disease. AVWS is characterized by structural or functional defects of von Willebrand factor (VWF) that are secondary to autoimmune, lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative, malignant, cardiovascular, or other disorders. VWF abnormalities in these disorders can result from (1) antibody-mediated clearance or functional interference, (2) adsorption to surfaces of transformed cells or platelets, or (3) increased shear stress and subsequent proteolysis. Diagnosis can be challenging as no single test is usually sufficient to prove or exclude AVWS. Furthermore, there are no evidence-based guidelines for management. Treatments of the underlying medical condition, including chemo/radiotherapy, surgery, or immunosuppressants can result in remission of AVWS, but is not always feasible and successful. Because of the heterogeneous mechanisms of AVWS, more than one therapeutic approach is often required to treat acute bleeds and for prophylaxis during invasive procedures; the treatment options include, but are not limited to, desmopressin, VWF-containing concentrates, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis or recombinant factor VIIa. Here, we review the management of AVWS with an overview on the currently available evidence and additional considerations for typical treatment situations.},

  abstract = {Recognition of HLA incompatibilities by the immune system represents a major barrier to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HLA genotypically identical sibling donors are, therefore, the gold standard for transplantation purposes, but only 30\% patients have such a donor. For the remaining 70\% patients alternative sources of stem cells are a matched unrelated adult volunteer donor, a haploidentical donor or a cord blood unit. The definition of ‚ÄòHLA matching‚Äô depends on the level of resolution and on which loci are tested. The development of HLA molecular typing technologies and the availability of more than 27 million donors in the international database has greatly facilitated unrelated donor searches. The gold standard is high resolution typing at the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 loci (10/10 match). Single disparities for HLA-A, -B, - C, or -DRB1 are associated with increased risk of post-transplant complications, but less so in patients with advanced disease, and in those undergoing T-cell-depleted allografting. HLA-DQB1 mismatches seem to be better tolerated and some HLA-C, -DRB1 and -DPB1 disparities are potentially less immunogenic. HLA typing by next-generation sequencing methods is likely to change matching algorithms by providing full sequence information on all HLA loci in a single step. In most European populations a 10/10 matched donor can be found for at least 50\% of patients and an additional 20‚Äì30\% patients may have a 9/10 matched donor. Genetic factors that help in identifying donors with less immunogenic mismatches are discussed. Haploidentical donors are increasingly used as an alternative source of stem cells for those patients lacking a matched unrelated donor.},

  abstract = {Background: One third of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Early detection of impending relapse would enable pre-emptive treatment and potentially reduce relapse risk but is limited by the lack of sensitive markers for measurable residual disease (MRD). We developed a pipeline where patient-specific mutations, as determined by a myeloid next generation sequencing (NGS) panel are tracked using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Aims: To evaluate if personalized MRD detection by ddPCR can predict clinical relapse earlier than conventional methods. Methods: The prospective study (NCT02872662) enrolled patients with MDS, MDS/MPN or MDS-AML with {$<$} 30\% marrow blasts undergoing HCT. Patients were included before HCT, and serial bone marrow (BM) samples were collected every third month post-HCT for 2 years. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected monthly. MRD results were not available for the treating physician. Results: We screened 286 pts between 2016 and 2020, whereof 20 were excluded mainly due to lack of genetic aberration or no HCT performed. 266 pts were included from 12 HCT centers. Median age was 64 (18-78) years and 59\% were male. Myeloid panel NGS screening identified a median of 2 (0-9) mutations. The most common mutations were TET2 (n=85), ASXL1 (n=73) and SRSF2 (n=59). Median time of follow up was 886 (4-1934) days. Sixty pts relapsed after a median of 189 (53-1281) days and 46 died due to non-relapse mortality after a median of 121 (4-1036) days. Remaining pts (n=160) were in continuous complete remission (CCR) after a median follow-up of 1053 (479-1934) days. Estimated 1 and 2y overall survival was 79\%, and 71\%, respectively, while estimated 1 and 2y relapse-free survival (RFS) was 75\% and 66\%, respectively. MRD data was missing in 46 pts; no post-HCT samples available (n=15), no mutation detected (n=14) and difficulties to design ddPCR primers (n=11). 221 pts were available for MRD analysis with a median number of 4 (0-13) and 5 (0-23) samples from BM and PB, respectively. Of 53 clinical relapses with MRD results available, 42 were preceded by pos MRD ({$>$}0.1\%) with a median of 70 (range 20-425) days between first pos MRD and clinical relapse. For the 11 remaining pts, 8 were inadequately sampled with a median time of 189 (82-397) days between last sampling and clinical relapse. One patient had an extramedullary relapse only. Of 31 pts who died without relapse, 19 were consistently MRD neg, while 5 were borderline positive (MRD {$>$} 0.1\% and {$<$}0.5\%) during the first 100 days but negative thereafter. Four MRD+ patients died without clinical relapse. Three pts were initially MRD+ but turned negative, all of which had chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Of 136 CCR patients, 94 were consistently MRD neg; 26 were borderline pos (MRD {$>$} 0.1\% and {$<$}0.5\%) during the first 100 days followed by neg samples; 16 were MRD positive (either {$>$} 0.5\% during the first 100d or {$>$} 0.1\% after 100d) of which 10 had a transition from pos to neg samples (all had cGVHD); one patient was treated for a molecular relapse detected by clinical routine method (FISH) and five patients were MRD positive at time of last follow-up. MRD used as a time-dependent co-variate was negatively associated with RFS (HR 7.1, p{$<$}0.01). Estimated cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality 2y after pos MRD was 60\% and 7\% respectively (see figure). Image:Summary/Conclusion: We report the development of a highly functional personalized MRD pipeline based on patient-specific mutations showing a high sensitivity to predict relapse and relapse-free survival.},

  abstract = {Maintenance therapy (MT) with oral methotrexate (MTX) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is essential for the cure of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MTX and 6-MP interfere with nucleotide synthesis and salvage pathways. The primary cytotoxic mechanism involves the incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) into DNA (as DNA-TG), which may be enhanced by the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis by other MTX/6-MP metabolites. Co-medication during MT is common. Although Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis appears safe, the benefit of glucocorticosteroid/vincristine pulses in improving survival and of allopurinol to moderate 6-MP pharmacokinetics remains uncertain. Numerous genetic polymorphisms influence the pharmacology, efficacy, and toxicity (mainly myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity) of MTX and thiopurines. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (encoded by TPMT) decreases TGNs but increases methylated 6-MP metabolites (MeMPs); similarly, nudix hydrolase 15 (encoded by NUDT15) also decreases TGNs available for DNA incorporation. Loss-of-function variants in both genes are currently used to guide MT, but do not fully explain the inter-patient variability in thiopurine toxicity. Because of the large inter-individual variations in MTX/6-MP bioavailability and metabolism, dose adjustments are traditionally guided by the degree of myelosuppression, but this does not accurately reflect treatment intensity. DNA-TG is a common downstream metabolite of MTX/6-MP combination chemotherapy, and a higher level of DNA-TG has been associated with a lower relapse hazard, leading to the development of the Thiopurine Enhanced ALL Maintenance (TEAM) strategy‚Äîthe addition of low-dose (2.5‚Äì12.5\,mg/m2/day) 6-thioguanine to the 6-MP/MTX backbone‚Äîthat is currently being tested in a randomized ALLTogether1 trial (EudraCT: 2018-001795-38). Mutations in the thiopurine and MTX metabolism pathways, and in the mismatch repair genes have been identified in early ALL relapses, providing valuable insights to assist the development of strategies to detect imminent relapse, to facilitate relapse salvage therapy, and even to bring about changes in frontline ALL therapy to mitigate this relapse risk.},

Carfilzomib (CFZ) can overcome rituximab chemotherapy resistance in lymphoma preclinical models by targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We conducted an investigator initiated, single-center, open-label, prospective phase 1 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CFZ in combination with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (C-R-ICE) in high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (HDC-ASCT) eligible patients with R/R~DLBCL (NCT01959698). In the dose-escalation phase, 18 patients were enrolled at 6 dose levels with no dose-limiting toxicities noted. CFZ 45 mg/m2 was selected as the recommended dose for expansion. Eleven additional patients were enrolled in the dose-expansion phase. Overall response rate (ORR) was 66\% (48\% CR; 17\% PR); 52\% patients underwent HDC-ASCT. An ORR of 85\% was observed in patients with nongerminal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) DLBCL compared with only 13\% in those with GCB DLBCL. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15.2 months (5.1 months, not reached [NR]), and median overall survival (OS) was 22.6 months (6.8 months, NR). Patients with non-GCB subtype had a significantly longer PFS (NR vs 6.6 months; P~= .0001) and OS (NR vs 6.6 months; P~= .001) than those with GCB subtype. C-R-ICE is well tolerated in patients with R/R DLBCL with toxicities comparable to rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide therapy. Our data show that patients with non-GCB DLBCL benefit significantly from incorporating CFZ into second-line therapy and HDC-ASCT.},

According to the current classification, 4 different subtypes can be identified, each with distinctive phenotypic and therapeutic characteristics. Current available laboratory methods allow a straightforward approach to VWD subtyping, and although the precise molecular characterization remains complex, it is not required for appropriate treatment of the vast majority of cases. Desmopressin can be useful only in a few type 2 cases compared with patients with actual quantitative deficiency (type 1), most often in variants with a nearly normal multimeric pattern (type 2M). However, since no laboratory test accurately predicts response to desmopressin, a trial test should always be performed in all type 2 VWD patients, with the exception of type 2B ones. Replacement therapy with plasma-derived von Willebrand factor-factor VIII concentrates represents the safe mainstay of treatment of all patients, particularly those not responding to desmopressin or requiring a sustained hemostatic correction because of major surgery or bleeding. A significant patient bleeding history correlates with increased bleeding risk and should be considered in tailoring the optimal antihemorrhagic prophylaxis in the individual patient.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in frontline therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), at least a third of those diagnosed still will require second or further lines for relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) disease. A small minority of these can be cured with standard chemoimmunotherapy/stem-cell transplant salvage approaches. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-19) therapies are increasingly altering the prognostic landscape for rel/ref patients with DLBCL and related aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Long-term follow up data show ongoing disease-free outcomes consistent with cure in 30‚Äì40\% after CAR-19, including high-risk patients primary refractory to or relapsing within 1 year of frontline treatment. This has made CAR-19 a preferred option for these difficult-to-treat populations. Widespread adoption, however, remains challenged by logistical and patient-related hurdles, including a requirement for certified tertiary care centers concentrated in urban centers, production times of at least 3‚Äì4 weeks, and high per-patients costs similar to allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are molecular biotherapies designed to bind and activate effector T-cells and drive them to B-cell antigens, leading to a similar cellular-dependent cytotoxicity as CAR-19. May and June of 2023 saw initial approvals of next-generation BsAbs glofitamab and epcoritamab in DLBCL as third or higher-line therapy, or for patients ineligible for CAR-19. BsAbs have similar spectrum but generally reduced severity of immune related side effects as CAR-19 and can be administered in community settings without need to manufacture patient-specific cellular products. To date and in contrast to CAR-19, however, there is no convincing evidence of cure after BsAbs monotherapy, though follow up is limited. The role of BsAbs in DLBCL treatment is rapidly evolving with trials investigating use in both relapsed and frontline curative-intent combinations. The future of DLBCL treatment is bound increasingly to include effector cell mediated immunotherapies, but further optimization of both cellular and BsAb approaches is needed.},

  abstract = {Treatment algorithms for poor cytogenetic-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), defined by chromosome 7 abnormalities or complex karyotype (CK), include allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). We studied outcome of alloSCT in chromosome 7 abnormal MDS patients as this data are scarce in literature. We specifically focused on the impact of the extra presence of CK and monosomal karyotype (MK). The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database contained data on 277 adult MDS patients with a chromosome 7 abnormality treated with alloSCT. Median age at alloSCT was 45 years. Median follow-up of patients alive was 5 years. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 22\% and 28\%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, statistically significant predictors for worse PFS were higher MDS stages treated, but not in complete remission (CR) (hazards ratio (HR) 1.7), and the presence of CK (HR 1.5) or MK (HR 1.8). Negative predictive factors for OS were higher MDS stages treated, but not in CR (HR 1.8), and the presence of CK (HR 1.6) or MK (HR 1.7). By means of the cross-validated log partial likelihood, MK showed to have a better predictive value than CK. The results are relevant when considering alloSCT for higher-stage MDS patients having MK including a chromosome 7 abnormality.}

The estimated 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 47.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 38.0-58.6) and 67.0\% (95\% CI, 57-79), respectively. Univariate analyses for PFS and OS identified Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) ‚â•2, stage III/IV disease, extranodal (EN) sites ‚â•2, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased C-reactive protein (CRP), high International Prognostic Index at TD and at TT, as well as increased CRP, bulky mass, and high TMTV at TT, as risk factors. Multivariate analyses for PFS, EP, and OS identified elevated LDH and EN sites ‚â•2 at TD and the same predictors at TT (ie, increased CRP, EN sites ‚â•2, and TMTV {$>$}80 mL). In summary, risk factors identified for early progression at TD and at TT were EN involvement (‚â•2 sites) and lymphoma burden (LDH, TMTV).},

The management of lower-risk (LR) MDS with persistent cytopenias remains suboptimal. Eltrombopag (EPAG), a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, can improve platelet counts in LR-MDS and tri-lineage hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia (AA). We conducted a phase 2 dose modification study to investigate the safety and efficacy of EPAG in LR-MDS. EPAG dose was escalated from 50 mg/day, to a maximum of 150 mg/day over a period of 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was hematologic response at 16-20 weeks. Eleven of 25 (44\%) patients responded; five and six patients had uni- or bi-lineage hematologic responses, respectively. The predictors of response were presence of a PNH clone, marrow hypocellularity, thrombocytopenia with or without other cytopenia, and elevated plasma thrombopoietin levels at study entry. The safety profile was consistent with previous EPAG studies in AA; no patients discontinued drug due to adverse events. Three patients developed reversible grade-3 liver toxicity and one patient had increased reticulin fibrosis. Ten patients discontinued EPAG after achieving a robust response (median time 16 months); four of them reinitiated EPAG due to declining counts, and all attained a second robust response. Six patients had disease progression not associated with expansion of mutated clones and no patient progressed to AML on study. In conclusion, EPAG was well-tolerated and effective in restoring hematopoiesis in patients with low to intermediate-1 risk MDS. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT00932156.}

Nonetheless, the exact mechanism by which haploinsufficiency results in erythroid failure, as well as the other clinical manifestations, remains uncertain. New knowledge regarding genetic and molecular mechanisms combined with robust clinical data from several international patient registries has provided important insights into the diagnosis of DBA and may, in the future, provide new treatments as well. Diagnostic criteria have been expanded to include patients with little or no clinical findings. Patient management is therefore centered on accurate diagnosis, appropriate use of transfusions and iron chelation, corticosteroids, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and a coordinated multidisciplinary approach to these complex patients.},

To increase durable antitumor response, we previously designed tandem CART19/20 cells and shown longer progression-free survival. However, a proportion of CART19/20-treated patients will finally progress and require salvage therapies. In this study, we analyzed data from five patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who had disease progression or relapse following CART19/20 therapy and then treated with PD-1-blocking antibodies as salvage therapy. Two of five patients acquired complete remissions after anti-PD-1 therapy, including one patient remained ongoing remission for more than 21~months. One patient achieved a partial remission, and the other two had progressive diseases. No\,‚â•\,grade 3 treatment-related adverse events or cytokine release syndrome was observed. Immunohistochemistry of tumor specimens revealed higher PD-1/PD-L1 expression in responsive patients with anti-PD-1 therapy as compared to that in~non-responders. After anti-PD-1 treatment, circulating T cells were activated in responders, and no significant expansion of CART19/20 cells was detected.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) is an autologous CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy approved for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This therapy was approved on the basis of the single-arm phase II ZUMA-2 trial, which showed best overall and complete response rates of 91\% and 68\%, respectively. We report clinical outcomes with brexu-cel in the standard-of-care setting for the approved indication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent leukapheresis between August 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, at 16 US institutions, with an intent to manufacture commercial brexu-cel for relapsed/refractory MCL, were included. Patient data were collected for analyses of responses, outcomes, and toxicities as per standard guidelines. RESULTS: Of 189 patients who underwent leukapheresis, 168 (89\%) received brexu-cel infusion. Of leukapheresed patients, 79\% would not have met ZUMA-2 eligibility criteria. Best overall and complete response rates were 90\% and 82\%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 14.3 months after infusion, the estimates for 6- and 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) were 69\% (95\% CI, 61 to 75) and 59\% (95\% CI, 51 to 66), respectively. The nonrelapse mortality was 9.1\% at 1 year, primarily because of infections. Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity occurred in 8\% and 32\%, respectively. In univariable analysis, high-risk simplified MCL international prognostic index, high Ki-67, TP53 aberration, complex karyotype, and blastoid/pleomorphic variant were associated with shorter PFS after brexu-cel infusion. Patients with recent bendamustine exposure (within 24 months before leukapheresis) had shorter PFS and overall survival after leukapheresis in intention-to-treat univariable analysis. CONCLUSION: In the standard-of-care setting, the efficacy and toxicity of brexu-cel were consistent with those reported in the ZUMA-2 trial. Tumor-intrinsic features of MCL, and possibly recent bendamustine exposure, may be associated with inferior efficacy outcomes.},

METHODS: Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MCL after ‚â•two lines of previous therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), an alkylating agent, and a CD20-targeted agent, received lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) at a target dose level (DL) of 50 √ó 106 (DL1) or 100 √ó 106 (DL2) chimeric antigen receptor-positive T cells. Primary end points were adverse events (AEs), dose-limiting toxicities, and objective response rate (ORR) by independent review committee per Lugano criteria. RESULTS: Of 104 leukapheresed patients, liso-cel was infused into 88. Median (range) number of previous lines of therapy was three (1-11) with 30\% receiving ‚â•five previous lines of therapy, 73\% of patients were age 65 years and older, 69\% had refractory disease, 53\% had BTKi refractory disease, 23\% had TP53 mutation, and 8\% had secondary CNS lymphoma. Median (range) on-study follow-up was 16.1 months (0.4-60.5). In the efficacy set (n = 83; DL1 + DL2), ORR was 83.1\% (95\% CI, 73.3 to 90.5) and complete response (CR) rate was 72.3\% (95\% CI, 61.4 to 81.6). Median duration of response was 15.7 months (95\% CI, 6.2 to 24.0) and progression-free survival was 15.3 months (95\% CI, 6.6 to 24.9). Most common grade ‚â•3 treatment-emergent AEs were neutropenia (56\%), anemia (37.5\%), and thrombocytopenia (25\%). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in 61\% of patients (grade 3/4, 1\%; grade 5, 0), neurologic events (NEs) in 31\% (grade 3/4, 9\%; grade 5, 0), grade ‚â•3 infections in 15\%, and prolonged cytopenia in 40\%. CONCLUSION: Liso-cel demonstrated high CR rate and deep, durable responses with low incidence of grade ‚â•3 CRS, NE, and infections in patients with heavily pretreated R/R MCL, including those with high-risk, aggressive disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract Relapse after stem cell transplantation for Philadelphia chromosomeÔøΩ¢ñØositive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a significant challenge. In this systematic review, we compare survival outcomes of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) nilotinib and dasatinib with first-generation TKI imatinib when these agents are used after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in Ph+ ALL. In addition, we review the literature on TKI use to prevent relapse in patients who proceed to allo-HSCT beyond first complete response ({$>$}CR1). We performed database searches (inception to January 2018) using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. After exclusions, 17 articles were included in this analysis. Imatinib was used post-transplant either prophylactically or preemptively in 12 studies, 7 prospective studies and 5 retrospective studies. Overall survival (OS) for most prospective studies at 1.5 to 3 and 5 years ranged between 62\% to 92\% and 74.5\% to 86.7\%. Disease-free survival at 1.5 to 5 years was 60.4\% to 92\%. Additionally, imatinib failed to show survival benefit in patients who were {$>$}CR1 at the time of allo-HSCT. The cumulative OS for most retrospective studies using imatinib at 1 to 2 and 3 to 5 years was 42\% to 100\% and 33\% to 40\% respectively. Event-free survival at 1 to 2 and 3 to 5 years was 33.3\% to 67\% and 20\% to 31\% respectively. Dasatinib was used as maintenance treatment in 3 retrospective studies (nÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ34). The OS for patients with Ph+ ALL using dasatinib as maintenance regimen after allo-HSCT at 1.4 to 3 years was 87\% to 100\% and disease-free survival at 1.4 to 3 years was 89\% to 100\%. Ninety-three percent of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) positive status after allo-HSCT became MRD negative. Three prospective studies used nilotinib. In 2 studies where investigators studied patients with advanced chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL, the cumulative OS and event-free survival at 7.5 months to 2 years were 69\% to 84\% and 56\% to 84\%, respectively. In the third study (nÔøΩÔøΩ=ÔøΩÔøΩ5) in patients with Ph+ ALL, nilotinib use resulted in OS at 5 years of 60\%. Our review showed that use of TKIs (all generations) after allo-HSCT for patients in CR1 improved OS when given as a prophylactic or preemptive regimen. Limited data suggest that second-generation TKIs (ie, dasatinib) have a better OS, especially in patients with MRD-positive status. Imatinib did not improve OS in patients who were {$>$}CR1 at the time of allo-HSCT; for this population, no data were available with newer generation TKIs. The evaluation of survival benefit with newer generation TKIs and their efficacy in patients in {$>$}CR1 needs further study in large randomized clinical trials.},

Between 1981 and 1996 we treated 99 patients with de novo MDS who had high-risk MDS or progression to AML, with IC. 41 (41\%) achieved CR, 16 (16\%) achieved partial remission (PR), 26 (26\%) had failure, and 16 (16\%) died in aplasia. Eight of the patients who achieved CR were autografted, three were allografted and the remaining cases received moderate consolidation chemotherapy. After IC, the 16 PR patients fulfilled the criteria for RA in 15 cases and CMML in one case. Median PR duration was 17 months, and three PR were {$>~$}3 years (39, 50+, 82+ months). Median actuarial survival of patients who achieved PR and CR was 18 months and 20 months from the onset of IC, respectively (difference not significant). Of the 71 patients treated before 1993, with sufficient follow-up, 10 (14\%) had survived {$>~$}4 years (long-term survivors). Four of them were alive in first CR after 49+ to 110+ months and probably cured, two were alive in PR after 50+ and 82+ months and four had died after 49‚Äì78 months. Long-term survivors were characterized by a significantly higher incidence of RAEB-T at diagnosis, and with normal or favourable cytogenetic findings. In patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis included before 1993, 8/23 (35\%) cases who had no unfavourable karyotype had survived {$>~$}4 years. Our findings suggest that MDS patients who achieve PR with IC, and not only those who achieve CR, can benefit from this type of treatment. The percentage of long-term survivors remains low, however, and is almost restricted to patients with RAEB-T at diagnosis and no unfavourable karyotype.}

  abstract = {Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is described as the outsized contribution of expanded clones of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to blood cell production. The prevalence of CH increases dramatically with age. CH can be caused by somatic mutations in individual genes or by gains and/or losses of larger chromosomal segments. CH is a premalignant state; the somatic mutations detected in CH are the initiating mutations for hematologic malignancies, and CH is a strong predictor of the development of blood cancers. Moreover, CH is associated with nonmalignant disorders and increased overall mortality. The somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion of HSPCs can alter the function of terminally differentiated blood cells, including the release of elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines may then contribute to a broad range of inflammatory disorders that increase in prevalence with age. Specific somatic mutations in the peripheral blood in coordination with blood count parameters can powerfully predict the development of hematologic malignancies and overall mortality in CH. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of CH nosology and origins. We provide an overview of available tools~for risk stratification and discuss management strategies for patients with CH presenting to hematology clinics.},

In a subsequent post hoc analysis with median follow-up of 17.5 months (range 0.1-23.5), median OS was significantly longer in patients receiving VEN~+ LDAC (8.4 vs 4.1 months; HR~= 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.99; P~= .04). Rates of CR/CRi were higher for patients receiving VEN~+ LDAC (48.3\%), compared with PBO~+ LDAC (13.2\%). In the present study, a final analysis with 2-years additional follow-up was undertaken to determine if the survival benefit of VEN~+LDAC was sustained. In addition, clinical and molecular correlates of survival among patients receiving VEN~+ LDAC were assessed. These analyses demonstrated that survival outcome was influenced by prior exposure to hypomethylating agents, clinical response, cytogenetic risk, and molecular genotype, with best outcomes observed for patients with NPM1 mutation. This longer-term final analysis confirmed the survival improvement of VEN~+ LDAC in patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy.},

Here, we report outcomes of a preplanned subgroup analysis of patients ‚â•65 years in ZUMA-7. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with LBCL refractory to or relapsed ‚â§12 months after first-line chemoimmunotherapy were randomized 1:1 to axicabtagene ciloleucel [axi-cel; autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy] or standard of care (SOC; 2-3 cycles of chemoimmunotherapy followed by HDT-ASCT). The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). Secondary endpoints included safety and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). RESULTS: Fifty-one and 58 patients aged ‚â•65 years were randomized to axi-cel and SOC, respectively. Median EFS was greater with axi-cel versus SOC (21.5 vs. 2.5 months; median follow-up: 24.3 months; HR, 0.276; descriptive P {$<$} 0.0001). Objective response rate was higher with axi-cel versus SOC (88\% vs. 52\%; OR, 8.81; descriptive P {$<$} 0.0001; complete response rate: 75\% vs. 33\%). Grade ‚â•3 adverse events occurred in 94\% of axi-cel and 82\% of SOC patients. No grade 5 cytokine release syndrome or neurologic events occurred. In the quality-of-life analysis, the mean change in PRO scores from baseline at days 100 and 150 favored axi-cel for EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health, Physical Functioning, and EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale (descriptive P {$<$} 0.05).

We hypothesized that imatinib plus sequential chemotherapy will result in significant leukemia cell cytoreduction in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, allowing collection of normal hematopoietic stem cells uncontaminated by residual BCR/ABL1+ lymphoblasts and thus reduce the likelihood of relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation for patients under 60 years of age without sibling donors. We enrolled 58 patients; 19 underwent autologous and 15 underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation on study. Imatinib plus sequential chemotherapy resulted in reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-negative stem cells in 9 patients and remained minimally positive in 4 (6 were not evaluable). Overall survival (median 6.0 years vs. not reached) and disease-free survival (median 3.5 vs. 4.1 years) were similar between those who underwent autologous and those who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We conclude that autologous stem cell transplantation represents a safe and effective alternative for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients without sibling donors (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:00039377).},

Adults (N=65) with Ph-positive ALL received dasatinib and dexamethasone induction, methotrexate-based central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy alone based on age and donor availability, and dasatinib-based maintenance. Key efficacy endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The median age was 60 years (range, 22-87). The complete remission rate was 98.5\%. With a median follow up of 59 months, 5-year DFS and OS were 37\% (median, 30 months) and 48\% (median, 56 months), respectively. For patients receiving RIC allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy, 5-year DFSs were 49\%, 29\%, and 34\% and 5-year OSs were 62\%, 57\%, and 46\%, respectively.

Relapse occurred in 25\% of allogeneic HCT, 57\% of autologous HCT, and 36\% of chemotherapy patients. T315I mutation was detected in 6 of 8 marrow relapses. Dasatinib CNS concentrations were low. Dasatinib and dexamethasone followed by RIC allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or chemotherapy was feasible and efficacious, especially with RIC allogeneic HCT.

The successful implementation of involved node radiation therapy requires optimal imaging and precise coregistration of baseline imaging with the radiation therapy planning computed tomography scan. Limitations of baseline imaging, changes in patient position, and anatomic changes after chemotherapy may make this difficult in routine practice. Involved site radiation therapy (ISRT) was introduced by the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group as a slightly larger treated volume, intended to allow for commonly encountered uncertainties. In addition to imaging considerations, the optimal ISRT treatment volume also depends on disease histology, stage, nodal or extranodal location, and the type and efficacy of systemic therapy, which in turn influence the distribution of macroscopic and potential subclinical disease. This article presents a systematic overview of ISRT, updating key evidence and highlighting differences in the application of ISRT across the lymphoma clinical spectrum.},

  abstract = {The genetic architecture of cancer has been delineated through advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing, where the sequential acquisition of recurrent driver mutations initially targeted towards normal cells ultimately leads to malignant transformation. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are hematologic malignancies frequently initiated by mutations in the normal hematopoietic stem cell compartment leading to the establishment of leukemic stem cells. Although the genetic characterization of MDS and AML has led to identification of new therapeutic targets and development of new promising therapeutic strategies, disease progression, relapse, and treatment-related mortality remain a major challenge in MDS and AML. The selective persistence of rare leukemic stem cells following therapy-induced remission implies unique resistance mechanisms of leukemic stem cells towards conventional therapeutic strategies and that leukemic stem cells represent the cellular origin of relapse. Therefore, targeted surveillance of leukemic stem cells following therapy should, in the future, allow better prediction of relapse and disease progression, but is currently challenged by our restricted ability to distinguish leukemic stem cells from other leukemic cells and residual normal cells. To advance current and new clinical strategies for the treatment of MDS and AML, there is a need to improve our understanding and characterization of MDS and AML stem cells at the cellular, molecular, and genetic levels. Such work has already led to the identification of promising new candidate leukemic stem cell molecular targets that can now be exploited in preclinical and clinical therapeutic strategies, towards more efficient and specific elimination of leukemic stem cells.}

  abstract = {IntroductionStudies showed that remission after induction therapy is associated with better prognosis in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients, and minimal residual disease (MRD) is also considered as an independent and sensitive factor in MCL patients. As R-CHOP/R-DHAOx is the most common used induction regimen in China, we investigate the benefit of zanubrutinib-based induction (zanubrutinib plus R-CHOP) in untreated young MCL patients. We previously reported a promising result of an ORR of 100\% with MRD negative rate of 100\% after induction treatment in 2022 PPLC. Here, we reported a long-time (median follow-up: 25.9 months) efficacy and safety in the study.MethodsIn this prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase II study (NCT04736914), patients aged 18-65 years with previously untreated, Ann Arbor stage II-IV, histologically confirmed MCL will be enrolled to alternately receive R-CHOP + zanubrutinib and R-DHAOx induction for 6 cycles (every 21 days per cycle). Zanubrutinib will be administered in cycle 1, 3, 5 (R-CHOP), 160 mg BID, d1-21, and not in combination with R-DHAOx. Patients who achieve remission (‚â•PR) will be allowed to proceed to ASCT or maintenance depending on the investigator's evaluation and discretion. In patients who do not achieve a remission at the end of induction (treatment failure), no specific treatment is defined; rather, the further salvage treatment is upon the discretion of investigators. Patients will receive zanubrutinib maintenance for two years in case of remission at ASCT assessment or end of induction assessment. Zanubrutinib is administrated orally at 160 mg BID, continuously for 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death, whichever occurs first. The primary endpoint was bone marrow MRD negative rate after induction therapy (at the completion of cycle 6 or at premature discontinuation).ResultsA total of 7 patients were enrolled, the median age was 56.3, and bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB) MRD showed positive at baseline. After 6 cycles of R-CHOP + zanubrutinib and R-DHAOx induction treatment, BM and PB MRD negative rate was 100\% (7/7). One patient proceeded to ASCT. At the data cut-off date of 30 Jun 2023, one patient has completed the study at week 53 with zanubrutinib maintenance treatment due to the progressive disease, while the other 6 patients remain in the zanubrutinib maintenance treatment and are still under follow-up (Figure). With a median follow-up of 25.9 months, all patients showed good tolerance, with no dose modification and discontinuation during zanubrutinib-based induction therapy, either no BTKi interested AE (includes diarrhea, hypertension, major hemorrhage, and atrial fibrillation/flutter) was observed (Table).ConclusionsThis prospective, phase II study with a relatively longer follow-up duration estimated the treatment regimen in untreated young MCL patients. At the time of data cut-off, zanubrutinib-based induction therapy was well tolerated in all patients and showed a promising results in response and MRD. With a median treatment duration of 16.6 months, most patients (6/7) did not relapse. The study is ongoing and further results will be continuously released.},

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors have established therapeutic activity in B-cell malignancies, with modest activity in DLBCL. Zanubrutinib, a potent and selective BTK inhibitor, was evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) non-GCB DLBCL. The BGB-3111-207 study (NCT03145064) was a multicenter single-arm phase 2 study. Patients received twice-daily oral zanubrutinib, 160 mg, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR). Overall survival (OS) was an exploratory end point. Forty-one patients were enrolled in China after having progressed or not responded to prior therapy. At data cutoff, 4~patients continued treatment with 37 discontinuations. The median follow-up was 6.8 months, the ORR was 29.3\%, and the complete response rate was 17.1\%. Median DOR, PFS, and OS were 4.5, 2.8, and 8.4 months, respectively. Adverse events (AEs) leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 4 patients, and grade ‚â• 3 AEs were reported in 48.8\% of patients. Major hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, and/or flutter were not observed. Zanubrutinib demonstrated modest antitumor activity in non-GCB DLBCL, like other BTK inhibitors, as well as a safety profile consistent with previous studies. Through retrospective biomarker testing, potential antitumor activity was observed in patients with both CD79B and MYD88 mutations, who have inferior outcomes to immunochemotherapy. Future studies of zanubrutinib in R/R non-GCB DLBCL will focus on developing mechanism-based treatment combinations and biomarker-driven patient selection.},

  abstract = {Genetic alterations, including mutations and copy-number alterations, are central to the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes and related diseases (myelodysplasia), but their roles in allogeneic stem cell transplantation have not fully been studied in a large cohort of patients. We enrolled 797 patients who had been diagnosed with myelodysplasia at initial presentation and received transplantation via the Japan Marrow Donor Program. Targeted-capture sequencing was performed to identify mutations in 69 genes, together with copy-number alterations, whose effects on transplantation outcomes were investigated. We identified 1776 mutations and 927 abnormal copy segments among 617 patients (77.4\%). In multivariate modeling using Cox proportional-hazards regression, genetic factors explained 30\% of the total hazards for overall survival; clinical characteristics accounted for 70\% of risk. TP53 and RAS-pathway mutations, together with complex karyotype (CK) as detected by conventional cytogenetics and/or sequencing-based analysis, negatively affected posttransplant survival independently of clinical factors. Regardless of disease subtype, TP53-mutated patients with CK were characterized by unique genetic features and associated with an extremely poor survival with frequent early relapse, whereas outcomes were substantially better in TP53-mutated patients without CK. By contrast, the effects of RAS-pathway mutations depended on disease subtype and were confined to myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs). Our results suggest that TP53 and RAS-pathway mutations predicted a dismal prognosis, when associated with CK and MDS/MPNs, respectively. However, for patients with mutated TP53 or CK alone, long-term survival could be obtained with transplantation. Clinical sequencing provides vital information for accurate prognostication in transplantation.}

  abstract = {Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 30\% of adult acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) are characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+), having a (9;22) chromosomal translocation. The BCR/ABL fusion protein is the hallmark of Ph+ leukemia. BCR/ABL is characterized by deregulated and constitutively activated ABL tyrosine kinase activity that determines its transformation potential. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have greatly improved the overall prognosis of these diseases, particularly by altering the natural history of chronic phase (CP) CML and preventing the previously inexorable progression to terminal blast crisis (BC). However, unsatisfactory responses in advanced disease stages, resistance and long-term tolerability of BCR/ABL inhibitors represent major clinical problems. The most important mechanism of resistance against TKIs is the selection of leukemic clones driven by BCR/ABL harboring point mutations, such as the E255K, Y253F/H (P-loop), H396R (activation loop) or the T315I (gatekeeper). The "gatekeeper" mutation T315I confers resistance against all approved TKIs, with the only exception of Ponatinib, a multi-target kinase inhibitor. CML and Ph+ ALL, rarely present at diagnosis with a BCR/ABL harboring a resistance mutation to TKI. Resistant clones may be present and only detectable by highly sensitive methods. We have previously shown that the resistance mutations may influence the biology of BCR/ABL and its transformation potential.We therefore hypothesized that the presence of mutations such as the T315I select for a "dormant cell population" which manifests following initial treatments with TKI inhibitors and treatment failure. The aim of this study was to determine whether the ''gatekeeper'' mutation T315I is able to confer biological features to BCR/ABL influencing its leukemogenic potential.We investigated the influence of T315I on the biology of BCR/ABL in CML and Ph+ ALL. We used Ph+ ALL patient derived long term culture (PDLTCs), factor dependent Ba/F3 cells and syngeneic mouse model of BCR/ABL induced CML-like disease. These models allowed the direct comparison of BCR/ABL with BCR/ABL-T315I. We observed significantly slower proliferation of Ba/F3 cells and PDLTCs expressing BCR/ABL-T315I compared to the native BCR/ABL. This was further confirmed by undertaking mitotic index calculations and colony formation assays on both cell types. Furthermore, the induction of a CML-like disease in syngeneic mice was significantly delayed in the presence of T315I (median: BCR/ABL - 27 days; BCR/ABL-T315I - 61 days). We undertook functional studies to determine the putative signaling pathway and found that Ras/Erk1/2 pathway was activated inT315I positive cells.This study may assist towards therapy decisions in patients with CML/Ph+ ALL with a T315I mutation.No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs), azacitidine and decitabine, are standard of care therapy for higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. However, outcomes reported for real-world studies fall short of those achieved in clinical trials. We conducted a targeted literature review exploring real-world utilization, persistence and outcomes with intravenous and subcutaneous HMA therapies to better understand barriers to achieving optimal outcomes in clinical practice. The potential benefits of oral HMA therapy were also explored. Underutilization and poor persistence with HMA therapy are associated with suboptimal outcomes, highlighting the need for approaches to improve utilization and persistence, so that patients achieve the optimum benefit from HMA therapy.}

  abstract = {Background:The Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) and the Nordic Lymphoma Group (NLG) conducted the SAKK 35/10 randomized phase-2 trial (NCT0137605) to compare the effectiveness of rituximab (R) alone versus R combined with lenalidomide (L) as the initial treatment for symptomatic follicular lymphoma (FL). The primary endpoint analysis, which demonstrated higher complete remission (CR) rates with the combination therapy, was previously reported (Zucca et al. Blood 2019). This report provides a long-term analysis of time-to-event endpoints with a median follow-up of approximately 10 years. Methods:A total of 154 eligible patients with untreated grade 1 to 3a FL requiring systemic therapy were centrally randomized to receive either R monotherapy (375 mg/m2 IV on day 1 of weeks 1-4 and repeated during weeks 12-15 for responding patients) or R+L. In the combination arm, R was administered at the same schedule as the monotherapy, while L was taken orally at a daily dose of 15 mg, starting 14 days before the first R administration, and continued until 14 days after the last R administration, for a total of 18 weeks. Random assignment to treatment arms was stratified based on histological grade (1-2 vs 3a), bulky disease ({$<$}6 vs ‚â•6 cm), Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score (1-2 vs ‚â•3), and centre, using the minimization method. The sample size was determined to detect a 20\% increase in the CR/CRu rate with 90\% power, using a one-sided Z-test with a false positive rate of 10\% to compare the two treatment arms. The assessed endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT), duration of CR/CRu (DoR), and overall survival (OS), were defined according to NCI international standardized criteria (Cheson et al. J Clin Oncol 1999). Results:Seventy-seven patients (median age 63 years, 52\% with stage IV and 47\% with poor-risk FLIPI score) were assigned to the single-agent rituximab arm, and 77 patients (median age 61 years, 48\% with stage IV and 47\% with poor-risk FLIPI score) were assigned to the combination arm. The results for the primary endpoint were consistent with the positive initial analysis. At a median follow-up of 9.5 years, the overall survival was similar in both arms (77\% vs. 78\% at 10 years, p=0.881). However, significant, and sustained improvements were seen in all other time-to-event endpoints. Patients in the R+L arm had a longer PFS (median, 9.3 vs. 2.3 years; HR=0.58, 95\% CI: 0.37-0.89; p=0.013) and TTNT (median, not reached vs. 2.1 years; HR=0.43, 95\% CI: 0.27-0.67; p{$<$}0.001). DoR with R+L was also longer (median not reached vs 3.2 years with R only; HR=0.42, 95\% CI: 0.21-0.86; p=0.014) and with over 60\% of responders still in first remission at 10 years. The improved outcomes with R+L were not associated with unexpected toxicity. Grade ‚â•3 adverse events were more common with the combination regimen (56\% vs. 22\% of patients), with grade 3-4 neutropenia in 23\% of patients receiving R+L and in 7\% of those receiving R alone. Fatigue, diarrhea, and skin rash were more frequent with R+L, but mostly of grade 1-2 (grade 3 occurred in ‚â§ 5\% in both arms, and no grade 4 was reported). The side effects were manageable, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm. Two cases of biopsy-proven into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were reported in the R+L arm, and two cases of Hodgkin lymphoma were described in the R arm. Although their causal relationship with treatment is not completely clear, the number of second solid cancers was significantly higher in the R+L arm. Two cases of prostate cancer, two lung adenocarcinomas (one in situ), one small cell lung carcinoma, one rectal cancer, and four skin cancers (three squamous cell and one basal cell), were observed in the R+L arm, while only one solid tumor (prostate cancer) occurred in the R arm (p=0.09). Only one patient died of a second solid cancer (small cell lung carcinoma in the R+L arm). The rate of POD24 was 29\% in the R+L arm vs. 34\% in the R-arm (p=0.483). Conclusions:The long-term results of the SAKK 35/10 trial demonstrated a durable benefit for the R+L combination compared to R alone. Notably, the adopted R+L schedule is considerably shorter than the standard R2 regimen (18 vs. 120 weeks). This provides a promising alternative when treatment is required but durable immunosuppression is undesirable.},
