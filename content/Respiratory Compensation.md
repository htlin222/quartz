# Respiratory Compensation

Uncomplicated metabolic alkalosis rapidly (minutes to hours) generates hypoventilatory compensation that elevates the pCO2. Compensation reduces the arterial pH, but it generally remains >7.45. Although the magnitude of the hypoventilatory response is proportional to the [HCO3âˆ’] increase, the response is very variable (Figure 1) (3â€“6, M.A. Fallahzadeh, *et al.*, unpublished observations).
