# Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT)

- Historically: IVF & pressors for MAP ≥65 mmHg, CVP 8–12 mmHg, UOP ≥0.5 mL/kg/h; inotropes & PRBCs for ScvO2 ≥70% in 6 h (NEJM 2001;345:1368)

- However, now in era of early abx and adequate fluid resuscitation, no ↓ in mortality w/ EGDT vs. current usual care, and ↑ hospital costs (NEJM 2017; 376:2223)
