## Differential diagnosis:
-   Infection
-   Malignancy: If very high WBC, consider acute leukemia
-   Inflammatory/autoimmune conditions
-   De-margination: Stress response, steroids

* [[approach to the patient with neutrophilia]]

(>7500–10,000/µL)

## Infection

Usually bacterial; ± [[toxic granulations]], [[Döhle bodies]]

## Inflammation

Burn, tissue necrosis, MI, PE, collagen vascular disease

## Drugs and toxins

Corticosteroids, β-agonists, lithium, G-CSF; cigarette smoking

## Stress

Release of endogenous glucocorticoids and catecholamines

## Marrow stimulation

Hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia

## Asplenia

Surgical, acquired (sickle cell), congenital (dextrocardia)

## Neoplasm

Can be 1° (MPN) or paraneoplastic (eg, carcinomas of lung, GI)

## Leukemoid reaction
