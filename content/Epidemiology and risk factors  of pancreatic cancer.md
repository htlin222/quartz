# Epidemiology and risk factors of pancreatic cancer

(Lancet 2016;388:73)

- Incidence: Estimated âˆ¼60,430 new cases/y & âˆ¼48,220 deaths/y in the United States (NCI SEER); increasing incidence, particularly early onset (<50 yo) (_Lancet_ 2019;4(3):E137); 4th most common cause of CA deaths in U.S. men & women; estimated to be 2nd leading cause of CA-related mortality by 2030 (_Cancer Res_ 2014;74:2913)
- Acquired RFs: Age (median: 70 yo), race, tobacco, EtOH, â†‘ BMI, chronic pancreatitis, occupational exposure, DM
  - Acquired risk factors: smoking (RR ~1.5; 25% cases), obesity, chronic pancreatitis, T2DM
- Hereditary (5â€“10%) RFs: â†‘ Risk w/ FHx, âˆ¼5â€“15% pts have genetic predisposition - Inherited susceptibility to pancreatic CA (_NEJM_ 2008;359:2143)
  - Familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma syn, _CDKN2A_ (p16) (15% lifetime risk)
  - Hereditary breast CA syn, _BRCA2_ (5% lifetime risk) > _BRCA1_ > _PALB2_
  - Lynch syn, _MSH2,_ & _MLH1_
  - Peutzâ€“Jeghers syn, _STK11_ (30% lifetime risk)
  - Ataxiaâ€“telangiectasia, _ATM_
  - Hereditary chronic pancreatitis syn, germline muts in cationic trypsinogen (_PRSS1_) or secretory trypsin inhibitor (_SPINK1_) (40% lifetime risk)
  - NOTE FDRs of individuals w/ familial pancreatic CA â†’ EUS + MRI (_Gut_ 2013;62:339)
