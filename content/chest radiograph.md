## Consolidation: 水、血、膿
### SILHOUETTE SIGN
* heart, aorta, or diaphragm
* bronchopneumonia: Multifocal consolidation
* DIFFUSE CONSOLIDATION: crazy paving
	* pulmonary edema
	* ARDS
	* pulmonary hemorrhage
	* Pneumocystis
* Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
	* predominant peribronchial and peripheral distribution
### FOCAL AND MULTIFOCAL CONSOLIDATION
### EXTENSIVE CONFLUENT AND DIFFUSE CONSOLIDATION
### ACUTE CAUSES OF PARENCHYMAL CONSOLIDATION
### CHRONIC CAUSES OF PARENCHYMAL CONSOLIDATION

## Atelectasis

#### Obstructive atelectasis
Distal to obstruction of a bronchus
#### Passive atelectasis
Retraction of lung in the presence of pneumothorax
#### Compressive atelectasis
Compression by a space-occupying process, such as a pleural effusion, pulmonary mass, or bulla
#### Adhesive atelectasis
Caused by deficiency of surfactant (e.g., radiation pneumonitis)
#### Cicatrization atelectasis
Caused by contraction of fibrous tissue as it matures; can be focal (e.g., tuberculosis) or diffuse (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)

### Patterns of Atelectasis
S sign of Golden
juxtaphrenic peak
Luftsichel sign
thymic sail sign
