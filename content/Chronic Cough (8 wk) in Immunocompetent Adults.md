# Chronic Cough (8 wk) in Immunocompetent Adults #ðŸš§ æ–½å·¥ä¸­

### Chronic Cough (>8 wk) in Immunocompetent Adults

â€¢Â Â Â Evaluate for red flags: Evaluate for red flags and consider CXR. If red flags present or concerning findings on CXR, proceed with a more urgent workup

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology and diagnosis: Consider common causes of subacute to chronic cough: See Table 2.4


**TABLE 2.4 â€¢ Differential Diagnosis for Causes of Subacute to Chronic Cough**




â€¢Â Â Â Refractory chronic cough:

-Â Â Â If symptoms continue despite evaluation/empiric treatment for common causes, consider less common causes of chronic cough. Differential diagnosis:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Infectious: *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, Nontuberculous mycobacterium (including *Mycobacterium avium complex* (MAC), *Mycobacterium kansasii*, and *Mycobacterium abscessus*), endemic fungal infections

**â€¢**Â Â Â Cardiac: LV failure, dilated left atrium, mitral stenosis

**â€¢**Â Â Â Other: Post-infectious cough, chronic aspiration, sarcoidosis, laryngeal spasm, non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), psychogenic cough

-Â Â Â Workup may include: Labs (including CBC with differential to evaluate for eosinophilia), repeat CXR, advanced imaging, sputum cultures, PFTs, sleep apnea testing, TTE, referral to pulmonary/ENT/ID, bronchoscopy
