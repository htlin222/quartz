### Myopathies

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Myopathy refers to any disease that affects the muscle tissue, which can occur due to inherited or acquired causes

â€¢Â Â Â Physical exam:

-Â Â Â LMN signs, often symmetric. Typically proximal weakness with relatively preserved reflexes

-Â Â Â Typically no fasiculations because no denervation

-Â Â Â May have atrophy, but typically less prominent than atrophy associated with motor neuropathy

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis:

-Â Â Â Primarily a clinical diagnosis

-Â Â Â Serum creatine kinase (CK) is typically elevated

-Â Â Â Additional work-up may include: EMG (may or may not be abnormal), muscle biopsy, and/or genetic testing

â€¢Â Â Â Etiologies:

-Â Â Â Toxin induced: Chronic alcohol use

-Â Â Â Endocrinopathies: Hyper- or hypothyroidism, Cushingâ€™s disease

-Â Â Â Autoimmune/inflammatory: Dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). See Table 12.5.


**TABLE 12.5** â€¢ Dermatomyositis, Polymyositis, and Inclusion Body Myositis




-Â Â Â Genetic: Muscular dystrophies, mitochondrial myopathies, congenital myopathies

-Â Â Â Infections: Myositis (especially with viral infections)

-Â Â Â Medications: Statins

-Â Â Â Rhabdomyolysis

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Correct the underlying disorder if present. See Table 12.5 for treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.
