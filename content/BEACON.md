# BEACON

[Encorafenib, Binimetinib, and Cetuximab in BRAF V600E-Mutated Colorectal Cancer | NEJM](https://www-nejm-org.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1908075)

## Encorafenib, Binimetinib, and Cetuximab in Patients with BRAF V600E-Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Updated Overall Survival Results from a Randomized, Open-Label, Phase 3 Trial (BEACON CRC)

1. **Design**
   - Open-label, Phase 3 trial
   - Multi-center
   - Randomized
   - Three treatment groups:
      - Triplet-therapy group: encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab
      - Doublet-therapy group: encorafenib and cetuximab
      - Control group: investigator's choice of cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI
2. **Number of patients:** 665
3. **Patients characteristics:**
   - Metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation
   - Disease progression after one or two previous regimens
4. **Agent:**
   - Encorafenib
   - Binimetinib
   - Cetuximab
5. **Treatment line:** Second or third-line therapy
6. **Trial Name/NCT Number:** BEACON CRC ClinicalTrials.gov number - NCT02928224
7. **Comparison of two groups:**

| Endpoint | Triplet-therapy group | Control group |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overall survival | Median of 9.0 months (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.70; P<0.001) | Median of 5.4 months |
| Confirmed response rate | 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) | 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) |
| Overall survival in doublet-therapy group vs. control group | Median of 8.4 months (hazard ratio for death vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001) | Not reported |

8. **Other findings:**
   - Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 58% of patients in the triplet-therapy group, in 50% in the doublet-therapy group, and in 61% in the control group.
9. **Summary:**
   The BEACON CRC trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation. The triplet-therapy group showed a significantly longer median overall survival and a higher confirmed response rate compared to the control group. The doublet-therapy group also showed a longer median overall survival compared to the control group. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were more common in the control group. These findings suggest that encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab could be a valuable treatment option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF V600E mutation.
