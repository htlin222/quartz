# r-mpv_wbrt_hd-ac

[Combined immunochemotherapy with reduced whole-brain radiotherapy for newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17947720/)

- The R-MPV protocol used in the study consisted of the following components:

  - Rituximab 500 mg/m^2 on day 1.
  - Methotrexate (MTX) 3.5 g/m^2 and vincristine 1.4 mg/m^2 on day 2.
  - Procarbazine 100 mg/m^2/day for 7 days with odd-numbered cycles.

- This regimen was administered for five to seven cycles as induction chemotherapy for primary CNS lymphoma patients in the study .

**Key Takeaways from the Research Paper:**

- The study focused on evaluating the safety and efficacy of combining rituximab with methotrexate-based chemotherapy for primary CNS lymphoma, along with the use of reduced-dose whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after achieving complete response (CR) .

- Patients treated with the R-MPV protocol showed promising results, with a 2-year overall survival rate of 67% and a progression-free survival rate of 57% after a median follow-up of 37 months. Notably, a high overall response rate of 93% was achieved, with a significant percentage of patients attaining CR after the induction chemotherapy cycles .

- The study also included post-WBRT treatment with two cycles of high-dose cytarabine, monitoring of rituximab levels in cerebrospinal fluid for selected patients, and prospective neurocognitive evaluations to assess treatment outcomes .
