# Pathophysiology-Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenias

 Ab binds heparin-PF4 → immune complex binds to plt → plt activation, further PF4 release → plt aggregates removed from circulation → thrombocytopenia; procoagulants released by plts and tissue factor released by endothelial cells damaged by HIT Abs → prothrombotic state
