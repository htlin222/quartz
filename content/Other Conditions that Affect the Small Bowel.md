### Other Conditions that Affect the Small Bowel

##### Microscopic colitis

â€¢Â Â Â Epidemiology: Age of diagnosis typically 45â€“65 yr; more common in females than males

â€¢Â Â Â Etiology: Chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with two histologic subtypes: 1) Lymphocytic and 2) Collagenous colitis. Associated with autoimmune diseases, NSAIDs, tobacco use.

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Chronic, watery, non-bloody diarrhea.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Colonoscopy with biopsy showing lymphocytic or collagenous colitis. Workup should include ruling out infectious causes (check stool studies) and celiac sprue (check serologies).

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: 1) Stop NSAIDs (or other offending medications); 2) Loperamide for symptoms; 3) Budesonide for active disease. Second-line agents include cholestyramine, bismuth, and biologics if needed.

##### Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Idiopathic and multifactorial, sometimes considered a functional disorder. Associated with female sex, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia.

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Subtypes are IBS-C (constipation), IBS-D (diarrhea), IBD with mixed bowel movements.

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis:

-Â Â Â Exclude other organic etiologies through history and labs: Fecal calprotectin, stool studies, celiac disease studies.

-Â Â Â Colonoscopy is typically not needed, but should be considered for alarm features: Age >50 yr, GI bleeding, weight loss, progressive abdominal pain, lab abnormalities, family history of IBD, colon cancer.

-Â Â Â Rome IV criteria: Abdominal pain at least once per week for â‰¥3 months with â‰¥2 symptoms related to defecation, change in stool frequency, change in stool form.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment:

-Â Â Â For all subtypes: Education/reassurance, low FODMAP diet, dicyclomine for abdominal cramping, encapsulated peppermint oil

-Â Â Â IBS-D: Loperamide, cholestyramine, 5HT-3 antagonists, rifaximin, TCAs, SNRI

-Â Â Â IBS-C: Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX), psyllium, prucalopride, plecanatide, lubiprostone, linaclotide, SSRI (not paroxetine), SNRI

-Â Â Â IBS-M: Fiber supplementation

##### Mesenteric ischemia

â€¢Â Â Â Definition: Ischemia affecting the small intestine is generally referred to as mesenteric ischemia, while ischemia affecting the large intestine is referred to as colonic ischemia; mesenteric ischemia can be subdivided into acute and chronic subtypes.

Acute mesenteric ischemia

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Can be caused by arterial embolism (50%; e.g., Afib), arterial thrombosis (15â€“25%; e.g., atherosclerosis), venous thrombosis (5%; e.g., in setting of infection, hypercoagulability, malignancy), nonocclusive (20â€“30%; e.g., hypoperfusion, such as in hypotensive patient)

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings; anorexia, vomiting, mild GI bleed

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: CT angiogram

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: IV fluids, anticoagulation, broad-spectrum antibiotics. Arterial: Early surgical laparotomy with embolectomy. Venous: Anticoagulation. Nonocclusive: Treat underlying cause.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Atherosclerosis can cause abdominal angina

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Dull pain that typically starts about one hour after eating; can cause food anxiety with subsequent weight loss

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: CT angiogram

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Antiplatelet therapy, surgical revascularization

##### Carcinoid syndrome

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Neuroendocrine tumor that secretes serotonin

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: 1) Flushing, 2) Diarrhea, 3) Wheezing, 4) Right-sided valvular heart disease (pathognomonic plaque-like deposits of fibrous tissue)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Increased urine 5-HIAA; imaging for tumor localization (e.g., CT, somatostatin receptor imaging) with EGD/colonoscopy if primary site remains undetermined

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Surgical removal of the tumor. If not resectable, octreotide injection (long-acting release), telotristat, loperamide
