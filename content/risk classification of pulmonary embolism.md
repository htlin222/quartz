# risk classification of pulmonary embolism

## High risk (“massive”):
	* hemodyn unstable w/ arrest,
	* obstructive shock
	* persistent HoTN

## Intermediate risk (“submassive”):
	* sPESI ≥1
		* “Intermediate-high” if both RV dysfunction & elevated Tn
		* “Intermediate-low” if either or neither RV dysfunction or elevated Tn

## Low risk:
	* clinically stable,
	* sPESI = 0,
	* normal RV function,
	* normal Tn
