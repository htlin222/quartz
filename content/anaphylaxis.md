- The **term** **aspiration** **pneumonia** should be reserved specifically for **pneumonitis** resulting from **aspiration** of **oropharyngeal** or gastric **contents** ( table 1 ) .
- This is typically due to **impairment** of the **clearance** **defenses** ( **eg** , depressed **sensorium** , glottic **closure** , or cough reflex ) .
- The **character** of the **inoculum** , underlying pulmonary **conditions** , and **presentation** **assist** in distinguishing the three most common clinical **syndromes** within the **category** of **aspiration** **pneumonia** , namely chemical **pneumonitis** , bacterial **infection** , and airway **obstruction** .
- Although there may occasionally be overlap and it is often difficult to classify individual **cases** with **certainty** , this **classification** **scheme** is essential to an **understanding** of **aspiration** **pneumonia** .
