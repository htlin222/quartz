### Prevalence vs. Incidence

â€¢Â Â Â Prevalence: Total cases in a population at a given time/total population (â†“Prevalance can be due to more prevention or more treatment; â†‘Prevalance if those living with the disease have a longer lifespan)

â€¢Â Â Â Incidence: New cases/total in population at risk. Only prevention (not treatment) decreases incidence, since the total population *at-risk* excludes anyone who is already sick
