# Diagnosis-skin and soft tissue infections

## [[Differential Diagnosis of Cellulitis]]

* Clinical diagnosis based on physical examination
* Cultures from intact skin are not helpful and should not be performed (CID 2014;59:e10)
* BCx are typically low yield (~5â€“10%)
* Ultrasound can be used to identify deep abscesses and facilitate drainage. If abscess is found, incision/drainage is key to treatment.
* Aspirate from an abscess may provide microbiologic dx
