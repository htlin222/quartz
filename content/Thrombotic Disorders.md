### Thrombotic Disorders

**Inherited hypercoagulable states**

â€¢Â Â Â Factor V Leiden: Autosomal dominant disorder, but heterozygotes have an increased risk of thrombosis (avoid OCPs). Mutated form of Factor V lacks cleavage site for deactivation by Protein C.

â€¢Â Â Â Prothrombin G20201A: Point mutation in the 3â€™ untranslated region of prothrombin so â†‘prothrombin â†’ â†‘thrombin â†’ â†‘thrombus risk

â€¢Â Â Â Protein C/S deficiency: Autosomal dominant disorder. Normally, protein C and S inactivate factor V, VIII. Can cause increased risk of warfarin skin necrosis.

â€¢Â Â Â Anti-thrombin (AT) deficiency: Autosomal dominant disorder. AT normally inactivates thrombin and factors II, VII, IXâ€“XII.

â€¢Â Â Â Antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS): Associated with SLE. Autoantibody against protein bound to phospholipids.

-Â Â Â Clinical features: Venous and arterial clots, placental thrombosis (pregnancy loss), stroke, â†‘PTT (antibodies interfere with the assay)

-Â Â Â Diagnosis: Sapporo criteria â€“ at least 1 lab abnormality \+ 1 clinical abnormality

**â€¢**Â Â Â Laboratory criteria (must confirm on two or more occasions, >12 weeks apart):

-Â Â Â Anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG or IgM)

-Â Â Â Anti-ÃŸ2**-**glycoprotein I antibodies (IgG or IgM)

-Â Â Â Lupus anticoagulant

**â€¢**Â Â Â Clinical features:

-Â Â Â Vascular thrombosis

-Â Â Â Pregnancy morbidity

-Â Â Â Treatment: Lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin (DOACs inferior in APLS), heparin during pregnancy

##### Secondary hypercoagulable states

â€¢Â Â Â Differential diagnosis: Malignancy, myeloproliferative disorders, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), immobilization, trauma, nephrotic syndrome, HIT, DIC
