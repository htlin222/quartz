# Screening of esophageal cancer
â€¢ Esophageal: screen for Barrettâ€™s w/ endoscopy if multiple risk factors (eg, hiatal hernia, age â‰¥50, male, chronic GERD, obese, smoking, FHx). Repeat q3â€“5y if Barrettâ€™s.
â€¢ Gastric: typically not screened in U.S. More common in regions w/ higher incidence (eg, Japan, Korea, Chile) w/ endoscopy or barium radiographs.
