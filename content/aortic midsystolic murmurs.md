# aortic midsystolic murmurs

## â€ƒObstructive

- Supravalvularâ€“supravalvular AS, coarctation of the aorta
- **Valvularâ€“AS** and aortic sclerosis
- Subvalvularâ€“discrete, tunnel or HOCM

> The obstructive form of [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (HOCM) is associated with a **midsystolic murmur** that is usually loudest along the left sternal border or between the left **lower sternal** border and the apex. The murmur is produced by both dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and MR, and thus, its configuration is a hybrid between ejection and regurgitant phenomena.

## â€ƒIncreased flow, hyperkinetic states, AR, complete heart block

- Dilation of ascending aorta, [[atheroma]], aortitis
