# tp53_sequencing_in_mantle_cell_lymphoma

- TP53 mutation has been associated with poor prognosis in patients treated with conventional therapy, including transplant.
- Clinical trial is strongly recommended for these patients.
- TP53 sequencing is preferred; however, in the front-line setting, TP53 by IHC can be used as a surrogate but should be
  - confirmed with sequencing.
  - NGS?
