# If transplant eligible-of-treatment of multiple myeloma

- after induction chemo
- then high-dose melphalan + auto-HSCT.
- Not curative, but â†‘ progression-free survival (PFS) vs. chemo alone (NEJM 2014;371:895, Lancet Onc 2015;16:1617).
- Offer if good perf.
- status & no prohibitive comorbid.
- Maint Rx w/ R improves PFS/OS (NEJM 2014;371:10).
- Timing of HSCT (upfront vs. relapse) debatable.
