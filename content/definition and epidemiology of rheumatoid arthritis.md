- Risk stems from combination of genetics (~50% of risk), environmental influences (eg, smoking, silica dust), and Pt factors (periodontal disease, Î”s in gut microbiome)
- _HLA-DRB1_ haplotype a/w disease suscept., severity, & response to Rx (JAMA 2015;313:1645)
- Prevalence =
  - 1/100 adults and 1/20 â™€ >70 y;
  - â™€ to â™‚ ratio = 3:1;
  - peak incidence 50-75 y
