### Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prevention

â€¢Â Â Â **FOURIER.** *N Engl J Med* 2017;376(18):1713-1722.

-Â Â Â Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that included 27,564 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of 70 mg/dL or higher who were receiving statin therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive evolocumab (PCSK9 inhibitor, either 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly) or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. Relative to placebo, evolocumab treatment significantly reduced the risk of the composite primary end point (1344 patients \[9.8%\] vs. 1563 patients \[11.3%\]).
