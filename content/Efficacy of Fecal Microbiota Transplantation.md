# Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation

*   Evidence Synopsis


    In adults and children with recurrent or refractory *C. difficile* infection (CDI), FMT appears safe and may be associated with higher rates of clinical cure without recurrence than antibiotics alone. Most studies have investigated FMT following treatment with antibiotics (usually vancomycin).


        **fecal microbiota, live-jslm may reduce CDI diarrhea in adults with recurrent CDI and prior treatment with antibiotics**

    *   **single administration of FMT may have approximately 76% cure rate** in patients with recurrent or refractory *C. difficile* infection

    *   **FMT after vancomycin might have higher rates of clinical resolution with negative *C. difficile* testing than fidaxomicin alone or vancomycin alone for treatment of recurrent *C. difficile*\-associated diarrhea in adults**

    *   **FMT appears effective and safe in children and young adults with recurrent, refractory, or severe *C. difficile* infection**


#### Comparative efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) techniques for Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection

*   studied modes of FMT delivery include<sup><a data-tip="#GUID-27C15D55-90E0-42AD-B061-5E2F3476950F__KRAJICEK2019" href="https://www.dynamed.com/procedure/fecal-microbiota-transplantation#GUID-27C15D55-90E0-42AD-B061-5E2F3476950F__KRAJICEK2019" currentitem="false">2</a></sup>
    *   colonic delivery (most common) via retention enema, sigmoidoscopy, endoscopy, or colonoscopy
    *   upper gastrointestinal delivery via nasoenteric tube or upper endoscopy
    *   oral capsules
    *   fresh or frozen preparations
*   **oral delivery of FMT is as effective as infusion by colonoscopy for preventing recurrence of *C. difficile* infection in patients with recurrent infections**

*   **FMT delivered by enema with fresh or frozen donor sample appear equally effective for resolution of diarrhea in patients with recurrent or refractory *C. difficile* infection**

*   **FMT reported to have high rate of clinical resolution in patients with recurrent *C. difficile* infection, but rates vary by infusion method and technique**
