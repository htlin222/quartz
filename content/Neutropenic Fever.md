-Â Â Â This clinical practice guideline from the IDSA is intended to guide the use of antimicrobial agents in patients with cancer who develop fever in the setting of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. It includes the risk stratification algorithm to determine which patients are at high- and low-risk of complications.
