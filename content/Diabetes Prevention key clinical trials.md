### Diabetes Prevention

â€¢Â Â Â **Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).** *N Engl J Med* 2002;346(6):393â€“403.

-Â Â Â Multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial that randomized 3234 middle-aged adults to intensive lifestyle counseling (dietary changes and 150 minutes of exercise per week for a weight loss goal of â‰¥7%) versus usual care. The intensive lifestyle counseling reduced the onset of diabetes by 58% compared to usual care. Metformin treatment reduced the onset of diabetes by 31%. These benefits persisted though the studyâ€™s 15-yr follow-up.
