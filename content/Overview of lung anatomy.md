### Overview

â€¢Â Â Â Mech  
anics:

-Â Â Â **Statics** refer to forces acting  
on the lung that affect volumes and elastic behavior

**â€¢**Â Â Â Lungs = collapsing forces; chest wall (CW) = expanding forces (Figure 2.2)



**FIGURE 2.2: The lungâ€“chest wall system.** The chest wall has a tendency toward expansion, while the lungs have a tendency toward collapse. At the end of a normal exhalation, the volume of air remaining in the lungs is the functional reserve capacity. While at the functional reserve capacity, the expanding chest wall forces and the collapsing lung forces are in balance. Since initiating a new breath requires the lungâ€“chest wall system to shift away from this equilibrium point, inhalation is an active process that requires the use of the respiratory muscles.

-Â Â Â **Dynamics** refer to the forces moving air, including flow patterns and resistance

â€¢Â Â Â Gas exchange: Handling of O2/CO2
