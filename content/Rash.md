### Rash

â€¢Â Â Â Approach to the patient with a rash:

-Â Â Â General approach: Typically, start with a physical exam before taking an extensive history

-Â Â Â Where is the rash? (Site of onset? How has it progressed or spread? Is there a specific distribution? Terms: Localized, diffuse, flexural, dermatomal)

-Â Â Â What does it look like? (Size? Flat or raised? Shape? Color? Terms: Macule, plaque, annular, salmon-colored)

-Â Â Â Are there any associated symptoms? (Itching or burning? Skin pain? Systemic symptoms?)

-Â Â Â Recent medications and skin care products? (Ask about prescribed and over-the-counter medications as well as herbal remedies, soaps, and lotions)

-Â Â Â Allergies?

-Â Â Â Occupational exposures or recent travel history?

-Â Â Â Ongoing or recent illnesses?

-Â Â Â Are there any red flags that warrant urgent dermatologic consultation? (Skin pain? Blistering? Mucous membrane involvement? Extensive body surface area (BSA) involvement? Purpura? Immunocompromise?)

â€¢Â Â Â Steps to describing a rash: It is helpful to have a systematic approach (See Figure 11.2)
