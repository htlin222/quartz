### Metabolic Etiologies of Liver Disease

##### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)

â€¢Â Â Â Risk factors: Associated with obesity, HLD, DM2

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Patients are usually asymptomatic but 10â€“20% of patients progress and develop cirrhosis (especially patients with NASH, which is an advanced form of NAFLD)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Can make presumptive diagnosis but need liver biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Histology appears similar to cirrhosis due to alcohol use, but patient reports no/minimal alcohol use.

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Control risk factors for insulin resistance, weight loss, consider bariatric surgery. OK to use statins. Vitamin E is sometimes used for nondiabetic NASH.

##### Wilsonâ€™s disease

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Autosomal recessive mutation of the *ATP7B* gene that encodes for ceruloplasmin (copper-binding protein needed for excretion); therefore, copper accumulates in the liver and blood. Typical age of onset is 5â€“35 yr.

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features:

-Â Â Â Liver: Acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure

-Â Â Â Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings, yellow rings in cornea

-Â Â Â CNS: Copper deposits in the basal ganglia which can cause extrapyramidal signs (parkinsonism), depression, paranoia

-Â Â Â Renal: Aminoaciduria, nephrocalcinosis

-Â Â Â Hemolytic anemia: Caused by sudden release of copper from liver cells

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Low serum ceruloplasmin, high urine copper, molecular test for mutation in *ATP7B* gene

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Penicillamine or trientine (chelator), zinc (prevents dietary copper uptake), liver transplantation

##### Hemochromatosis

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Autosomal recessive disease of iron absorption; excess iron is absorbed in the gut and accumulates as ferritin and hemosiderin in organs, causing fibrosis

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Bronze diabetes (deposits in the pancreas), arthralgias, hepatomegaly, impotence, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Ratio of iron to TIBC â‰¥45%, ferritin >150 ng/mL (women) and >200 ng/mL (men). Definitive diagnosis = HFE gene testing with C282Y polymorphism

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Repeat phlebotomy for patients with ferritin >500 ng/mL, evidence of tissue injury, or increased tissue iron by imaging/biopsy. Target ferritin to normal range. Counsel patients to avoid raw seafood (increased risk of *Vibrio* infection). Liver transplantation may be necessary.

##### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

â€¢Â Â Â Pathophysiology: Autosomal recessive disease that causes deficiency in alpha-1 antitrypsin production

â€¢Â Â Â Clinical features: Lung (emphysema) and liver disease (cirrhosis, HCC, hepatitis)

â€¢Â Â Â Diagnosis: Low serum alpha-1 antitrypsin

â€¢Â Â Â Treatment: Liver transplantation
