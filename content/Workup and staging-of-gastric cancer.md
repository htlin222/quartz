# Workup and staging-of-gastric cancer

Upper endoscopy + bx (perform on any gastric ulcer); EUS can be used for T stage, suboptimal for LN staging; EUS-guided FNA is better
CT CAP may detect occult M1 dz (bone, liver) in âˆ¼10% pts; consider esp if locally adv dz; consider PET if no evidence of M1 dz; laparoscopy w/ peritoneal washings detects M1 dz in âˆ¼20% pts
