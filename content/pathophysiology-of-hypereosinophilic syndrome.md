# pathophysiology-of-hypereosinophilic syndrome

- In hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), eosinophils damage the tissues that they infiltrate.
- Common target organs include the skin, lung, and gastrointestinal tract.
- Less commonly, patients can have potentially life-threatening damage to the cardiovascular system and brain.
- Activated eosinophils may damage tissues in a number of mechanisms, which are described in more detail separately. (See "Eosinophil biology and causes of eosinophilia".)

- Eosinophils are derived from myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow, through the action of three hematopoietic cytokines: granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and interleukin-5 (IL-5).
- Of these three, only IL-5 is specific for eosinophil differentiation.
