# Diagnostic evaluation-hemolytic anemias

* ↑ retic count (RI >2%),
* ↑ LDH,
* ↓ hapto (83% Se, 96% Sp),
* ↑ indirect bili,
* ✓ vit C & Cu

* [[Autoimmune hemolysis]]

## Location of hemolysis

> (many conditions can include components of both)

### Intravascular
RBC destruction in vessels
(shear by mech valve, DIC, toxins);
assoc. w/
	hemoglobinemia,
	hemoglobinuria,
	hemosiderinuria,

* ↑↑ LDH, ↓ haptoglobin.

### Extravascular:
more common cause.
Mϕ clear damaged/opsonized RBC;
splenomegaly
	(reticuloendothelial expansion in spleen, liver, BM, LNs);

* ↑ LDH ↓ hapto

* Family h/o anemia; personal or family h/o cholelithiasis
