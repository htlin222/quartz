### Cutaneous Drug Reactions

##### Morbilliform drug eruption

•   Pathophysiology: Most common type of cutaneous drug reaction (~75 to 90% of cases); common culprits include antibiotics, antiepileptics, NSAIDs, and calcium channel blockers

•   Clinical features: Presents with erythematous macules and papules coalescing into patches on the trunk, back, and extremities (“morbilliform” = measles-like)

•   Treatment: Discontinue unnecessary medications, treat symptoms with oral antihistamines \+/− topical steroids, may attempt to “treat through” if mild and no substitute medication is available

##### Erythema multiforme

•   Pathophysiology: Immune-mediated eruption that can mimic SJS/TEN; typically caused by infection (~90% of cases) but can also be due to a drug reaction; commonly associated infections such as HSV, Mycoplasma

•   Clinical features: Characterized by “true target” lesions with three distinct zones on the extremities including the palms and soles; may have mucocutaneous involvement

•   Treatment: Discontinue unnecessary medications, treat infection if applicable, treat symptoms with oral antihistamines \+/− topical steroids
