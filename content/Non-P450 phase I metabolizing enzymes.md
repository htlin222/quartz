# Non-P450 phase I metabolizing enzymes

- Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD):
  - The 1st & rate-limiting step in catabolism of pyrimidine bases, uracil & thymidine
- [[5-FU]] & [[capecitabine]] (prodrug for 5-FU) metabolized by DPD to inactive metabolites in liver
- DPD deficiency leads to
  - increased exposure & prolonged T1/2 of 5-FU â†’ sev. myelosuppression, GI & neurologic tox
- 39 polymorphisms & mts of the DPD gene are known; DPD\*2A the most common polymorphism â†’ inactive enzyme in 0.9% of Caucasian pts
