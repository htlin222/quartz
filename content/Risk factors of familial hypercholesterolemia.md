# Risk factors of familial hypercholesterolemia

The risk of familial hypercholesterolemia is higher if one or both of your parents have the gene alteration that causes it. Most people who have the condition receive one affected gene. But in rare cases, a child can get the affected gene from both parents. This can cause a more severe form of the condition.

Familial hypercholesterolemia may be more common in certain populations, including:

* Ashkenazi Jews
* Some Lebanese groups
* French Canadians
