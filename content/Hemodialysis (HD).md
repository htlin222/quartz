# Hemodialysis (HD)

* Solute removal across semipermeable membrane, countercurrent blood & dialysate flow

	* Volume removal: Na/H2O ultrafiltered via **transmembrane pressure** (TMP) gradient
	* Solutes: Cr, urea, K diffuse from blood → dialysate, HCO3 from dialysate → blood
	* Solute removal inversely proportional to size ∴ effective removal of K, urea, Cr, not PO4

* 6× vs. 3×/wk improved HTN, LV mass, QoL, but ↑ vasc issues (NEJM 2010;363:2287); w/ 3×/wk HD, ↑ mortality risk during 2-d interval (Sa–Tu or Fri–Mo) (NEJM 2011;365:1099)

* Fever w/ catheter: empiric abx (vanc + GNR coverage qHD). GPC >GNR >mixed/fungal. Remove/replace catheter (depends on organism), “lock” abx (JASN 2014;25:2927).
