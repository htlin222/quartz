# Diagnostic studies and monitoring of systemic sclerosis and scleroderma disorders

- Autoantibodies: >95% Pts w/ auto-Ab; generally mutually exclusive
  - âŠ• anti-Scl-70 (anti-topoisomerase 1): a/w diffuse SSc; â†‘ risk pulm fibrosis
  - âŠ• anticentromere: a/w limited SSc; â†‘ risk of severe digit ischemia and PHT
  - âŠ• anti-RNA-Pol III: a/w diffuse SSc; â†‘ risk renal crisis; a/w cancer
  - âŠ• ANA (>90%), âŠ• RF (30%), âŠ• anti-U1-RNP a/w overlap syndrome
  - Other: anti-Th/To (a/w limited SSc), U3-RNP (a/w ILD), PmScl (polymyositis-SSc overlap)
- [[CXCL4]] levels reported to correlate w/ degree of fibrosis (NEJM 2014;370:433)
- at â†£ baseline: âœ“ BUN/Cr & UA for proteinuria, PFTs (spirometry, lung volumes, DLCO), high- res chest CT (if diffuse disease), TTE (RVSP for PHT), RHC if â†‘ RVSP or suspect PHT
- Annual PFTs; TTE q1-2y
- Skin bx not routine, but helpful to assess other possible causes for skin thickening
- â†‘ risk of malignancy (esp. lung cancer) compared to general population
- Frequent (eg, daily) BP âœ“ to monitor for HTN suggestive of scleroderma renal crisis
