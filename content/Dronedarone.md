decrease side effects & effic. vs. [[Amiodarone]]

Dronedarone, which **lacks iodine** moieties of amiodarone, slows the resting rate in AF by an average of 12 bpm and also improves exercise heart rate control303; however, it should not be used for rate control in permanent AF, as it was found to **increase rates of HF**, stroke, cardiovascular death, and unplanned hospitalization.282 Furthermore, dronedarone should not be used for ventricular rate control in patients with **HF and LV systolic dysfunction because it increases** the likelihood of the combined endpoint of stroke, MI, systemic embolism, or cardiovascular death.
