# understanding_genetic_maps

Maps tell us where things are. More specifically, they tell us where things are in relation to other things. In genomics, maps have been essential in revealing the organization of the hereditary material.
Different types of map describe different types of observation:

1. Linkage maps of genes
2. Banding patterns of chromosomes
3. Restriction maps - DNA cleavage fragment patterns
4. DNA sequences.
