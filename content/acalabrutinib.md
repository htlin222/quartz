# acalabrutinib

Acalabrutinib is a targeted cancer drug used to treat various types of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) [1][3][4].

## Key points about acalabrutinib

- It is a [[bruton_tyrosine_kinase.md|Bruton tyrosine kinase]] (BTK) inhibitor that prevents the proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion of B cells [1][2].

- Acalabrutinib is more selective and potent than the first-in-class BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, with a better safety profile and reduced adverse effects like bleeding risk and severe diarrhea [3][5].

- In the EU, acalabrutinib is approved for previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL, either as monotherapy or with obinutuzumab. In the US, it is approved for relapsed/refractory MCL and CLL/SLL [3][4].

- Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, and weight gain. Serious side effects like atrial fibrillation, infections, and bleeding can occur [1][3][4].

- Acalabrutinib is taken orally as capsules twice daily, with or without food. Dose adjustments may be needed for certain drug interactions [1][4].

In summary, acalabrutinib is an effective targeted therapy for B-cell malignancies that offers improved selectivity and tolerability compared to earlier BTK inhibitors like ibrutinib [1][3][4][5].
