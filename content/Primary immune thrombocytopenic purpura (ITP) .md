# Primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)

- Isolated thrombocytopenia due to immune plt destruction (auto-Ab to plts) & â†“ production (auto-Ab to megakaryocytes) without precipitant

- Clinical manifestations: insidious onset of mucocutaneous bleeding;
- â™€:â™‚ = 3:1
- Diagnosis of exclusion (r/o 2Â° ITP); no robust clinical or lab parameters, but typically:
	- CBC: isolated â†“ plt (<100,000/ÂµL);
	- 10% have ITP + AIHA = [[Evans syndrome]]
	- Peripheral smear: large platelets (not specific), r/o pseudothrombocytopenia
	- BM bx: â†‘ megakaryocytes, nl cellularity. Consider if other CBC or smear abnl or diagnostic uncertainty (Blood 2011;117:4910).
- âœ“ HBSAg & anti-HBc prior to rituximab (and before IVIg, which could alter results)
- Treatment: rarely indicated if plt >50,000/ÂµL unless bleeding, trauma/surgery, anticoag.
