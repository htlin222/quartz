經過這麼多年後，熱騰騰的Hyponatremia review.

"Hyponatremia, which is defined as a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L, affects approximately 5% of adults. Approximately 20% of people who are older than 65 years of age have hyponatremia as well as 35% of patients who are hospitalized, 30% of patients with heart failure, and 50% of patients with cancer or cirrhosis. The pathogenesis of hyponatremia is complex and heterogenous and symptoms vary widely. Hyponatremia is associated with adverse outcomes. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased length of hospitalization, greater resource use, and higher mortality. This review summarizes current evidence regarding the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of hyponatremia."
