### Discharge Checklist

â€¢Â Â Â Approach to discharging a patient: Discharges from the hospital are a transition that creates a risk for breakdown in a patientâ€™s care. Table A1.8 provides a list of some important considerations to ensure a patient is ready for discharge. It is important to develop an approach to discharges that reflects the system at your institution, but we offer a possible template in Table A1.9.
