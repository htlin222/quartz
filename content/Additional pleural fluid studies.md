# Additional pleural fluid studies

(NEJM 2002;346:1971)
## NT-proBNP ≥1500 pg/mL
has 91% Se & 93% Sp for CHF (Am J Med 2004;116:417)

## WBC & diff.:
exudates tend to have ↑ WBC vs. transudates but nonspecific neutrophils
→ parapneumonic, PE, pancreatitis lymphocytes (>50%)
→ cancer, TB, rheumatologic eos (>10%)
→ blood, air, drug reaction, asbestos, paragonimiasis, Churg-Strauss, PE

## RBC:
Hcteff 1–20% → cancer, PE, trauma;
Hcteff/Hctblood >50% → hemothorax

## acid-fast bacilli
yield in TB 0–10% with stain, 11–50% with culture, ~70% with pleural bx
adenosine deaminase (ADA): seen with granulomas, >70 suggests TB, <40 excludes TB

## cytology:
ideally ≥150 mL and at least 60 mL should be obtained (Chest 2010;137:68)

## glucose:
<60 mg/dL → malignancy, infection, RA

## amylase
seen in pancreatic disease and esophageal rupture (salivary amylase)
rheumatoid factor, CH50, ANA: limited utility in dx collagen vascular disease

## triglycerides:
>110 → chylothorax, 50–110 → ✓ lipoprotein analysis for chylomicrons

## cholesterol:
>60; seen in chronic effusions (eg, CHF, RA, old TB)

## creatinine:
effusion/serum ratio >1 → urinothorax
fibulin-3: ↑ plasma and/or effusion levels → mesothelioma (NEJM 2012;367:1417)
