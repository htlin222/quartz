# Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score

* Quantifies extent of calcium; thus, estimates plaque burden (but not % coronary stenosis)
* CAC sensitive (91%) but not specific (49%) for presence of CAD; high NPV to r/o CAD
* In intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults (ie, 10-year ASCVD risk of 5â€“20%), if decision about statin remains uncertain, reasonable to use CAC score to help guide
