### Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)

Antiretroviral therapies are listed here, with select pros (\+) and cons (*-*) indicated.

##### Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)

â€¢Â Â Â Abacavir: (â€“) Risk hypersensitivity â€“ must rule out HLA-B\*5701 mutation first.

â€¢Â Â Â Tenofovir: (â€“) 1. Renal toxicity: Decreases GFR â†’ Risk of Fanconiâ€™s syndrome. 2. Decreased bone density and risk of osteoporosis.

-Â Â Â TAF and TDF are two forms of tenofovir

**â€¢**Â Â Â TAF has a lower risk of bone and renal toxicities

**â€¢**Â Â Â TDF is associated with lower lipid levels

â€¢Â Â Â Lamivudine: (\+) Well-tolerated (â€“) Higher risk of resistance

â€¢Â Â Â Emtricitabine: Very similar to lamivudine (think of them as being equivalent)

Â Â Â **\*\*** Abacavir/lamivudine and tenofovir/emtricitabine are often paired.

##### Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)

â€¢Â Â Â Efavirenz: (â€“) Can cause bad dreams, worsening of underlying psychiatric disorders and suicidality

â€¢Â Â Â Rilpivirine: (\+) Better tolerated (â€“) Higher likelihood of resistance, requires food and gastric acid for absorption (canâ€™t use with a PPI)

##### Protease inhibitors (PI)

â€¢Â Â Â Darunavir: (\+) Potent (i.e., high barrier to resistance) (â€“) Nausea, diarrhea, hyperlipidemia

â€¢Â Â Â Atazanavir: Causes an indirect hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbertâ€™s. Not harmful; can be an indication of medication compliance.

-Â Â Â Boosters: PIs are often given with a booster (ritonavir of cobicistat) to improve potency and allow for less frequent and lower dosing. Both ritonavir and cobicistat are CYP450 inhibitors.

-Â Â Â Drugâ€“drug interactions: PIs have many drugâ€“drug interactions. When patients are taking a PI, it is worth discussing any dosing modifications needed when a new drug is started. Common drug classes with drug-drug interactions in the setting of PI use include:

**â€¢**Â Â Â Acid reducers (PPIs, H2 blockers, antacids)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin, prazosin, etc.)

**â€¢**Â Â Â Anti-mycobacterial, macrolides, anti-fungals, and anti-malarials

**â€¢**Â Â Â Anti-coagulants (including DOACs, dabigatran, and warfarin), anti-platelets

**â€¢**Â Â Â Anti-convulsants

**â€¢**Â Â Â Anti-depressants, anxiolytics, and anti-psychotics

**â€¢**Â Â Â Anti-arrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone), beta-blockers

**â€¢**Â Â Â HCV treatment

**â€¢**Â Â Â Hormonal agents, including oral contraceptives

**â€¢**Â Â Â Statins

**â€¢**Â Â Â Opioids and medications used to treat opioid use disorder (e.g., buprenorphine, methadone)

##### Integrase inhibitors

â€¢Â Â Â Elvitegravir: (â€“) Lower barrier to resistance than dolutegravir

â€¢Â Â Â Dolutegravir: (\+) Difficult to become resistance (â€“) Small bump in Cr, but no change in GFR

â€¢Â Â Â Raltegravir: (â€“) BID dosing makes compliance more challenging

â€¢Â Â Â Bictegravir: (\+) High barrier to resistance, fewer side effects than dolutegravir (â€“) Small bump in Cr, similar to dolutegravir

##### Pharmacokinetic boosters

â€¢Â Â Â Ritonavir: (\+) Boosts protease inhibitors, increases trough so can be dosed daily (â€“) Nausea, diarrhea, hyperlipidemia

â€¢Â Â Â Cobicistat: Similar to above (â€“) Decreases tubular secretion, so should not be used in patients with CKD

##### C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receptor antagonist

â€¢Â Â Â Maraviroc: (â€“) Need to test tropism assay prior to use. Can cause hypersensitivity, hepatitis. Overall a less potent medication than others

##### Fusion inhibitors (not 1st line)

â€¢Â Â Â Enfuvirtide: (â€“) Injectable, very common to get injection site reactions

##### Common starting ARV regimens

â€¢Â Â Â Biktarvy = Bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine

â€¢Â Â Â Descovy \+ Tivicay = Tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine \+ dolutegravir (TAF/FTC \+ DTG)

â€¢Â Â Â Truvada \+ Tivicay = Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine \+ dolutegravir (TDF/FTC \+ DTG)

â€¢Â Â Â Raltegravir \+ (emtricitabine or lamivudine) \+ (TAF or TDF)

â€¢Â Â Â Triumeq = Dolutegravir-abacavir-lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC)

-Â Â Â Only use in patients confirmed to be HLA-B\*5701 negative given the adverse reaction associated with ABC in HLA-B\*5701 positive individuals

â€¢Â Â Â Dovato = Dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC)

-Â Â Â This regimen cannot be used when: 1) HIV RNA > 500,000 copies/mL, 2) there is HBV co-infection, or 3) ART is going to be started before HIV resistance testing for reverse transcriptase or HBV testing are available
