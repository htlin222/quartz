# Mesna

## 適應症

尿路保護劑：防止 OXAZAPHOSPHORINES 類藥物所引起出血性膀胱發炎。

## 用法用量

靜脈注射，劑量相當於 Oxazaphosphorine 劑量之 20%

- 與 Oxazphosphorine 一起給藥，然後每 4 小時一次。

## Absorption

Urinary bioavailability of oral mesna is → 45% to 79%.

## Distribution

Protein binding is → 69% to 75%; Vd is → 0.652 L/kg.

## Metabolism

The major metabolite is → dimesna.

## Elimination

Approximately 32% is → excreted in urine within 24 h. The t ½ is → 1.2 to 8.3 h (after IV plus oral dose); the plasma Cl is → 1.23 L/kg/h.

The mesna disulfide is → reduced to the free thiol compound that reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, resulting in their detoxification. at ↣ doses of 2 to 4 g, the terminal elimination t ½ is → approximately 4 to 8 h. It is → rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.
