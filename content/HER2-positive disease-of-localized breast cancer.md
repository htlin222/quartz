# HER2-positive disease-of-localized breast cancer

Anti-HER2 agents approved in (neo) adj. setting
Trastuzumab (Herceptin, H): Recombinant, humanized mAb binds to extracellular HER2 domain
Pertuzumab (P): MAb, inhibits HER2 dimerization
T-DM1: Antibody-drug conjugate of trastuzumab + antimicrotubule agent
Duration: 6 mos of H not noninferior to 12 (PHARE, Lancet Oncol 2013;14:741, PERSPHONE trial. Lancet 2019;393:2599-2612); 24 mos = 12 mos (HERA, Lancet 2013;382:1021)
Toxicities: Cardiac, NYHA III-IV or G3-4 cardiac events <4%. Risk â†‘ if pretreated w/ anthracycline. Addition of P: No further â†‘ in risk
Echo/MUGA at baseline, postanthracycline, & serially every 3 mos. If symptomatic â†“ in EF or asx â†“ EF â‰¥ 10% below LLN or â‰¥ 16%, hold H
Stage I: TH followed by H in T1b/c, consider for T1a
cStage II-III: NAC is rec. ddACT-THP or TCbHP (taxane/carbo + HP)
Addition of P: â†‘ pCR (46% v. 29%) (NeoSphere, Lancet Onc 2012;13:25)
pCR âˆ¼ 60% w/ HP + anthra & T, no â†‘ cardiotox (TRYPHAENA, Ann Oncol 2013;24:2278; BERENICE, ESMO Breast 2021)
Anthracycline-free regimen: TCbHP every 3 wks Ã— 9 cycles. pCR rate & 3 y EFS of TCbHP â‰ˆ FEC - TCbHP (TRAIN2, JAMA Onc 2021;7:978-984)
If non-PCR: T-DM1 for 14 cycles (KATHERINE, NEJM 2019;380:617-628)
pStage II-III: After surgery â†’ adj. AC-THP (APHINITY, NEJM 2017;377:122-131)
