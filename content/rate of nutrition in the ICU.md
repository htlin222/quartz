# rate of nutrition in the ICU

The recommendation in critically ill patients is to initiate feeding at 20%âˆ’30% of metabolic need during the first week in the ICU. Metabolic requirements can be calculated from one of many online calculators
(e.g., ClinCalc, SurgicalCriticalCare.net). Standard practice is to initiate early enteral nutrition when a patient can tolerate it.
