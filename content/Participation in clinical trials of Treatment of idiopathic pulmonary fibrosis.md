# Participation in clinical trials of Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
While antifibrotic agents slow disease progression, a therapeutic response is obtained in only a portion of patients, and survival is poor even for those who respond. A number of potential therapies are in various stages of development. Participation in clinical trials is an important way to improve the therapeutic options available for IPF. (See 'Future directions' above and 'Clinical trials' above.)
