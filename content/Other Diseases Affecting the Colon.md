### Other Diseases Affecting the Colon

##### Angiodysplasia of the colon (AV malformations, vascular ectasia)

•   Clinical features: Tortuous dilated veins in the colon can rupture and cause a lower GI bleed. Classic association is Heyde’s syndrome (triad of aortic stenosis, acquired vWF deficiency due to shear stress from the aortic valve, and GI bleeding from angiodysplasia)

•   Diagnosis: Colonoscopy

•   Treatment: Bleeding is typically self-limited

##### Ischemic colitis

•   Definitions: Ischemia in the mesenteric distribution specifically affecting the large intestine

•   Pathophysiology: Colonic hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension (e.g., MI, aortoiliac surgery)

•   Clinical features: Sudden abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia

•   Diagnosis: CT abd/pelvis with contrast. Early colonoscopy shows patchy segmental ulcerations

•   Treatment: Usually just supportive care; if severe and necrotic bowel, may need surgical resection

##### Colonic polyps

•   Adenoma: Premalignant. Three subtypes: 1) Tubular adenoma, 2) Tubulovillous adenoma, 3) Villous adenoma (most worrisome)

•   Serrated: 1) Hyperplastic polyp (benign), 2) Sessile serrated polyp (premalignant), 3) Traditional serrated adenoma (premalignant)

•   Other: 1) Hamartomatous polyp (variable potential for transformation); 2) Inflammatory polyp (benign).

-   After premalignant polyps are removed, typically recommend closer interval surveillance colonoscopy (interval depends on size and number).

##### Sigmoid volvulus

•   Pathophysiology: Occurs when a loop of the sigmoid bowel twists around its own mesentery, resulting in obstruction and underperfusion.

•   Clinical features: Insidious onset of abdominal pain, nausea, and distension, eventually with severe continuous abdominal pain and colicky episodes. More common age >70 yr, M>F, patients with comorbid neuropsychiatric diseases.

•   Diagnosis: CT abd/pelvis with “whirl pattern” (dilated sigmoid around mesocolon/vessels) and “bird-beak” appearance of adjacent colonic segments; if not present, absence of rectal gas, separation of sigmoid walls, and two transition points are suggestive.

•   Treatment: Emergent surgery if peritonitis/perforation. If stable, sigmoidoscopy to diagnose and detorse the twisted segment, followed by surgery.

##### Cecal volvulus

•   Pathophysiology: Occurs when a segment of the cecum rotates/torses, resulting in obstruction and underperfusion. More common in younger women.

•   Clinical features: Presentation varies widely from insidious abdominal pain/vomiting to abdominal catastrophe

•   Diagnosis: CT abd/pelvis with “whirl pattern,” as with sigmoid volvulus, but with the anatomic location at the cecum.

•   Treatment: Primarily surgical management

##### Radiation proctitis

•   Pathophysiology: Inflammation of the rectum as a result of damage due to pelvic radiation (e.g., for prostate cancer, cervical cancer)

•   Clinical features:

-   Acute: Diarrhea, mucus discharge, urgency, and tenesmus within 6 weeks of radiation

-   Chronic: Same symptoms >9 months after radiation exposure. Chronic radiation proctitis can cause bleeding. Treat with endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC).

•   Diagnosis: Diagnosis of exclusion. Endoscopic findings are nonspecific (pallor with friability, telangiectasia); biopsy demonstrates submucosal fibrosis.

•   Treatment: Supportive care, sucralfate enemas, hyperbaric oxygen

##### Hemorrhoids

•   Pathophysiology: Varicose veins of the anus/rectum. Risk factors include constipation, pregnancy, portal hypertension, and obesity.

•   Clinical features: Bright red blood on the toilet paper when wiping.

-   External: Dilated veins from inferior hemorrhoidal plexus distal to dentate line (sensate area) – *painful*\!

-   Internal: Dilated submucosal veins of superior rectal plexus above dentate line (insensate area) – *painless*\!

•   Treatment: Sitz bath, ice packs, stool softeners, topical steroids. If internal hemorrhoids are severe, can pursue rubber band ligation or surgery.
