# Normal platelet function-hemostasis

- Production:
  - Regulated by hormone TPO secreted from liver & acting on megakaryocytes in BM;
  - 1 Ã— 1011 produced daily, circulate for 7-10 d
- Adhesion:
  - Endothelial injury â†’ plt activation & binding via GPIb-IX to VWF or via GPVI, integrin Î±2Î²1 to the subendothelial matrix (eg, collagen)
- Aggregation:
  - Activated GPIIb-IIIa binds VWF & fibrinogen to form clumps â†’ ADP & serotonin released from granules â†’ additional plt recruited
- Pseudothrombocytopenia:
  - Falsely â†“ plt count due to plt clumping, seen on peripheral smear; mgmt: Collect blood in non-EDTA, citrate-or heparin-containing tube
