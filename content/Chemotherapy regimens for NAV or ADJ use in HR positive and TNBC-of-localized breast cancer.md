# Chemotherapy regimens for NAV or ADJ use in HR positive and TNBC-of-localized breast cancer

- 3 most common regimens:
  - [[CMF]] (cyclophosphamide, MTX, 5-FU),
  - [[CAF]]
  - [[TC]] (docetaxel, cyclophosphamide),
  - dd (dose-dense) [[ACbyT]] (doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide Ã—4, followed by paclitaxel Ã—4 or weekly paclitaxel Ã—12)
    - Dose dense schedule (q2w) + G-CSF > 3 wk regimen
    - â†’ â†“ of 10-y risk of recurrence or death (Lancet 2019;393:1440-1452)
- [[Anthracycline]] (Anthra) & taxane-based tx \> TC if HER2(âˆ’) & high-risk
  - [[ABC trial]], JCO 2017;35(23): 2647-2655
- If low-risk, TC not < ACT (PlanB, JCO 2019;37(10):799-808)
- CMF:
  - â†‘ OS at 30-y follow-up (RR of death = 0.79) vs. no chemo after surgery (BMJ 2005;330:217);
  - not rec for high-risk dz

## Highlight

- â†‘ DFS & OS w/ anthra containing tx > CMF ([[EBCTCG]], Lancet 2005;365:1687)
- â†‘ DFS w/ anthra & T-containing tx > TC Ã— 6 for HER2(âˆ’) high-risk pts ([[ABC trial]], JCO 2016;34:1000)
- â†‘ DFS & OS when taxane added to anthra-based regimens (EBCTCG Lancet 2012;379:432; NSABP B-28, JCO 2005;23:3686)
