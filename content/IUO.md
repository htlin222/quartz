# IUO

## inflammation of unknown origin (IUO),
- cf [[fever of unknown origin]]
- same definition as [[FUO]], except for the body temperature criterion: IUO is defined as the presence of elevated inflammatory parameters (CRP or ESR) on multiple occasions for a period of at least 3 weeks in an immunocompetent patient with normal body temperature, for which a final explanation is lacking despite history-taking, physical examination, and the obligatory tests listed above.
