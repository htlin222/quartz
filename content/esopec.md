# esopec

Key Points:

The randomized phase 3 ESOPEC trial compared perioperative chemotherapy (FLOT) against neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CROSS) in patients with resectable, locally advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
Perioperative FLOT improved median overall survival (OS) by 29 months when compared with neoadjuvant CROSS.
Surgical complications and postoperative mortality were similar in the FLOT and CROSS arms.
