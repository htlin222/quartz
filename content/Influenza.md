### Influenza

â€¢Â Â Â **Diagnosis of influenza in intensive care units: Lower respiratory tract samples are better than nose-throat swabs.** *Am J Respir Crit Care Med* 2012;186(9):929â€“930.

-Â Â Â This brief communication to the editor includes important data on the frequency of discordant upper and lower respiratory tract specimens tested for influenza via PCR methods. This supports the idea that critically ill patients with negative upper respiratory tract specimens should also undergo testing of lower respiratory tract specimens (e.g., endotracheal aspirate) for ongoing presence of influenza virus.
