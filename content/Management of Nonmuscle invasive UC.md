# Management of Nonmuscle invasive UC

Depends on T stage & grade: TURBT, followed by either observation for low risk, or intravesical therapy w/ BCG or chemo (mitomycin or gemcitabine) (Eur Urol 2021;79(4):480; J Urol 2005;174(1):86; JNCI 2001;93(8):597)
Strongly consider reresection if no muscle in TURBT specimen for accurate staging
The majority (50-80%) of nonmuscle invasive dz will recur if treated by TURBT alone, w/ a proportion (20-25%) progressing to more invasive dz
Cystectomy considered for residual T1, high-grade or muscle-invasion at reresection
BCG: Unknown exact MOA, but triggers local immune response, given weekly Ã— 6 wks followed by maintenance for 1-3 y based on risk status for relapse.
Pembrolizumab: Given IV for pts with BCG-unresponsive CIS Â± papillary dz who were ineligible for or declined radical cystectomy (Lancet Onc 2021;22:919-930)
Surveillance: Cystoscopy & urine cytology âˆ¼3 mos, can be spaced if no recurrent dz
