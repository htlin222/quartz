# checkmate_141

The CheckMate 141 study showed that nivolumab treatment resulted in longer overall survival (7.5 months) compared to standard, single-agent therapy (5.1 months) in patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, with a response rate of 13.3% vs. 5.8% and a lower rate of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 (13.1% vs. 35.1%).
