(BloodÂ 2006;107:13)

* HIV âŠ• imparts 60â€“100Ã— relative risk

* NHL is an AIDS-defining malignancy along with Kaposiâ€™s, cervical CA, anal CA

* Concurrent HAART & chemotherapy likely provide survival benefit

* DLBCL & immunoblastic lymphoma (67%): CD4 <100, EBV-associated. Burkitt lymphoma (20%): can occur with CD4 >200. Generally, treat as immunocompetent, but avoid rituximab if CD4 <50 (due to increased risk of death from infection).

* Primary CNS lymphoma (16%): CD4 <50, EBV-assoc. (also seen in Pts w/o HIV). Rx w/ high-dose MTX-based regimen + steroid Â± temozolomide Â± RT, consider auto HSCT.
