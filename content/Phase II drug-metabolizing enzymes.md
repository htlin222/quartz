# Phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes

- Thiopurine methyltransferase ([[TPMT]]): Involved in the metabolism of thiopurines (6-MP, AZA) through S-methylation to inactive metabolites
- TPMT\*2, TPMT\*3A, & TPMT\*3C
  - account for 95% of pts w/ TPMT deficiency
  - Pts who carry TPMT polymorphisms are at risk of sev. hematologic tox; pts homozygous for TPMT allele variation have 4Ã— increased risk of tox
- Appropriate 6-MP dose reductions for TPMT-deficient pts have allowed for similar tox & survival outcomes when compared to pts w/ normal levels
- Tests for TPMT genotype & phenotype are commercially available

- Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 ([[UGT1A1]])
