# extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis

(18-41% of Pts) can occur at ↣ any time; ↑ frequency in seropositive (⊕ RF or anti-CCP) and w/ active disease (Autoimmun Rev 2021;20:102776)

## Skin

- Rheumatoid nodules (_20-30%,_ usually seropositive):
  - extensor surface, bursae;
  - can be in lung, heart, sclera
- Raynaud's → [[Raynaud phenomenon]], [[pyoderma gangrenosum]],
  - cutaneous vasculitis (ulcers, purpura, etc.)

## Pulm

- ILD (associated with _MUC5B_ mutations),
- airway disease, pleuritis, effusions (low glucose), nodules, pulmonary hypertension;
- precedes joint symptoms in 20% of cases;
- RA medication toxicity (MTX, ? anti-TNF, & anti-CD20)

## CV

- Accelerated atherosclerosis with increased risk of MI & CV death, _AF_, pericarditis (effusions in 1/3 of seropositive cases), myocarditis, coronary/systemic vasculitis

## Nervous

- _Nerve entrapment_ (e.g., _carpal tunnel_), stroke, mononeuritis multiplex, CNS vasculitis

## Ocular

- 鞏膜炎、結膜炎：Scleritis, episcleritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (secondary Sjögren's)

## Heme

- Anemia of chronic disease, neutropenia ([[Felty's syndrome]]: 1%, typically long-standing RA + splenomegaly; large granular lymphocyte leukemia: bone marrow infiltrated with lymphocytes ± myeloid hypoplasia), NHL, amyloidosis

## Renal

- Glomerulonephritis (usually mesangial), nephrotic syndrome (secondary amyloidosis), nephrotoxicity from RA medications

## Vasculitis

- Small & medium vessels (usually high RF titer, long-standing RA); pericarditis, ulcers, scleritis, & neuropathy most common
